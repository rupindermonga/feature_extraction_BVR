Definitely worth paying a little extra for this one over the 2nd generation model. I'm not going to discuss the functionality as there's tons of info already out there. One important note: If you set up the Alexa app on your phone, IT WILL IMPORT ALL OF YOUR PHONE CONTACTS. I didn't think I gave it permission to do so but Alexa did indeed import my contacts! You may have read stories how, WITHOUT YOUR KNOWLEDGE, Alexa can record what's being said in your home and then send it to ANY or ALL of those contacts! Yikes! And, I won't want any of my kids to accidentally send messages to or call people on my contact list. So, if you want to keep your contacts from Alexa and prevent that from happening here's how I did it:\n\nBefore installiing the Alexa app on your phone, export your contacts to a file and save it for later. Then, go back to the phone and delete those contacts (don't worry, you'll import them back in later). Now, install the Alexa app on your phone and go through the set up process. At some point, you'll have the option to allow Alexa to automatically import any additions to your contacts. Please \"disable\" that option. After you're done with the installation, you'll notice there are no contacts in your Alexa app! Now, you can import your contacts back into your phonebook using the file that you initially created and you're good to go!\n\nIf you already installed the app but want to delete your contacts from Alexa, it's not too late. Simply export your phone contacts to a file and save for later. Then, delete the contacts from your phone. Now, open the Alexa app and click \"Contacts.\" On the Contacts page, click on \"Import Contacts\" and enable it by moving the button to the right side. This will cause Alexa to replace your existing contacts with the now empty phonebook. After a few minutes, your Alexa contacts will be gone. Go back and disable \"Import Contacts\" to prevent Alexa from importing them in the future. You can now import the contact file that you created back into your phone.\n\nOf course there may be some contacts you do want to use with Alexa. I simply added them manually by clicking \"Add Contact.\"\n\nI hope this info is helpful as I wasn't able to find an easy way to manage Alexa contacts."},{"reviewerName":"Frederick","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Love the Dot and its new look, but the sound is still disappointing","reviewDate":"October 15, 2018","reviewText":"I've been a happy owner of a 2nd generation Echo and three 2nd generation Echo Dots for a year now, and I was glad to add this to the arsenal. After using it for a few days I am generally pleased with it, but it does have limitations, especially when it comes to sound quality (no surprise there!). I will start by summarizing what's new about the 3rd Generation Dot, then I'll describe the device in more detail, and finally I'll add some thoughts about how to choose which Echo device may be best for you.\n\nThe most obvious update to the Dot is the new look: it's as if someone took a 2nd generation Dot, inflated it with an air pump, and wrapped the edge in fabric. And it's not bad!\n\nWhat's different/updated in the 3rd Generation Dot:\n1) It is slightly larger than the 2nd generation device, measuring 3.9\" wide x 1.7\" tall (2nd gen was 3.3\" wide x 1.3\" tall), and the top and bottom edges are more rounded. It is also substantially heavier at nearly twice the weight of the 2nd generation model.\n2) The 2nd generation Dot came in two color options (black and white), each of which had a shiny plastic exterior that I personally thought looked a little cheap. The 3rd generation Dot has a fabric exterior which gives it a classier appearance, and it's available in three colors: heather grey, sandstone, and charcoal. The fabric and rounded edges give the 3rd generation Dot a much softer look than its predecessor.\n4) The 3rd generation Dot has a larger speaker (1.6\", versus 1.1\" on the 2nd gen), which is paired with a larger driver as well. I'll talk below about the effect this has on audio quality.\n5) The placement of the microphones is slightly different: while the 2nd generation had seven small far-field microphones on its top surface; the 3rd generation has four microphones.\n\n---------------------------\nOverall appearance\n---------------------------\nI purchased the \"sandstone\" version. The cloth is a polyester woven fabric made up of lighter and darker shades which gives it more visual interest than if it were just a solid, uniform gray. The neutral color blends in with nearly any decor, and the cloth gives the unit a softer look which is great for areas of your house where you don't want something that screams \"I'm a device!\"\n\nAside from its larger size and slight convex bulge, the top of the device is nearly identical to that of the 2nd generation Dot: it has four buttons (volume up, volume down, microphone off, and an \"action\" button) and a multi-colored light ring around the top edge that tells you about the Echo's status. The side of the device has an input for the power cable and a 3.5-mm output jack.\n\nOne notable improvement is the shape of the power cable, which sits flatter against the wall than the 2nd generation Dot's cable (see my photo to see them side by side). This may sound like an insignificant change, but it makes a huge difference if you want to plug the cable into an outlet that is behind a piece of furniture.\n\n-------------\nSetup\n-------------\nSetting up the Dot couldn't be easier. You simply plug in the power cable, then use the Alexa app on your phone to connect the Dot to your WiFi network. The app leads you through everything, and the whole process takes less than a minute. Boom.\n\n----------------\nAudio\n----------------\nI did a side-by-side audio comparison of the 2nd and 3rd Generation Echo Dots, first with music (orchestral, a jazz combo, and some AC/DC) and then with a few newscasts. Everything does sound better on the 3rd generation Dot, but to be honest, the sound is still pretty anemic. Compared with the 2nd generation Dot, the sound is slightly fuller, not as annoyingly tinny, and has a small amount of bass presence (not much, but the 2nd generation had none). Newscasts and other spoken texts benefit from the fuller sound as well, but the difference is more pronounced with music. Just for fun, I also compared the 3rd generation Dot with my 2nd generation Echo, and THAT'S where I noticed a big difference. Yes, the new Dot sounds a bit better than its predecessor, but they both sound weak compared to the full-sized Echo. (To its credit, Amazon doesn't claim that the Dot has room-filling sound.)\n\nI'll be blunt: I really like the Dot, but I don't use it to listen to music. At all. With so many other speaker options out there, there's just no reason to use this as your primary music device.\n\n-------------------------\nVoice recognition\n-------------------------\nAs I mentioned above, the number of microphones on the top surface has dropped from seven to four. I'm not sure what the rationale for this was, but after testing the Dot's ability to pick up my voice from different distances and angles, I didn't notice a substantial difference in the overall microphone sensitivity compared to the 2nd generation Dot. Like the other Echo devices, though, it seems to have more difficulty detecting voices that come from below it (which happens if I talk to it while I'm on the floor playing with my daughter).\n\n-------------------\nFunctionality\n-------------------\nThe bottom line is that the overall functionality -- what the 3rd generation Dot \"does\" -- is nearly identical to that of the previous generations (and of other Echo devices, or at least the ones without screens). This is largely because the Alexa assistant software on which all Echos operate is run on Amazon's cloud, not your individual device. This means that as Amazon adds new features and updates to Alexa they automatically become available on all Echo devices. So, you can use any of them to:\n\n- Stream music via WiFi from multiple sources\n- Control smart home devices with your voice\n- Make hands-free calls to other Echo devices or phone numbers in North America\n- Make purchases from your Amazon Prime account\n- Listen to news feeds, podcasts, etc.\n- Do anything else in Alexa's ever-growing skill set, such as make shopping lists, set timers/alarms/reminders, play games, tell you your daily schedule, and any other skills Amazon dreams up for Alexa in the future.\n\nIf you don't want to use the Dot's built-in speaker, you can connect it to your own speakers via Bluetooth or by using the 3.5-mm output jack.\n\nOne new feature for the 3rd generation Dot is a little puzzling to me: You can pair two Echo Dots in a \"stereo mode,\" giving you essentially left and right speakers. I tried this briefly and the results were pretty much what I expected: yes, it's stereo, but it's still weak sound! You can also pair an Echo Sub with the Dots, creating a little 2.1 sound system. Frankly, I'm not sure why you would do this; if I were setting up for stereo sound, I would want speakers that are designed for decent audio performance, not two Echo Dots.\n\nAlexa's skill set is enormous and always growing. In fact, part of the fun of owning an Echo device is seeing what new skills Amazon comes up with (even if many new skills are just silly or entertaining). I'll mention two of my favorite skills here: the Flash Briefing and the drop-in feature. The flash briefing is fully customizable daily digest of news and other information which you can hear any time by asking \"What's my flash briefing?\" There is a huge list of content you can add to your briefing including news updates, weather forecasts, sports and traffic updates, and educational snippets along with many that are just humorous or entertaining. Using the Alexa phone app or your Echo account page you can select exactly what content you want in your briefing and in what order you want to hear it. For example, I configured mine with news feeds from NPR, BBC, and Reuters. I love having an on-demand synopsis of the latest news from my favorite sources.\n\nMy other favorite feature, \"drop in,\" essentially opens a two-way communication channel between any two Echo devices, sort of like an intercom. Simply ask Alexa to \"drop in on [the living room, the kitchen...]\" and you are instantly connected. My wife and I use this feature to communicate from opposite ends of the house. You can turn drop-in capability on or off for each of your Echo devices individually, and you can also choose whether each device can drop in with ANY Echo device or only those in your own home.\n\n[Note that the drop-in feature is NOT the same thing as Alexa's hands-free calling feature. Hands-free calling allows you to call most phone numbers and Echo devices in the U.S., Mexico, and Canada from your Echo by saying your contact's name or number. Just like with a phone call, the other person must choose to answer your call before you can communicate. By contrast, with the drop-in feature communication is instantly established. For this reason you will probably want to use drop-in only with your closest family and friends, and probably only for certain rooms in your home!]\n\n-----------------------------------\nA few (minor) complaints\n-----------------------------------\nUnfortunately this 3rd Generation Dot shares an annoying trait of its predecessors: widely varying volume levels within the daily Flash Briefing. As you listen to the briefing, some components (such as BBC News) come through quietly while others (like Reuters) are much louder. Not a deal-breaker, but slightly annoying.\n\nAlso, occasionally when Alexa misunderstands a command, you have to \"start over,\" which can be really irritating. For example, if Alexa thinks you asked to turn on a light but you really asked something else, she will repeatedly say \"In which room?\" until you say \"Alexa, stop\" and then start over. I'm guessing this type of thing will improve over time as voice recognition software becomes more advanced. This is really more of an Alexa issue than a Dot issue, but it drives me nuts at times.\n\nFinally, I wish the Alexa phone app was easier to use. It works, but its organization is not intuitive and it feels rather clunky to navigate. Again, this is more of an \"Alexa\" issue than a \"Dot\" issue, but still... Hopefully Amazon will continue to make improvements to it!\n\n--------------\nA few tips\n--------------\n1) The Dot seems to pick up voices best when placed at or below eye level (i.e., roughly the level from which your voice emits). Mine has trouble detecting voices coming from below it, so I don't recommend placing this on a high shelf.\n\n2) When you select news feeds for your Flash briefing I recommend picking one U.S. source and one international source (I use NPR and BBC - both are excellent). If you add too many feeds you'll get a lot of overlap and hear the same story several times.\n\n3) If you have multiple Echo devices in your home, sometimes speaking to one will cause others to respond as well, especially if they are in close proximity (like in adjacent rooms). One way to prevent this is to change the wake word of one of the devices to \"Echo\" or \"Amazon.\" The only downside is that you then have to remember which wake word you assigned to each device!\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEcho Dot vs. Echo vs. Echo Plus: Which one to buy?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n(Please note that I am only comparing Echo devices that do NOT have screens.)\n\nWhen choosing between the Echo Dot and one of the larger Echo devices, perhaps the most important question to ask is \"How much do you plan to LISTEN to the device?\" This question is important because one of the biggest differences between the Echo Dot and the larger Echo devices is sound quality: the 1.6\" speaker of the Dot simply cannot match the fullness and heft of the Echo or Echo Plus. (Remember, they all run on the same Alexa software, which means they all have nearly identical skill sets!)\n\nSo, if you don't currently own an Echo device, start by thinking carefully about how you plan to use it. Many Alexa skills fall into one of two broad categories: those that rely heavily on the speaker and those that don't. For example, features that benefit from good sound quality include playing music/newscasts/podcasts, the drop-in feature, and hands-free calling. (This is why I chose an Echo Plus for my kitchen - I use it every morning to listen to the news.) If you plan to use your device largely for these type of features, you would probably appreciate the better sound of the Echo or Echo Plus.\n\nOn the other hand, if plan to use the Echo mainly for \"non-listening\" purposes such as voice-controlling your smart home devices, then the sound quality isn't as important and a Dot is probably all you need. In fact, you could even save some money by purchasing a 2nd generation Dot instead -- especially if it's not going to be in a highly visible location or you don't mind its shiny plastic look. I have several \"single-purpose\" Dots in my house in rooms where I want to voice-control one thing, such as a lamp in the room, and 2nd generations Dots are just fine for this -- and now that their price has gone down they are a great value!\n\n==========\nBottom line\n==========\nThe Echo Dot is an extraordinarily useful and versatile device -- one that becomes more useful all the time as Alexa's skill set expands. The 3rd Generation model has a great new look, but despite marginal improvements in the speaker, it's still pretty unsatisfying as a playback device for music or newscasts. As long as you are willing to accept its acoustic limitations, the Dot can be a wonderful device to have in your home. And if you DO want better sound quality for the features you use most often, you can always connect the Dot to your own sound system via Bluetooth or the 3.5-mm audio jack. Hope this was helpful!"},{"reviewerName":"Ramona Pelham","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"So loud!

Unending entertainment and usefulness.","reviewDate":"October 17, 2018","reviewText":"I had no idea I'd love Alexa so much - I wake up in the morning and she does the routine I've set up, and she's so comforting and useful and fun overall. My husband and I played Skills trivia games for hours last night. If we had kids it would be even more super useful (kids workouts, stories, games) - we even had a goodnight story read to us by Alexa and it was awesome. I'm really loving it. The Echo Dot itself is pretty great - the sound quality is pretty good, the bass when turned up is not that great, but if you really want to rock out you can connect it to other speakers or just use something else instead. I'm really surprised by how much I like the Alexa app (and the Echo Dot), because I'm a little resistant to technology, but it's pretty easy to figure out and feels like a new little buddy in the home. I'm excited to get some SmartHome stuff now so I can turn on/off lights, heat, etc. The only tiny issue I have is that for some reason Alexa doesn't pick up my husband's voice as much as it does mine - maybe because I've used it more?

Meanwhile the google home mini of the same size is VERY loud and crisp. This new version the 3.0...is somewhere in the middle. A little louder but not quite enough. I was hoping to have one in the kitchen and have it play my audio books while i clean/cook, but its still difficult to hear ti clearly over the kitchen activity. No such problem with the google home mini. Also a downside, they changed the charge port to an old fashioned pin style instead of the micro USB. This limits the places I can use it I have a small powered hub in the living room I connect my devices too and I was going to get another one of these for that, but I won't now since I can't connect it easily where I want to. I also used to bring one onto the back patio and have it powered by my Anker usb battery, but I can't do that with this one anymore. Not sure why they suddenly abandoned the micro usb style. It can easily meet the 15 watt demand the 3.0 requires.\nAlso if you need/want a wall mount for this version, you can get one to print on thingiverse.\n\nUPDATE:\nWithin a few minutes of leaving this review I got multiple calls from Amazon asking me to explain my review....not offering to take it back or to exchange it or solve anything for me...but asking me to explain myself. The girl by the end of the call seemed nice enough, but the fact that within a few minutes of a review I got multiple calls on my personal cell asking me to \"explain myself\" seems almost like they're trying to intimidate you away from giving an honest review. Especially since I think I gave all the relevant details in my review. Afterwards I was kind of thinking...is this like a modern \"mafia thing? Are my orders going to arrived busted up or just go missing now?"},{"reviewerName":"Clintre","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Overall improvement, but lost its flexibility","reviewDate":"October 15, 2018","reviewText":"I have 5 Echo Dots (gen 2) and we use them throughout the house for just about everything, being we have a fairly smart home. What I liked about the gen 2 versions, were that they were compact and very flexible on how you could use them. They were easy to mount in different positions and being that they used a fairly standard USB interface for the power, you could really be flexible on how and where you mounted them. The one thing that they really missed on? The well known sound quality.\n\nEnter the Gen 3...\nI really like the improvement in sound. Sure it is not a high quality speaker system, but for the size it is pretty good. Especially when you consider that you can pair them and add a sub for pretty good sound. The look is improved over the gen 2, however it does lose a little bit of the customability that the gen 2 had. With the gen 2, you could purchase different wraps, stands, clock mounts, wall mounts, etc. You could really customize it. The gen 3 is a bit bigger and has a much more rounded shape. While it makes it look better by itself, it lacks the ability to really customize it. It surely would not work as a power socket mount, like you could do with the gen 2, just due to the additional weight.\n\nThat is before you get to the horrendous power cord and adapter. The power adapter is twice as big as the gen 2 and the power cord went away from the, easy to find, usb style cord to a old style input style and it is permanently attached to the power adapter. This is really my biggest complaint as it took away so much flexibility, that you could enjoy with the gen 2. Don't get me wrong, I am sure there will be several new cords and adapters put out to fill the gap, but that is not as easy as using cords many already have. Just makes no sense. Not to mention the cord is really long, so in areas where you want it to be a bit more discreet, this thing sticks out like a sore thumb.\n\nWhat I like...\nSound Quality is a step up\nSound Volume is much improved\nBase look is much improved\n\nWhat I dislike...\nMuch less flexibility on how it is used versus previous version\nNon-standard power cord\nBulky adapter\nUgly long cord"},{"reviewerName":"Marc D.","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Don't rely on it for anything important","reviewDate":"November 2, 2018","reviewText":"I'm forced to use the online Alexa app because I don't own any Apple or Android device and my Windows 10 PC doesn't have the app. I'll list just a few of the problems I've had:\n\n1) It often fails to understand what I say. 2) It often fails to respond to my voice at all, though it's only two or three feet away. It responds to dead silence just as often as to my voice commands. 3) Many commands are not executed. For example, it will not make adjustments to the audio equalizer; it will not give my daily briefing items; it will not play stations saved to my iHeart favorites. 4) There's no product support. I've sent a number of email requests to support and received no response. 5) I had a bunch of recurring reminders set up, and they worked for a couple of days. Suddenly they all vanished. These were important work-related reminders. Of course, there's no way to back them up or save them. So, they're simply gone. 6) The audio quality is poor and sounds muffled no matter what I do. Speech is sometimes unintelligible. 7) Volume is unstable. During some music it will constantly decrease and I have to keep turning it up. Then when an announcer comes on, it's loud enough to take the paint off the walls.\n\nIf I'd paid significant money, I would be returning it. For 99 cents, I can't be bothered. Maybe they will improve it in the future, but for now it serves no purpose; there's nothing it can do reliably.

I've had both and we both know what the echo does so all I'll talk about is the sound quality.\n\nI'm going to get to the chase. This is the BEST speaker I've ever heard for under $50. The functions of the echo along with the music playing functionality and the sound quality makes it a steal at this price point.\n\nThe sound is great for its size. It can get pretty loud but the bass is definitely lacking. The bass isn't god awful but it just isn't there.\n\nNow I will say this... if your primary motivation for a speaker is to listen to music, go with the echo. If it is but your budget is under $50 then go with the dot. It won't blow anyone away during a get together in your living room but it'll get the job done. The dot will only flourish is an enclosed space. It needs walls nearby to bounce off to cover up the weakness of the bass.\n\nIf I had to compare the sound to another speaker, I'd say the UE Wonderboom or the older Beats Pill, all of which suffer from weak bass. For the size, I was impressed by the sound but with the Echo at its refurbished price of $69 I'll have to aim towards that direction.\n\nI'd recommend this for someone who needs an echo for their kitchen, bedroom or bathroom. It's just not going to hold down a living room unfortunately but overall, I like the sound and if I need a second echo, I'll definitely get a dot."},{"reviewerName":"A.

For the price I think the sound quality is fine.\n\nOne problem I note is that the volume steps when using voice volume control (\"Alexa louder,\" \"Alexa softer\") are large around my range of interest.

They’ve included an optional sound (on the app) to let you know when Alexa hears you, but I find the sound to be annoying.\n-There aren’t as many microphones on this unit. Maybe Amazon thought Alexa was too responsive in earlier models, but I prefer the second generation's ability to pick up my voice from across my bedroom without having to raise my voice.\n\n***Pet Peeve***\nI love that Amazon allows the same music to be played on multiple Echos, but why isn’t this feature available for Audible as well.

If they allowed multi-room Audible that would be extremely convenient for those of us who pay for the Amazon owned company…\n\nI prefer the second when it's attached to another speaker simply because the light is brighter and it tends to pick up my voice better. I do own 3 of the third generation echo dots and I am happy with them, but prefer the second (when connected to an external speaker). If you’re using the echo dot as a speaker definitely go with the 3rd generation, because the sound quality is night and day compared to the second."},{"reviewerName":"RCS","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Bad design, IMHO","reviewDate":"October 18, 2018","reviewText":"Very disappointing.

I found both 3rd gens to have a very muddy bass sound on music and the high end sounds frequently were slightly distorted. Alexis' voice was so muffled that her voice was unintelligible at times. I sent the second one back for a refund and bought a second gen echo which is just fine. I think they got the design wrong on this one.

And, frankly, before having the Echo Dots I controlled my lights with Siri on my iPhone and iPad, so it's not like I'm getting much more functionality out of them.\n\nI find the Dot is constantly making mistaking. Examples:\n- I was trying out the music and asked it to play 'old music'. It kept repeating back, \"Great, I'll play Soul Music\", then it would start to play soul music. 5-6 times this happened. And, no, it doesn't apparently understand a negative, such as, \"Alexa, do not play Soul Music,\" because that statement immediately triggers it to say, \"Great, I'll play Soul Music\" and then it starts to play soul music again. (Nothing against Soul Music, it's just not what I wanted.) I never did get what I wanted.\n- I will tell it to play sleep sounds. It will tell me either that I have to download the app, which I have already done or that it can't find the sleep sound that I requested, even if it played the night before. Or worse, it will start to play music related to the sleep sound that I asked for. (I never knew there were so many songs related to rain or trains.) After a half dozen or more tries and screaming, \"Alexa, STOP!\" repeatedly, I am no longer able to even think about sleeping, even if it does finally get it right!\n-I will tell it to turn on the living room light and it will tell me I have to set it up in the app. It IS set up to turn the lights on and off and it has completed this command many times. Although, I am finding this command is gradually getting better, but it's not perfect, yet.\n-I will tell tell it to play an Audible book and it will tell me that I have to buy the book from Amazon, even though I already own the book through Audible.com (an Amazon company) and have played it several times before on that very Dot.\n\nWhat is most annoying is that often I just want to know something basic, like today I wanted to know what date was Thanksgiving Day. Instead of simply telling me the date, it gave me a long history of how the date came about and never did give me the date.\n\nOut of every 10 commands, it is a guarantee that 7-8 commands will have to be repeated, changed, broken down into simpler steps or started over multiple times. I find myself screaming \"Alexa, stop!\" in frustration constantly, as it rambles on incorrectly or plays something incorrectly. (And I am accent-free, with very clear speech.)\n\nNot to mention the apps, of which they tout are so many tens of thousands, are pretty useless. For instance, I had heard I could make a list on it, such as a grocery list or To-Do list. Yeah, I can, but the grocery list is in the Dot and not anyplace useful; it doesn't link to my Grocery app or Things 3 app on my computer or phone, for example. It is buried deep in the Alexa app, which is totally inconvenient. If I want it in my Grocery or Things 3 apps I have to play it back and manually transfer it line by line.\n\nSet-up, which I had read was a breeze, was anything but. I had to contact Amazon customer service, which itself is difficult to find, then it took them a good 40 minutes to help me get the Dot to work.\n\nI am very disappointed in the sound quality, too. It is not good enough to make me want to listen to music through it, at all. I will listen to books, but frankly ear buds have much better sound quality and make the listening a richer experience. When Alexa is playing something, like answering a question or giving a daily brief, the volume goes up and down ridiculously. One statement will blow you off the bed, while the other will be very quiet.\n\nRegarding listening to Audible books, now that is extremely frustrating! I bought 2 Echo Dots, one for the bedroom and one for the living room, specifically so I could listen to Audible books while moving around my apartment. Audible.com is an Amazon company, so you would think that they would integrate the linking of the Dots together for playback. Nope! After talking to Customer Service, I found out that only music can be linked to play back on both Dots simultaneously. Audible.com books can only play back on one Dot or the other at one time. How stupid is that?\n\nI find being more than 5-7 feet away from the Dot makes it very iffy on whether it will correctly hear what I say. How is it helpful if I have to walk to within a few feet of the Dot to ask it turn off the lights, when walking 3 more feet I could turn off the lights by hand? I've put the Dots so many places trying to find the best places for them and decided that I wish it had batteries so I could just carry it around. I guess this is how they get you to buy 20 of them for your apartment.\n\nI thought I would love these, but it's like thinking you are buying powerful motorcycles and getting a couple of tricycles instead. Maybe if I were into trivia and games I would like them more, but I want them to accomplish more important things, not just be toys."},{"reviewerName":"Jazzin Sykes","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Finally a woman that can be controlled!

If the echo dot is placed against a wall and/or under a cabinet (I had mine in the kitchen against the wall and under a cabiinet) the sound becomes more muffled and much of the midrange/treble is lost. On the other hand if you have the Echo Dot more in the open, like on a table and not right next to a wall or solid object, the sound will open up more, become less muffled and provides a better overall sonic experience.\n\nThis is a review of the Echo Dot (3rd Gen) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal.\n\nI have Sonos One speakers, a Sonos Beam and 2-Echo Dot 2nd Generation speakers. I just had to purchase the new 3rd Generation Echo Dot to satisfy my curiosity.\n\nWow, just blown away at the huge difference in sound quality compared to previous Echo Dot Generations. The 3rd Gen Dot has a 1.6\" speaker vs the 1.1\" speaker in the 2nd Generation Dot and it makes a profound difference in sound quality. The sound is richer, more full and has much more bass. It also plays significantly louder. If you are thinking of getting an Echo Dot, considering these improvements, there is little reason to get a 2nd Generation Echo Dot unless the difference in price is that big of an issue. Or perhaps the lack of a micro USB port will keep you away from the 3rd Generation.\n\nI will admit that I am irked that Amazon changed the power from USB powered to having to use the AC adapter that the 3rd Generation now uses. I hate wall warts and now the Echo Dot has one. It's also not nearly as convenient to have to worry about bringing a power adapter with you rather than using any old USB power. But what you give up in that department you more than make up for in sound quality.\n\nI like the appearance of the new Dot. It is more refined and has quite a bit more class. Folks with vision issues will also appreciate the fact that the buttons on the top of the Echo Dot have raised features that you can feel with your fingertips to differentiate between the buttons. Kudos to Amazon for that.\n\nThe Echo Dot 3rd Generation is a big step up in quality over any previous generation of Dot. I would not hesitate to recommend the Echo Dot 3rd Generation if you are late to the party. It sill won't be an audiophiles first choice, but for the low cost this Echo Dot is a winner for the rest of us. In spite of the improved sound, it still has a muffled quality that I notice. So yes, the sound is better than previous Echo Dot generations, but it's still not excellent.\n\nYou can connect to it via WiFi, or Bluetooth and the 3.5mm Aux Out (no cable included) enables you to easily send the sound to a more robust speaker that allows Aux In or to a legacy home stereo system if you desire.\n\nI didn't really need another Echo Dot in my house, but I'm glad I took the chance to check out a 3rd Generation Echo Dot. I'll happily retire one of my older 2nd Generation devices for this one.\n\nThanks to bensound.com for the music used in my demonstration."},{"reviewerName":"Daniel R","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Much better audio quality!","reviewDate":"October 15, 2018","reviewText":"This version of the dot is the first one I would recommend to someone who is interested in a smart speaker but not willing to spend much. The biggest drawback to the previous generation was the sound quality/loudness. I use my echoes mostly for controlling connected devices and listening to podcasts, so I felt like the older echo dot was OK for most things I would require. But even for casual music listening, it wasn't up to snuff. The new one actually has bass and sounds good to me, but it's not going to sound like a Sonos or anything and I'm not an audiophile but I do think this will satisfy the majority of people's expectations for $50. I also have the $100 full size Echo from 2017 and the new echo dot has about 65% of the sound quality and loudness of that model vs the older dot having about 15% of the sound quality of the full size echo.

The sound is indeed significantly better, perhaps almost rivaling my Google Home. They are much louder as well. I would have skipped getting the pair. Pairing them as a pair was pretty simple. They will only both play though if you ask them to play something off a service like Amazon Music or Spotify. I often use one of the sleep sounds Alexa skills at night and figured having a speaker on each side of my bed would create a more enveloping sound. Unfortunately, it only plays out of 1 speaker. Also, if I ask it to play a radio station it will play out of both speakers, but when I use it to wake me up in the morning with that same station it only plays out of one. I hear it's kind of the same deal with the sub. I'm tempted to return one of them since the use as a pair is pretty limited.\n\nI thought maybe I could just use a few Sonos One, but they can't do timed actions like alarms.\n\nEdit: Impressively, I posted this review in the morning and Amazon called to discuss it with me that afternoon to see what feedback I had on the Dots.

The only reason I got one Echo Dot is because there is more support and customization for home automation via IFTTT and the fact it dropped to $24 for BF. However, I used to be a Alexa user. The thing with Alexa is, you're spending more time setting up skills to make it adapt to YOUR lifestyle. Alexa is a bad conversationalist, can't work off continued conversations and has a harder time understanding foreign accents/childrens voices compared to other voice assistants on the market. Skills and customization (like IFTTT) is Alexa's selling-point, but you have to invest a lot of time in skills to make her second nature to your life. The thing I HATE about Alexa and skills is that you have to talk really long phrases like, \"Alexa, open [skill] and play [specific request]\" so for example you have to say, \"Alexa open SLEEP SOUNDS and play Waterfall\" . That is just one example, but you find yourself talking really long commands because skills can't run by themselves. you always have to tell Alexa to open a skill then use the skill, and that gets very very cumbersome when you are supposed to have many skills for your personal customization. Like I said, I ONLY have one in the Living room for IFTTT because the major smart-home-product companies release Alexa commands over Google Home commands. As a personal assistant, she's just too much work.

Yep, I was hooked on Echo! After purchasing my new best friends I upgrading my home to a smart home with a number of Alexa enabled devices, including a Harmony Hub to control my TV and entertainment center. Everything seemed to be running pretty smoothly until sometime in October when I experienced my first \"Sorry, I seem to be having trouble\" message! Initially I thought the problem was with the echo devices until after speaking to an Amazon rep, who actually called me to check to see what types of problems I was having after my original post, I learned that the problem was the wireless router that I was using. The Amazon ripped suggested that because of the number of smart devices I had connected my internet providers default wireless router most likely was unable to handle the bandwidth of all of the devices. He advised me on what wireless router might work best. I ended up ordering a new dual band wireless routers that included a 5 gigahertz and a 2.4 gigahertz transmitter. I connected to wireless router to my modem and initially I was unable to control my smart devices until I realized the smart devices would not work on the 5 gigahertz band so I switched them over to the 2.4 gigahertz van and I was up and running!\n\nSince upgrading my wireless router The Echoes seem to be functioning quite well. There are still a few hiccups, for example when I tell my Echo Show to turn off the screen for some reason now it always asks what device. But when I repeat the same statement \"turn off screen\" it does as instructed and turns off the screen. At first I thought perhaps I was not speaking clearly enough but this literally happens every time I tell it to turn off the screen. Another thing that I've noticed is even though I have the option set to not have to say the Wake word every single time, there are many occasions where I will still have to say the Wake word right after making a request.\n\nAll in all, I'm very pleased with my Echoes. In fact I just bought one for family members who fell in love with it!\n\nI use my echos as a personal assistant, which comes in handy! Having the echo link to my Google account allows me to schedule appointments and meetings and it will send notifications to my cell phone to remind me that I have an appointment for a meeting. In addition to using it to control a number of items in my home I use it adamantly to play music throughout my home.

I am disappointed that Amazon has made this generation worse in what I believe to be an Apple-like attempt to make it harder to let third parties make improvements.\n\nThe Good:\nIt is louder. That's it. The first two generations very seldom had an issue with being loud enough.\n\nThe Bad:\nThe speaker has more bass. This may be good for music, but it makes the voice more difficult to hear.\n\nThe microphone has a much more difficult time hearing me. I frequently have to repeat myself for it to hear the wake word despite being in the same location we've had a dot since Gen 1.\n\nThe wall wort now takes up about three spaces in a power strip. The first two gens fit nicely in one space.\n\nThe USB cable has been replaced as the source of electricity with some odd circular plug that is permanently attached to the wall wort. This means that you can't easily switch the length of the cable. It will be harder for third parties to make things like the two wall mounts I use. I don't think any manufacturer will be able to make a tight L-shaped corner for this plug like the kind that are so plentiful for USB. Not having a USB will also make it more difficult to use in the car. With Amazon coming out with their own car version of Alexa I believe this was done to stop people from using dots in the car and to force them to buy the new device.\n\nThe device is bigger than either of the prior generations. While not huge, the increase in size is noticeable and will make it more difficult to mount or make portable.\n\nThe device is covered with cloth. Amazon thinks this is a plus. I guess some consumers might too. I think it looks like cheap furniture instead of a sleek piece of electronics."},{"reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Garbage!","reviewDate":"October 31, 2018","reviewText":"Alexa is an ass.

For my smart home I chose Amazon as my primary provider. Smart sticks, smart subs/speakers/hubs/cameras/ everything. This device was my first step in making my room smart.\nIf you're looking for a portable speaker/smart device, than I suggest this. It's not a hub, but it's a part of the Echo family.\nPortable speakers (with wifi), calculator, someone to tell your dad jokes too or test your wisdom or wits. Alexa is the voice of the Echo family, and like family, we welcome ours with open arms. The dot can be renamed, (I named mine Echo) she's small enough to go unnoticed, and she's got a loud volume that you'll need to yell over her to be heard.\n\nAlexa is kind of like the middle man of making your home smart. Of course, you'll need a hub eventually for things like a smart sub. But if you have Alexa enabled lights, or electronics for that matter, you'll be able to speak with her directly to operate those. I.E.: Alexa, turn the lights on, Alexa, make the lights purple, etc.\n\nI use my device every day, mostly as a speaker playing music all the time. For individual listening to music, I would recommend volume level 3.5 or 4. For the house party, 6-8, depending on actual volume of the party. For hang outs with guests and family, I suggest volume 1-2 for a subtle music. Alexa is also able to take multiple commands at once, so you can tell her to change the volume, dim the lights while increasing the bass of your songs simultaneously.\n\nAmazon's music library has literally 20,000,000 songs to choose from; and ad free. That's essential to a man who listen's to music every day for hours on end.

Echo Dot, excluding the mic.","reviewDate":"March 9, 2019","reviewText":" Summary:\nThe third generation of the Amazon Echo Dot smart speaker is better in many aspects from the already brilliant Echo Dot 2nd generation. Only one thing really bothered me about it, which is the built-in microphone, which appears to be inferior to the previous model.\n\nSince I already own the Amazon Echo Dot 2nd generation and the Google Home Mini, these are the comparison benchmarks that I can relate to in my review.\n\nThe sound that comes out from the Echo Dot 3rd generation is pleasant to the human ears. It isn't meant to replace a true speaker if you plan to listen to quality audio, but it is adequate for background music in a small space (such as a room).\n\nAs for how it's like compared to my benchmark smart speakers - The 3rd gen's sound is better compared to the Amazon Echo 2nd generation, and in certain aspects, it is better than the Google Home Mini.\n\nIn my opinion, the Google Home Mini offers a more balanced sound and better \"mid\" range, while the Echo Dot 3rd generation has better bass and more impactful \"surround\" sound.\n\nThe 3rd generation Echo Dot is louder than the 2nd generation and the Google Home Mini. While testing the Echo Dot 3rd generation, I've placed the device in one specific room, and the maximum volume level sounded too much for this space (3x4 meters). So though the audio quality sounds great, and there's not that much of a distortion, I prefer not to set the device to its maximum volume level.\n\nWhat I did is to set the 3rd gen to volume level 7, and it is about as equal as the Google Home Min at 100% volume level.\n\nIf the Echo Dot 2nd generation looks like a hockey puck, then the 3rd generation looks like a stylish & sophisticated donut.\n\nIt's larger & heavier compared to the previous model, but it's hard to go wrong which one is the newer model.\nSince the Echo Dot is Amazon's most affordable smart home speaker, it's good that Amazon offers it for about the same price.\n\nI purchased it during Black Friday/Cyber Monday 2018 when it was relatively new, for $23 (as part of a deal that included 3 units for $69). It's not always offered for this price, and Amazon should have the interest to keep the price low, but I still appreciate the fact that Amazon didn't raise the price of the intelligent device compared to the 2nd generation's price.\n\nFor some reason, I never used the Bluetooth capabilities of my 2nd generation Echo Dot and Google Home Mini. In fact, I totally forgot they exist...\n\nThat's why I was glad to \"re-discover\" this so obvious feature is available on the Echo Dot 3rd generation - And it works well with my other devices!\n\nRight from the start, I suspected that the newer model is less responsive. At first, I thought that the increased volume level prevents what I say to be heard. Every time I talk to the device, I test if it can hear my voice – sometimes I whisper, other times I talk while there’s music playing in the background, and I’m quite sure the built-in mic isn’t improved compared to the previous model.\n\nI think the main reason why Alexa misses some of the things I'm saying stems from the fact that the 2nd generation Echo Dot had a 7-microphone array, while the newer model has 4 microphones.\n\nThe 3rd generation Echo Dot is powered using a power adapter. I don't mind the power adapter takes more space compared to the USB cable that energized the previous model, but I guess that as a result of the improvements in the audio/volume/size of the newer model, it consumes more power (15W compared to 9W), than the Echo Dot 2nd generation\n\nOverall, it seems that Amazon understands its customer’s needs and managed to improve the new Echo Dot so it would offer more features & better quality for about the same price range.\n\nPlease note I attached to this review screenshots + a video review I made about my experience with the Amazon Echo Dot 3rd generation.\n\nThe pros:\n- Improved audio quality compared to the previous model.\n- Higher volume level compared to my benchmark device.\n- Stylish design.\n- Price remains attractive.\n- Bluetooth connection.\n\nThe cons:\n- It is less responsive compared to the 2nd generation of the Amazon Echo Dot.\n- Bluetooth connection.\n- The device consumes more energy compared to the 2nd generation.\n\n****\nFAQ :\n****\nIf you have any, please do ask and I will do my best to answer them."},{"reviewerName":"Pedro Luis Alcantara Tejeda","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Solo funciona con energía eléctrica","reviewDate":"October 19, 2018","reviewText":"No funciona bien"},{"reviewerName":"Dave S","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"TREMENDOUS value!

The wake word and device names are more than simple but ECHO can not perform them. Customer service agrees that ECHO should understand simple commands and they double checked my naming convention . Simple simple names that should work.\n\nUpdate:\n\nBack down to 1 star and that’s being generous. Simple commands are not heard and being yelled across the room. I live in a small, 1,100 sq ft home with 3 echo dots. All the dots are placed in an optimum position for the room. This product isn’t even a good voice activated switch. I tell it, “ Echo, turn on Stephens light”. It’s reply “ There are several devices named Stephens light, which one do you want?” It does this over and over and over.

Additionally, Alexa is compatible with Xbox One, but not Sony's PS4 (or switch, but there isn't much you'd be doing there anyways). So unless you own the least appealing of Current Gen gaming hardware, that's a wash.\n\nWhat resulted was Alexa spending an awfully large amount of time informing me she doesn't understand, doesn't have the skill for that, etc. To add insult to injury, she isn't even compatible with Roku TV, so my Roku Smart TV is invisible to her as well.\n\nAt the end of the day, Alexa is impressive hardware with software that feels awfully similar to Apple's own walled-garden.\n\nOh yeah, and I'm trying out Amazon Music Unlimited to pair with my Echo.

I prefer music not to have to much base so I can turn base off in the equalizer settings via the Alexa App and turn Treble and the other sound setting to max and music sounds much better.\n\nI did some testing\n\nUltimate Seashore by enviroments sounds good on the Dot 3rd Gen. You can hear each breaker and the very distant foghorn really good.\n\nThomas Dolby's Blinded Me With Science I use this song to test midrange sound and it sounds good on the dot 3rd gen.\n\nWith this Dot you can hear the music and not require an additional speaker. I will be using this when I'm showering so I can hear the music while the shower is going. If you want though you have the option to add a Bluetooth Speaker or a Wired 35mm Cable Speaker to the Dot 3rd Gen. Amazon has really improved this Echo Dot and it sounds slightly better then the Google Home Mini.\n\nI recommend the Dot 3rd Gen and it's really at a good price of $50 if you don't want to spend a lot on an Echo Smart Speaker.

I had never before been interested in getting an echo as I felt like I’d never use it, but boy was a wrong. Having an echo in your house can really simplify your life. It’s so easy to use too, just downloading the Alexa app on the App Store is all you need. Whenever I go to bed I say “Alexa goodnight ” and she turns my lights off, sets my alarms and turns on my white noise machine. Getting accessories for her to use is relatively inexpensive too if you know where to look. I do not have the money to have a “smart house”, but for $10 at Walmart you can get both smart plugs and smart screw in light bulbs that work with Alexa. She also works with Xbox and is able to turn your tv and console on and off and also start games. In comparison to the google home I have and the Apple HomePod, After testing out what was initially a free add on- I ended up buying 7 more echos for around my house. I’d definitely say it was worth it.\n\nPros:\n- very fun to use\n-simplifies life, entertains friends and guests\n-great for voicing commands\n-Automates your house\n-actually affordable price\n\nCons:\n-music quality (lack of bass mainly due to size)\n- needs accessories to be truly functional\n\nEnd note- if you’re looking for a smart assistant for your home that can control anything and always knows the answer- Look no further. If you’re looking for a high quality speaker...be prepared for a little let down. If you’re really worried about the Bass quality, go with the echo plus."},{"reviewerName":"Barbara","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Very Impressed, very please with sound and size.","reviewDate":"November 7, 2018","reviewText":"I love this product.

Muddy, Flat and Muffled","reviewDate":"December 2, 2018","reviewText":"I watched a video before purchasing the 3rd Gen. The reviewer raved about it's greatly improved sound over the 2nd Gen, which I own. Based on that review I bought the 3rd Gen as part of a package deal with a TP-Link HS105 smart switch.\n\nAfter setting it up I immediately noticed how muddy, flat and muffled the sound is. After a couple of days I was desperate to see if there was anything I could do to improve the sound quality. I found out that the user can adjust the bass, mid-range and treble levels. Plus or minus 6dB is the maximum range. I currently have the bass at -6dB, the mid-range at +3dB and the treble at +6dB. These adjustments helped somewhat but there is no getting around the fact that it still sounds muddy. As one reviewer aptly described it, it sounds like someone put a very thick blanket over it.\n\nHere's my preference in sound quality in order of preference: #1 Google Home Mini, #2 2nd Gen Echo Dot, #3 3rd Gen Echo Dot.\n\nThree stars off for the terrible sound. One star off for the barrel plug to power it."},{"reviewerName":"AmazonCustomer","rating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"One step forward and 3 steps back ... What were they thinking???","reviewDate":"December 29, 2018","reviewText":"New but not really improved.\nPerhaps improved in some areas but definitely worsened in others. The only real improvement is more volume output. The low end sound response (slightly better bass) but this comes with a loss of midrange and higher freq sound quality. So the sound is actually less balanced now. Some refer to this as \"muddy\" sound. (And the Google Mini still sounds better.) The device is slightly larger, heavier, and now has cloth side cover. Aesthetically it looks somewhat better but these attributes take away from the practical utility of the V2 device - small, light, easy to clean, easy to mount, etc.\n\nBut the completely STUPID and INEXCUSABLE change is that they SWITCHED FROM A STANDARD USB POWER SYSTEM TO A NON-STANDARD PIN BASED POWER SUPPLY WITH A LARGE WALL WART WITH A FIXED CORD!!! This was not only unnecessary, but this reduces the utility and flexibility of the device. Now try quickly moving your Dot from room to room, attach it to battery, or stick it in your car. WHY THE CHANGE??? WHAT WERE THEY THINKING???\n\nNo one should purchase any Dot or similar device for it's sound quality. If sound quality is a priority, at a minimum, get a full size Echo ... or better yet, interface the Dot or Echo to a real sound system.\n\nThe V3 may be new but different is not necessarily better. The redesign needlessly lost some of the best qualities of the V2. Overall, the V2 device has much better utility than the V3!!! And the Dot is all about utility.\n\nThe Echo system definitely needs improvement. But the most critical and substantial improvements won't come by making superficial tweaks to the devices. Amazon needs to improve is the overall UX, privacy, security, and sw app UI for the entire Echo eco system. Many these things are not simple features. They require core design philosophy and platform architectural changes. How about something as basic as letting users set a unique activation word."},{"reviewerName":"alim611","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great speaker for Music","reviewDate":"October 18, 2018","reviewText":"I liked the speakers improved quality for Music but for the dialogue it was more clear in the older version.

Amazon made device that is not a true assistant. I cannot make real phone calls. So if you are trying to call some that does not have the Echo, forget it. Go over go Google and buy Google Mini. Not only can you make real phone calls with Google Mini is smarter then Alexa and you can make you can make real calls.\n\nI had a kidney transplant and cannot get up all of the time to reach my phone that is plugged charging only short walk away, so I bought the Echo due to it very misleading advertisement. At first look Echo say you can make calls. Amazon made it so it can only make Alexa/ Amazon App to App calls. That is it. So if need to call my son to bring something or to come by my place to help with my care... he would first have to have and Amazon account and his CELL PHONE number must used when setting the Amazon account (he cannot use his home phone number). So now Amazon has just forced him become an account holder. Dear old dad is unable to to ask Alexa to call Mike, on those days that I am unable to get up or answer call that so ring by the time you get the phone, because you move to slow. Amazon cares more about forcing your contacts to join Amazon then they do about making it a real assistant. But that is not it Echo is stupid. It is not good for looking things up. I hear, \"I don't know that one\" a lot; On the other hand Google Mini is spot on. Amazon had the opportunity to dominate the Home Assistant buy giving it full functionality, but we were not worth it. Amazon get yourselves together.\n\nSo, if you want an expensive light switch buy Echo. If you want an ASSISTANT that can make calls to real phones, home, office, businesses and cell phone and is WAAAAAY Smarter the Echo, go to Google and buy the Google Mini."},{"reviewerName":"Lester McGowan","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Wow! What an upgrade! (Update included about “Clock”)","reviewDate":"November 23, 2018","reviewText":"Update: also bought a Dot 3 with Clock. It’s all the things the regular Dot 3 is, with a digital clock. I was hoping it would be nice for a bedside clock, but not so much. It has a very responsive auto dimming feature- that’s the good. But the level to which it dims is STILL too bright for my bedside. I won’t change the starts for my original review since Amazon thinks this is the same product. But I will say that as a bedside clock, the display only gets 2 STARS ⭐️ ⭐️. There is an opportunity for salvation though. This Dot has a touch response for dismissing alarms. I would like to be able to turn off the display in the app, and then show the clock momentarily with a tap. Make that happen, Amazon, and we’ll be good.\n———————————————————————\nOriginal review:\nDot 3 is a remarkable update to this device. I didn’t expect much, but the sound on this is markedly better than previous incarnations. That said, temper your expectations. This is a small speaker. All things considered, this small puck delivers a well rounded and rich sound. It’s much warmer, considerably louder, and landslides less “tinny”. There will be audiophiles who will put this down, and they should since this is not intended to be the worlds best speaker. But, if you deploy a house-full of these things, you will have a robust all-over speaker system that can do all sorts of things.\nNow I’m forced to consider the fate of my Gen2 Dots.\n\nSide note: the amount of people complaining about this thing is astonishing. I believe most are the type who would complain if their ice water was cold. I have a rather large Echo ecosystem in my home. In the first 30 minutes of setup, I knew this was an upgrade from Dot2. It’s a no brainer. Short of an actual defective product (it happens), I can’t understand where the problem is. Setup was fine- came mostly configured right out of the box. Sound quality is excellent FOR A 1.6” SPEAKER. If you want home automation control, with compatible devices that do not require a hub, this will take you there. If you want stadium rocking sound, you’re an idiot for thinking this was even close. If you want whole home audio at a reasonable adult level, 6 of these would be amazing. All of the connection issues are most likely shitty home networks, and dots on different bands in said shitty networks. Yes, some networks will ‘talk’ across 2.4 ang 5GHz bands - but not all. Depends solely on your equipment/router and settings there in. Some routers, like Spectrum’s Ubee, will not maintain an address lease for long connected devices like these. So it would appear that these need to be frequently restarted to maintain functionality when in fact it is the fault of the router. A nice, cheap TP-Link router (available here, of course) can fix all of that.\nDisclaimer: I work in technology. I’m a manager of network administration. I understand these limitations and my expectations are appropriately calibrated. Honesty, theses are basically fancy tuna cans. What did you think it was gonna sound like? Still the best sounding tuna can I own!"},{"reviewerName":"Heath","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Not as good as I anticipated","reviewDate":"November 12, 2018","reviewText":"I dont like it as much as I thought I would.

My Google Assistant on my phone answered questions that Alexa couldn't over and over. 99% of the time, Alexa doesn't know. There is a delay with Alexa that there isn't with Google. Also, every time it answers, you can't ask it a follow-up question without having to say, \"Alexa\" again, which totally drives me crazy. Google takes follow up questions without you having to say its name again. I tried to make an itinerary, and have Alexa read it back, but it was 5 million times easier to just write it down, because Alexa didn't know what I was talking about 90% of the time, so I wound up having to repeat and say the perfect magic words so she would understand, and each time I had to say \"Alexa\" again. I wound up having a shouting match with her (I suppose I was the only one shouting). Alexa is all hype, but I'd rather use my phone with Google, so I just applied for a refund, and bought a Google Home Mini instead. Do not buy the Echo!!! It will cause you more stress than any benefit. I predict that within a few years, people will get wise and go with Google, and Alexa will disappear, because as soon as people check out Google, they'll want no part of Alexa.

I have to say that the audio for this 3rd-generation Dot just isn't good. It's too resonant in the bass / low midrange, even when those values are minimized using the Alexa app. That app gives you three frequency ranges for adjustment--bass, midrange, and treble--which should be adequate. The problem is that the Dot speaker(s) and the shell of the device itself, naturally overemphasize bass and lower midrange. For my listening (mostly to spoken word, not music), that's not at all good--I need the higher frequencies to come through crisply, and to greatly attentuate the lower frequencies (at which spoken voice sounds muddy, indistinct, and slurred). I'll send this one back and maybe try again when Amazon has done a better job of configuring the shell to null out the inappropriately enhanced ranges."},{"reviewerName":"Steve DeVore","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Cool. Irritating. Not sure I'm keeping it. (updated 1/21/19)","reviewDate":"January 15, 2019","reviewText":"So the Echo Dot (3rd gen) is a pretty slick device. I've only had my pair for two days, but the learning curve is as easy or steep as you'd like to make it. Setting up routines, while relatively simple, can make you want to scream in some cases. You have no way of setting repeat to particular days. Your only options appear to be a single day, every day, weekdays or weekends. I work Sun - Wed. So to get my device to perform the routine the 4 days I need it to do so, I'm required to make 4 of the same routine and apply the dates needed to each one. Also, you set up your routine in the order you'd like to have it done (in my case - greeting, a particular song, news and then weather), but Alexa does it in her own order. (greeting, news, weather and then song) But the most annoying thing she does (and this may very well be a deal breaker for me) is that she talks over the beginning of every song you request. Those of us old enough to remember when AM radio was the only radio can also remember the DJ's talking over the intro and how frustrating it was -and now, still is.\nAs for the performance - I was very surprised at how well the voice recognition works. Lots of background noise, dog barking etc. and I'd say she's been about 90-95% on getting it correct. And she gets better as you use her. The sound out of these little guys ain't bad. You're not going to throw parties with these speakers, but more than adequate for quiet background sounds or music. I have one in the living room and one in my bedroom paired up and they do reasonably well in my 1,000 sqft, home with wood floors. (no carpet to soak up the sound probably helps a bit) I've ordered another one and a sub to place in the living room. That will be good enough for a party, I believe.\nAll in all I am very pleased with the device itself. Just not too happy with the examples above and a few other things. (navigating the app can be tiresome, but I'm sure this will improve with time and tweaking from Amazon) If anyone reading this review knows how to stop her from talking over songs - I'd really appreciate the tip. And judging by my scouring the web for a fix, so would plenty of other people.\nI'm moving forward with making the house a smart home with outlets, bulbs etc. But not sure Alexa will see it through to the end. I really do like the thing, but I can't stand DJ's to begin with and now to have this going on - I'm just not sure. That said, if the talking over intros isn't a thing for you - 4.5 stars easy.\nP.S. - As soon as I got mine up and running, I was immediately reminded of the movie Demon Seed. :)\n\nUpdate: After receiving another Dot, Echo and the Echo Sub - I'm keeping this system. The Sub adds much needed depth and bass. The Echo has been perfect for my bedroom and the 3rd Dot went into the bath. The Multi-Room Music function is awesome and I've learned to just accept her talking over songs considering what I've been able to get Alexa to do in the short time I've had it. Still not a 5, but getting closer. We have a pet iguana (in cold Ohio) and I plan on having Alexa run his lights, heat and humidifier. Alexa is much more reliable than my 16yo daughter when it comes to these things and it allows me to leave the house for extended periods and not worry about the iguana freezing or being burned. I'm installing window AC units in 3 rooms and having Alexa control those and doing away with the central air power hog that is due for replacement. All in all, this system can take over your house for you. Everything from \"Alexa, turn off lamps.\" to controlling the dehumidifier in the basement to who knows what else. I am excited to see just how far I can take my house into the future with this."},{"reviewerName":"Nolan","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Echo Dot 2 vs. 3 Review","reviewDate":"November 18, 2018","reviewText":"SETUP:\nThe setup was fairly easy overall. Upon loading the app you go to:\ndevices - add button - add device - echo - select what kind of echo - choose generation - select device - connect to wifi - connect to bluetooth device (Optional) - you're done.\n\nSo while it seems like a lot the app guides you every step of the way and only takes a few minutes.\n\nUSING ALEXA:\nNothing major software wise as these are pushes out to devices regularly. The only thing I noticed was voice recognition. It was a little better than my echo dot 2nd generation. Usually if I was in another room with my second generation I had to yell. With my 3rd generation I don't have to talk as loud.\n\nAUDIO QUALITY:\nThe audio quality on the dot 3 was better than the dot 2 by far. Now there is still room for improvement but it did get better. Even right off the bat at setup I could tell that the quality was better. It sounds fuller and better base.\n\nDESIGN:\nAs you can tell by the pictures the dot 3 has a new finish. Instead of plastic the dot 3 has fabric in various colors. There is also more color choices than the 2nd generation. I think that new version blends in better with the room. It also looks less hockey puck like. The buttons instead of being on the outer rim are now centered more towards the center. The 4 microphones are just beyond the buttons.\n\nPLUG:\nThe plug for the newer version fits into the wall better than the second version. (See Picture) I didn't like this when Amazon introduced the second version but it's here now.\n\nPRICE:\nThe new echo dot is at the same starting price of $50. The echo dot 2 has been discounted to $40 as of 11/18/18. So now the big question is it worth the price? Should I upgrade? Well in my opinion if you have the second generation you should not upgrade and instead invest in a bluetooth speaker. There is not much difference besides the design and audio quality between dot 2 and 3. The software is the same for both. If you really want better audio quality you should buy a bluetooth speaker and connect it to your echo dot. It's really not worth the $50 just for better audio quality and some nice fabric. However if you are looking to have multiple echo devices in your home then your probably better off getting the newer version.\n\nOverall:\nBoth the echo dot 2 and 3 have their ups and downs. Really if you have another echo dot you don't need to upgrade. However if this is your first echo device or you want multiple echo devices in your home, consider the newer version.\n\nWell hope that helps!"},{"reviewerName":"sean screen","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Waste of money and time","reviewDate":"October 18, 2018","reviewText":"Biggest piece of garbage amazon has ever sold!!!!

Here is mine. I am not interested in a smart home. Not interested in turning on lights with my voice. What I wanted it for was my Fire Stick. Together with my Fire Stick, I can basically control my TV. If I say \"Alexa fire TV home\" it turns my TV on. If I say \"Alexa launch Netflix\" or \"Alexa launch Hulu\", the apps will launch. There is a wide range of things the Dot can do with the apps on my Fire Stick. Many apps. I can ask it to play a particular show. if the show is on Netflix it will play on Netflix, if the show is on Hulu it will play on Hulu. It pretty much knows what to do. I can ask it to pause. And then ask it to play. I can ask it to backup or skip minutes. Which is really great when I step out of the living room for the kitchen & realize I should have paused. The Dot can hear me from the other room. I can ask it to skip episodes or go back episodes. When the credits are playing at the end of the episode, I can tell it to skip to go right to the next. I have spent hours without touching my remote. It could also work my Vizio smart TV, but I decided against it, because the 4K Fire Sticks apps movies & shows look phenomenally better than the smart apps. I have also used it to set alarms. \"Alexa set an alarm for 45 minutes\" while I am cooking or something. It's great. You have access to all the prime music & the Dot Speaker itself is pretty good. I have Amazon unlimited, so I have access to pretty much any music you can imagine. Just ask & she shall play. Good for play music in the background while you're cleaning or something. Every morning I asked what the weather report is & I get a much more detailed report than Google ever did on my phone. If it's going to snow that day I can ask how much snow and she'll tell me. I've actually spent time sitting & asking Alexa questions. She is so knowledgeable, that you could almost have a conversation with her. Lol.

I had received a Gen 2 from a neighbor as a birthday gift. Something I didn't know I needed and I love having Alexa answer questions, give me the news, play music, etc. Now, Gen 2 came with problems since it was a gift. Somehow it stopped working because amazon thought it was stolen (although they never came out and told me that) and it took the neighbor to straighten it out. As a long-time customer of amazon, it was the first time I've ever had problems with amazon.\n\nAnyway, we enjoyed having the dot that I kept in my bedroom since that's where my home office is located. When I saw the Gen 3 on sale, I decided to purchase one. I moved the Gen 2 to the front room where my husband could enjoy music, ask questions, etc.\n\nAt first, the Gen 3 was great. Loved everything about it and it worked fine. Then the speaker started to sound muffled. Alexa sounded like she had a lisp (sorry for those reading this who have lisps). Then the news briefing would give the weather, announce the next story and stop. After talking with support, I sent it back and ordered a replacement, which I was assured would not have the speaker problems or lapse in stopping during news briefings. I received the replacement, set it up, and guess what! Although the speaker seemed ok, the news briefings stopped working. Contacted support and was told it needed an update that would take 3-5 hours! OK. Update took place (in the background so I didn't have to do anything). It started working and all was good with the world (well actually we know not all is good with the world, but all was good with the world of Alexa in our bedroom.\n\nGuess what started happening again? Yep, Alexa will tell the weather then will stop. I go into the other room to hear my news briefing. This morning it didn't work, I tried again just now and it gave me one story after the news (an update). It's just not right and I would not recommend purchasing Gen 3 until amazon gets these bugs straightened out. Gen 2 never had these problems. I guess an updated product is not necessarily a better product.\n\nI said I was not going to call support again, but why should I pay for something that does not work as it should?"},{"reviewerName":"michael alston","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Love it!","reviewDate":"October 15, 2018","reviewText":"Much improvement over the last gen in sound quality.

When setting up the first one, I plugged it in and the blue ring lighted up for a minute and it announced that the setup was complete. I tried a few commands and they total worked. I was a bit spooked, because I did not get to use my Alexa app to set up wifi for the Dot, including typing in my network password, and it just did find the network and got in by itself! More spooking thing was that when I looked at Alexa app on my iPhone, it shows 3 new Echo Dots, all following the naming convention of my other two Echo Dots (2nd Gen) and the Echo (2nd Gen) without me even touching the Alexa app at that point; yet, all of them showing that they are \"offline\", including the one that had already been set up and working to my commands; the information such as time zone was missing, and network information was also missing. It also knows my exact address, instead of just my internet provider's location as in the case for my Echo Dot 2nd Gen and the Echo. I think somehow my order information (with shipping address) got programmed into the Echo Dot 3rd Gen, but the way it \"automatically\" connected to my wifi without password really concerns me - I hope Amazon would see this and provide me with a logical answer.\n\nOn the product itself, I love the Echo Dot 3rd Gen - it looks bigger, cooler, and the sound is much better than that from the 2nd Gen Dot, and even on par with that from the 2nd Gen Echo. I am totally satisfied with the product, but just hope it won't get too smart in certain areas, like the one I mentioned above."},{"reviewerName":"TMK","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Hopefully the Dot 3 is just having growing pains","reviewDate":"November 26, 2018","reviewText":"The good news is the internal speaker is listenable, not bad even considering the size. Compared to the Dot 2 the speaker is light years ahead. Aesthetically, the 3 is 10x more appealing than the 2. It feels substantial, not plastic-y. Microphone-wise, I am not seeing much difference between the 3’s far field 4 mikes and the 2’s seven mikes...call it even. The bad news is, at least for me, the Bluetooth connection to external speakers is (was) waaaaayyyyy buggy. I tried it with a Bose Sound Dock equipped with a Bluetooth 30 pin converter and a regular Bluetooth speaker both of which functioned flawlessly with the Dot 2 right out of the box. The 3 had a terrible Bluetooth connection. So much so that I ended up calling Amazon for help. Annalise was great BTW...we ended up resetting the 3 and that seems to have fixed the issue...but then it made my WiFi smart plug start acting buggy...I fixed that on my lonesome.\n\nOnce you get past the tin-foil hat aspect of having this thing listening to every word, it’s a freaking cool concept and the 3 elevates the sound game exponentially over the 2. For $24 on Prime Alexa sale it’s near the price of a stand alone alarm clock radio and is infinitely more useful. Once the bugs get worked out I think I’ll love this thing. An added bonus is if I say Echo, murder, blood...the cops should be here quicker than a 911 call ;)"},{"reviewerName":"Ron in Florida","rating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"The name's a pain!","reviewDate":"July 15, 2019","reviewText":"Don't get me wrong, the Echo's are truly helpful and enjoyable. We no longer have to write things on lists as we think of them. Just speak and say \"Alexa, add celery (or whatever) to the Shopping List.\" And, we have numerous lists for the farm supply store, builder supply list, club shopping list, and so on. When cooking, or washing clothes, or whatever just say \"Alexa, set a timer for 15 minutes.\" \"Alexa, what time is it?\" \"Alexa, what's the temperature.\" \"Alexa, dining room lamp on.\" The benefits of these abilities are super.\nWhat's not super, is having numerous echos responding either when you're calling on one or having them respond to each time \"Alexa\" is spoken on a computer or television. Just now, I was watching demonstrations on my computer and having to constantly say cancel to the Echo in my study. It's an endless aggravation, and it's one that Amazon could easily correct. BUT, THEY WON'T!\nI have at least six Echos and one Echo Show in my home. All respond to \"Alexa\"! Yes, I could have them reply to Amazon, Computer or Echo, but how long will it take me to learn & remember which I've named which, and why should I have to stop each time to consider the specific name of the one I want to communicate with. If Amazon could get over their pride, vanity or whatever you want to call their proprietary philosophy, they could change the software to allow us to give custom names to each of the devices we've bought and paid for. In my case, the Show in the kitchen would be Kitty, the master bedroom would be Betty, the basement would be Bessie, the front porch (by the rockers) would be Roxie, and so forth.\nYes, we absolutely love having them (and I'm contemplating getting the newest version of the Echo Show as I type), but this inconvenience is sufficient to reduce my 5 star rating by 3 stars.

The SmartThings integration is likewise very good - I can control pretty much everything through Alexa, and the setup was easy and well documented.\n\n“Computer, turn off the living room” and off go the lights, TV and Christmas tree. Brilliant.\n\nThe grouping is excellent - whole home audio is here, and it’s great. (Drawback of stereo feature below also applies here, though.). Just make sure the Dots are in Bluetooth range of each other.\n\nI’m disappointed in the stereo pairing though, and this could be a deal breaker for you. So first, it sounds great, when it works. Amazon and streaming content sound so much better with stereo pairing. Synchronization is perfect, and this really adds to the experience. BUT, it seems you cannot use stereo pairing with a Bluetooth connected audio source. Do you want to use stereo Echo Dots as your Bluetooth computer speakers? Nope. The sound only comes through one Dot, and the Bluetooth connection between dots is severed until you disconnect the Bluetooth audio source. Do you want to stream from a smartphone or tablet via Bluetooth and listen in stereo using 2 Dots? Not gonna work (in stereo) at the time of writing this review.\n\nTo me, this oversight/compromise almost makes it a 3 star device. I am giving it 4 as the whole home audio is quite nice, and Alexa is at the top of digital assistants in my opinion. But the stereo implementation isn’t compete.\n\nOne other negative is latency when used as a speaker for Fire TV 4K. I love my new fire TV 4K. I purchased it in a bundle with the 3rd generation Echo Dot. However, the two barely function together. The audio latency is well over half a second, so the picture is totally out of sync with the audio. Big drawback.\n\nIn summary, use your Echo Dot as a mini smart home assistant. It sounds great, and functions very well as a smart home assistant. The whole home audio feature is great so far. “Computer, play Christmas music downstairs” and it’s an instant winter wonderland in here. But I would not recommend attempting to use this as a Bluetooth speaker for a video device due to the latency issues. Likewise, be aware of the limitations with stereo pairing."},{"reviewerName":"Israel Hernandez","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"The Echo dot is OK for the price, but the Echo is 100X better.","reviewDate":"January 12, 2019","reviewText":"I've been using the Echo dot and the Echo for about 3-weeks now. Everyone talks about the difference in the speakers and sound quality, so I'll leave that out of this review. What I want people to know is that the Echo is much better than the Echo Dot even though the Dot is 1/3 the price. I say this because the Echo Dot has a low-quality microphone. This is probably one of the ways they were able to reduce the price. Consider this:\n\n1. Responsiveness: I have the Dot in my room and the Echo in the living room. More often than not, when I say \"Alexa\" the Echo in the living room will respond while the Dot does nothing. Because of this, I had to change the wake word for my Dot. There are also times where I have to repeatedly try to wake my Dot because it just doesn't hear me. On the other hand, the Echo can hear me while I'm in the bathroom with the door closed.\n\n2. Understanding: A lot of times I'll clearly (and loudly) tell my Dot to do something, but it thinks I said something else. The Echo sometimes does this too, but the Dot does it much more frequently.\n\nI like the Dot overall, but if I could go back in time I would buy another Echo on monthly payments instead. It's just not worth the frustration of having to repeatedly yell at this hockey puck to get it to do something."},{"reviewerName":"Diane","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"This thing is whack - 2nd generation wasn't crazy","reviewDate":"November 29, 2018","reviewText":"Everything I play on this device, now plays on all my other devices.

Response is just as fast as the previous generation when using the wake word. I did notice that the light has a slight delay compared to the 2nd gen when using the wake word but the light has no effect on alexa actually hearing you.

I have a couple of the Gen 2 devices and they work quite well but I wish I didn't have to pair them to a separate speaker to get high quality sound. I use Alexa to control my entertainment system and various lights and switches around the house so I thought adding a couple new models to the home would make 'her' a lot more useful. However after using the new devices a couple weeks, I've found that I don't like them nearly as much. They are louder and the sound has a lot more bass but often normal speech is very muffled. The audio settings in the app for bass and treble don't seem to do anything at all. It sounds exactly the same with the bass all the way down and treble all the way up as it does on the default, middle setting for both. It sounds a lot better for music than the Gen2 but I listen to stations like Comedy Central Radio with the SiriusXM skill and often the comedians just do not sound as clear as they do on the Gen2 devices. Even Alexa's voice itself is affected and very muffled.\nI'm also disappointed with the performance of the Gen3 devices. They seem slower than the Gen2 devices. My Gen2 devices respond quickly but the Gen3 devices always stall a couple seconds before replying. It's possible the Gen3 devices are having issues decoding the voice commands which could be related to my next point..\nThe Gen2 had no issues hearing me most of the time but I find the Gen3 devices misunderstanding commands or more often not hearing me at all and having to yell commands to her even though I'm not far away. Quite often the Gen2 devices in other rooms will respond due to how loud I have to speak addressing the Gen3 right in front of me. It's pretty ridiculous, actually.\nIt's my understanding that the Gen2 devices have a 7 microphone array to hear from every angle but the Gen3 only have 4 mics. I feel this is probably why the devices do not hear as well. I bought two Gen3's and have the same issues on both of them so I don't think it's a anomaly. I feel like the audio controls can be fixed by a software update as I have no idea why the audio sliders in the app have no affect. Perhaps the 'hearing' problem can also be updated by a software patch but until those issues are addressed, I can't give the 3rd gen Dot a good review.\nI've been using the Gen2 devices for about a year and have had very little problems with them. I love what they do and really hoped the Gen3 were going to be a big improvement but they're actually a step down. They sound great when playing music but when I have to yell to get it to play, (and risk one of the Gen2's over hearing and stepping up to the task) it gets a bit irritating.\nI'm not going to return the Gen3's since Amazon was selling them for the same cost as the Gen2's if you bought two. I hope they will fix them with future patches, but I am going to swap them out with the Gen2's and put them in the less trafficked areas of the house for now. I really wanted to like these new Gen3's, but side by side with the Gen2's, I have to stick to the older model which easily gets 4.5 stars.

Quite often I'd forget to start dinner until 7PM, and since I am on a special diet, that meant eating later than optimal. I also take medication several times a day. Add to that how the day can simply get away from me, and I was feeling frustrated with myself! I had no one to blame but myself, but the thing was -- blame wasn't helping! So I got a dot. I started putting in reminders for meds, for starting dinner, for remembering to switch the laundry to the dryer. I got more done, and it helped me not get into negative self-talk/self-recrimination for my forgetfullness. If I had to stop mid-task, I told Alexa to tell me in 5 minutes. I used to really get off track if I went to the bathroom and forgot what I was doing before that. Well, now things flow better. I dont get annoyed with myself, I just fix the reminders! I don't use alarms anymore with their blaring noise -- if you are a forgetful or absent-minded person like me, an alarm is an annoying noise and youo still might not remember what it is FOR. Alexa just tells me. I am also free of the million-zillion post-it notes and the lists that always seemed to be in the wrong room. Alexa keeps all my lists, and can read them to me. I set up Google calendar, let Alexa have access and now she also can remind me what events are coming up --- be that doctors or social events.

Alexa helps me keep things from falling off my radar, and I dont have to use a form of mild shame to motivate myself.\nI wish I had tried it much sooner. My husband was so amazed, he bought the 2nd one for me! He now enjoys having Alexa play sports talk radio and news, and fun stuff like jeapardy questions.

Bought two more cause kids want to listen to music and it's great to be able to reach them in their rooms with my Alexa or thru the app. Nice looking! Nice size! It's especially great if you have prime. The music library is very good. She's pretty good with basic questions. There are some really cool games, apps and fun things to do. I like being able to add past purchases into my Amazon cart just by telling her. I am a writer so it's great to be able to ask for synonyms and definitions.\nCons are..if you like listening to music it isn't great quality. Sounds good enough. But there's no bass and sounds flat. I hear you can send it to Bluetooth speakers but I don't have any. I need to look into those speakers the Dot sits in that supposedly improve sound quality. The sound is just fine for anything other than music. Also, she isn't great with answering questions the way the other companies \"assistants\" do. Basic math she can do. But you can't use her like a calculator. She's not very good with telling you how long a drive will be from point a to point b(which is something I ask often). She is pretty bad at identifying business addresses and phone numbers..specially if they are local. She usually doesn't even get the business right and you sometimes can't stop her once she's spouting wrong info.\nAll in all, it's very cool to have handy.

They were willing to send me a refurbished replacement initially, and now they are hesitating to do that since they are \"afraid\" the next unit will have the same problem. As we continue to speak, I am told they will send me the refurbished unit as long as I understand that there is already an open ticket on this 3rd generation echo dot and the problem may also be found in the new unit. I really hope they figure out the problem because when this dot plays without the distortion the speaker sounds really great! I will try to update this when the refurb arrives.

This is a new product and there is always a risk when purchasing a new device that there may be bugs.\n\nUPDATE:\nThe unit is working a bit better as of late. It isn't always distorted.

All the issues I seem to have, most people have to, by reading the app reviews.\n\nUpdate: July 4th\n\nI continue to believe Alexa is worthless for most people. Here is my latest frustration. I asked for the hours of a particular store. It got the right one the first time. When Alexa asked if I wanted to call, I said Yeah. It does not understand that Yeah as a yes. So I asked Alexa again. However, it started giving me Kentucky and other cities far from my location. I went and looked at what it thought I was saying. The first time, it thought I said \"New Bird\" every other time it understood I was saying \"Newberg\", but used the \"Newburgh\" spelling.\n\nSo now I say \" New Bird\" for \"Newberg\", it recognizes it as \"New Bird\", but will give me \"Newberg\" info.

All in all, this combination made for a minimal investment to try out and see how much we like it before going all in (the dots were on sale 2/$50 at the time). A little backstory--we have a smart TV in our living room and a regular flat screen in my bedroom. Our smart TV isn't really that \"smart\"--it doesn't allow for all of the apps we like to use, so we've always had it set up with a ROKU. Sadly, I broke our ROKU out of pure clumsiness. I was going to just get another one, but the kids had asked about getting Alexa for Christmas--initially I said no, but the more I thought about it, the more I considered the possibilities. See, my best friend has an echo plus, so I was a bit familiar with it already. After some thought, I got to work reading reviews and information online to see what I could learn. I'm already a prime customer, a kindle unlimited, audible and music subscriber as well. Amazon's array of services are just a part of life here--why not try more of the devices offered?\n\nThere are mixed reviews out there about the sound quality of the new 3rd gen echo dots--definitely an improvement over past gens, but still lacking in some way. No, they're not the same as the echo plus, but they're not far behind either. I was pleasantly surprised by the rich sounds coming from such tiny devices.\n\nI'm sure we've barely touched the tip of the iceberg with everything that can be done with these amazing little gadgets, but my favorite feature is the ability to \"drop in\" on other echos around your home. Our place seems to have an odd sound barrier between upstairs and downstairs, so I have to yell pretty loudly to get my kids' attention. With the drop in feature, I can just speak to them in another room in a normal tone of voice. In addition to dropping in, you can also tell Alexa to make an announcement to your entire home, like \"dinner's ready,\" or \"time to go,\" etc. I LOVE that. I'm sure lots of moms could relate to needing something like this!\n\nI also managed to successfully pair our new fire TV stick with our echo dot in the living room, so without touching anything, I can just tell Alexa what I want to watch. We used this feature on Christmas day when we were lazing about watching TV--we asked Alexa to find Christmas movies and were automatically presented with a list of basically every Christmas movie in existence (also included Die Hard--TYVM). The fire TV stick has a voice control feature if you press a button on the remote, but there was just something so neat about not having to touch a thing.\n\nThe music possibilities are endless--it makes me feel a little spoiled. Do you ever think of a song you'd like to hear or add to a playlist on your phone, but your hands are full with something else and then oops it leaves your brain entirely? Any song I want to hear, I just tell Alexa to play. And then I can tell her to add it to a certain playlist if I want. I understand that Alexa works with multiple services such as Spotify, Pandora, etc...I don't know how well those are integrated, but as an Amazon music subscriber, the experience is seamless.\n\nAll in all, I think my next step is to order an additional dot, a fire TV stick for my other TV and most likely an echo plus....maybe a few smart plugs too. I'd like a dot in all major areas of our home for communication purposes and an echo plus in the main living area downstairs for a more room-filling sound quality. Don't get me wrong, these dots sound great, but I'm also aware of how the echo plus sounds, so I would like to have that as well. We are all in with Alexa now. It's a great and fun addition to our home!"},{"reviewerName":"Carsten Langrock","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Echo Dot is great ... just not this version, get the older one","reviewDate":"December 17, 2018","reviewText":"Update 1/4/2019:\nAfter using the new Dot for several weeks, I have to lower the rating by yet another star. The sensitivity of the microphones is pathetic. You essentially have to stand right next to it an shout to have it act upon the voice command. It also takes significantly longer to respond, as if the processor that is being used in this V3 is less powerful than the one in V2. Stay away from the third-generation dot!\n\nOriginal Review:\nIt pains me a bit to say this, but the new version (V3) of the Dot is a complete engineering failure. The three areas that have become significantly worse compared to V2 (which we have two of) are microphone sensitivity, sound quality, and power supply.\n\n- Microphone Sensitivity\nFrom the very beginning, I had the feeling that voice recognition wasn't as good as with the V2. I had replaced our unit in the kitchen with the V3 thinking that it might eliminate the need to connect to an external speaker most of the time when casually listening to music. I noticed that I had to repeat myself more frequently when asking to add items to my shopping list, for example, or that the Dot misunderstood the items that I wanted to add.\nThis morning, I ran a little test to confirm the problem. I placed the two Dots (V2 and V3) next to each other and asked for the time. The old (V2) Dot responded. I then moved the old Dot farther away in increments of 3 feet. In the end, the new Dot didn't start to respond before the old Dot was at 3x the distance between myself and the new Dot. I guess value engineering didn't work out here with the removal of 3 of the 7 microphones that were in the old Dot.\n\n- Sound Quality\nPeople speak about an improved sound quality. It certainly is louder, but extremely muffled even when adjusting the equalizer to reduce the bass to its minimum and cranking up treble and mids. It's fine for music, but voice responses sound like they come from under water. It's shocking how poor the speaker sounds. The V2 version was tinny, no doubt, and some of the firmware updates caused problems, but at least you could understand what Alexa was saying.\n\n- Power Source\nThe V2 used a micro-USB plug. I bet you have a handful of those cables and 5V cellphone chargers sitting around in case the supplied cable or charger gives up the ghost. The new version switched to a proprietary barrel mount and hardwired charger. You'd have to get a replacement from Amazon and will always have to carry that particular charger if you take the unit with you on travels.\n\n- Overall\nGo with the V2 version of the Dot and save yourself the aggravation. If you've never had a Dot before, you may not realize how well this can work from a voice recognition and responsiveness point of view. The new Dot is junk."},{"reviewerName":"tr888","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"As of FEB 3 2019 the voice commands for navigating FireTV are not ready for prime time","reviewDate":"February 3, 2019","reviewText":"I think the device deserves 3 or 4 stars when considered overall, but in terms of its use as a voice-control for FireTV, it is really almost useless.

We've been using these devices for several years in a whole home network and overall really enjoy their 5-star versatility, which this review will not go into. Instead focusing on the 3rd gen Dot's improvements/functionality.\n\nAmazon has the initial setup really dialed in. Unboxed, plugged it in, and it was 100% ready to go in less than 1 minute with me only needing to have the Alexa app on my phone open -- automatically set up Amazon account, WiFi and location information.\n\nAppearance-wise, it's a very significant departure (and upgrade) from prior models. You can instantly visually see it's the latest model and in my opinion the appearance is significantly improved. It really looks sharp with the cloth surround and slightly bowed out grill which I assume has something to do with the larger speaker in this new model. The new appearance is elegant and really makes the first two gens look stark by comparison.\n\nVoice command response (in our unoffical testing) seems to be slightly snappier despite there being 4 microphones versus the 7 of prior generations. Not sure if this is due to improved processing or better microphones or maybe both, but it's slightly better in hearing my wife and kids.\n\nSpeaker sound quality is improved. Granted that it wouldn't be hard to improve on the sound quality of a prior gen Dot, but none of the Dots, including the latest is a very big device, but for it's size the device it sounds good, and the latest gen definitely hits a greater range (more bass notes). When we have all of our Dot/Echo devices playing music sync'd throughout the our home, as a whole home system they sound good.\n\nOverall the 3rd gen isn't such a groundbreaking upgrade that we'd plan on ordering 6 units right now today to replace our perfectly fine functioning previous gen 1&2 Dots, but moving forward the 3rd gen does significantly set itself apart -- both physically and sound-wise, enough so that I likely wouldn't buy a significantly discounted prior gen and all future orders will be gen 3's."},{"reviewerName":"Jessie Campos","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"LOVE IT!","reviewDate":"January 17, 2019","reviewText":"I was pleasantly surprised by just how much this little guy\\girl can do. I have never had any issues with this device recognizing my questions its always accurate and knows exactly what I am asking it. The one issue I have with it is unless you are a techy person you may never use it to its full potential because you may never really pick up on just how the \"Skills\" as Amazon calls them work. Basically you have to download an Alexa app on your phone and then setup the device but from there you have to download skills to really take advantage of this device, an example would be I downloaded a Fios Skill so that I am able to control my cable box with commands such as \"Alexa watch AMC on Fios\" The problem is setting up the skills for this to work I had to enable the Fios TV skill then I had to choose what cable box this device was going to control, well if you never named your cable boxes by the rooms they are in then you have to figure out the name the cable company gave your cable box. Anyways like I said once you get everything figured out its great. I have it tied to my calendar in Outlook, my cable box, my Fire TV, I use it to play music from Amazon \"Apple Music is coming to this device soon\" I ask it what my commute to work is like, what's the Weather today. As far as the Sound quality goes, this small device is perfect for a bedroom or office if you want good sound in a bigger room buy the ECHO or ECHO Plus its that simple. Still some issues in being fully implemented but getting better all the time. Besides updates, Alexa learns from how you use it. Do you NEED it? No. But did we need cars instead of horses?

Getting into the Echo/Alexa experience is a big jump for us older folks who are still trying to figure out our smart phones. This is what I found out the hard way. The Echo Dot is primarily for giving you access to your Echo from another room. So, if you have already put an Echo in your home office and you want to ask Alexa what the weather is when you wake up, you need an Echo Dot in your bedroom. Why should this be a secret? Not knowing that, I bought the Echo Dot as my first Echo device thinking it sounded too good to be true for $30, and it was. After three phone calls to the support dept. about it not connecting, I was told the Dot had to be within 6 feet of the router. This is nuts. I was ready to return it but then I guessed there was something I was missing and I had to find it myself on other websites. If you have a $120 Echo next to the router then you can put an Echo Dot any where you want. Now, I understand but I wish I had known this before buying the Echo Dot. I will probably buy the Echo at a future time, after I save up the money from my fixed income. I've done business with Amazon for many years and this is the first time I felt that I was being led down the wrong path. Seems like the support people could have explained this. The Echo Dot is currently sitting in the office 12 inches away from the router and is working great.

I have loved it and use it many times a day. It was great in our old, fairly small apartment. We just bought a new house with 2 floors and a lot more space. We needed another one for the additional floor. I don't need one for every room. I thought it over, and then seeing the sale price of $24, I decided to get the 3 instead of another 2.\n\nI am so glad I did! I replaced the gen 2 in the living room with the gen 3 and moved the gen 2 to the finished basement. Out of the box, it looks much nicer than the gen 2. The initial setup of the gen 3 took a couple of tries, but was fairly simple. I get better sound recognition from greater distances with the gen 3. For comparison, in the same spot, the gen 2 would have a hard time hearing me from the kitchen sink, in a large open kitchen/living room space. especially if there was other noise, even if I raised my voice. The gen 3 can hear me not only from the kitchen sink, but from down the hall at a bedroom door, without me raising my voice.\n\nThe gen 3 speaker is louder and clearer for basic tasks like timers, adding to lists, and the weather. While the speaker quality is better than the gen 2, I still use it with a Bluetooth speaker for music and when I get her to read my kindle books to me. This is my personal preference.\n\nOver all I like the gen 3 even better than the gen 2, but I wouldn't buy another gen 3 and ditch my 2 all together. The gen 2 still serves a great purpose downstairs, though she won't get as much use as she once did.

The functionality of the two is essentially the same since they are running the same software. However, the sound quality of the 3rd seems reason enough to purchase the more expensive and newer 3rd generation. I also like the appearance of the 3rd generation. The sound quality difference is not bad when Alexa is giving the weather or something like that. However, we use the 3rd generation to play ocean sounds at night for sleeping and that is noticeably different and better with the 3rd generation. I have used the app to group some smart plugs and have enjoyed the convenience. I feel like we will continue to find little uses for the dot that make the morning routine a little easier and it is nice to play a little music while getting ready for work.

This newer version is 90% the same as the original Gen 3 echo dot so I won’t rehash that review again. In short…. This is the SAME as the original gen 3 but this version adds a clock and a few more tweaks related to the clock and display. Here are some highlights below in a nutshell:\n-Same as original Gen 3...but with a very useful clock!\n-Sound is powerful and can be heard across any room. Thanks to the EQ in the Alexa app you can tweak the sound even more.\n-The LED clock is genius! Shows the weather and has adaptive brightness settings.\n-In my opinion the clock is worth an extra $10 for the Echo dot\n-LED time/temperature visible from across the room, even in the daytime.\n\nRoom For Improvement??\n-Sorry...I’m still not feeling this power cord. A USB-C connector would have been perfect! I’d even take a micro usb connector compared to the default cord.\n-Why is the power brick so thick?? My Phone charger has even more power than the Echo power brick at half the size *Head scratch*\n-The sound is definitely an improvement vs the 2nd Gen echo but it feels just a TAD lower compared to the newest google mini (maybe since the mini has front facing speakers)\n\nMy Verdict?

I did not want to spend a lot, but was also hoping to get at least fairly good sound. I had heard the earlier versions of the Dot and was not impressed. But the reviews on this one seem pretty good, so I got it. I can say I am duly impressed. The bass response is a bit lacking, however the sound is clear with a pretty decent frequency response. I work from home and this will definitely sit in my home office for background music. I love that I can easily get things like the current weather and temp just by asking. I am also looking forward to programming some other features to use with the Echo too.\n\nI can also see putting this in a bedroom, or a kitchen, or other secondary room in the house. It is more than loud enough to hear while working in the kitchen. And it would give good enough sound to go to sleep by, then wake up and find out the temp outside before even getting out of bed. I am hoping to program it so I can check on school closings at the same time I get the weather in the morning.\n\nIf you are a very critical audiophile this is not the device for you. But if you just want some good sound akin to a really good clock radio or small portable radio I think you will be more than satisfied.\n\nOh and I LOVE the dad jokes Alexa tells when you ask for a joke!"},{"reviewerName":"sherri","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"My Echo Dot is so amazing!!!!","reviewDate":"December 30, 2018","reviewText":"I don’t know how I ever got by without my Echo Dot. In addition to amazingly simple access to my music library, I use it for just everthing -from my alarm clock to my reminders to my dictionary and my private secretary, weather reports, game scores, amazon order staus, and so much more without having to pickup a device. But my favorite thing about the echo dot is walking through the house, thinking of any song (and artist) that I want to hear, and in 10 seconds it’s playing beautifully on my echo dot without ever touching the device. I am still amazed at the technology even after having it for two years. Am I worried about someone listening in on my Echo, heck no! Just think about it rationally for a few minutes and I think you will agree that its not possible for an Echo Dot to collect, sort, store, analyze and share 20 second snipits of one persons voice data given the trillion pieces of data the all the Echo Dots on the planet generate every minute. I will let the conspiracy theorists worry about that if they have time between planning for the zomby apocalypse and doms day prepping.

So now I am on a list for the Amazon car device that seems to overcome the obstacles the dot has. (This could take years.). I look forward to read that text & reply to take text. Ford Sync support is very short lived.\n\nAmazon in the home: If I play music that is supposedly a part of Prime, Alexa asks me to enable ordering & subscribe to music unlimited. If I play any game other than Jeopardy, Alexa asks me to unlock the rest of the game or categories. This appears to be a by game charge & not an unlock all games. If I inquire about a book, it wants to sell Kindle Unlimited or an Audible book. So it constantly trying to sell me addition purchases in spite of both being subscribed to Prime & Audible.

Hearing him say, \"Alexa, Alexa, Alexa, play baby doo dooo dooo\" or Alexa, Alexa, Alexa play gummy bears\", or \"Alexa, Alexa, Alexa!!! STOP! STOP!\", is just too adorable!!!!!!!! He has to say her name a few times as his speech is still growing. She does pick up that he is calling her after the second or third attempt. ( Not an issue with the adults of course ).\n\nMy reason for purchasing these at first was due to our home size and honestly so fed up of screaming for one end of the room to another to call someone. These have limited this! Enabling me to drop in on my teenager (the main reason for the screaming! ), to advise it is dinner time or any other form of communication. The ability to also alert the entire house with an announcement of, \" We are leaving at 12 PM be ready to go! \", or any other message, \" Dinner will be done at 6 PM, wash your hands and come to the table by then\", again any message at all!\n\nHaving my youngest son this has also made life easier. At times your hands are busy or you are just occupied. Being able to change your sons diaper and realize you are running low and just quickly say, \"Alexa add or order diapers\"! No more 'I forgot moments\". Same principle works in general daily movement in your home. Maybe your cooking and realize you have run out of paper towel, sugar, salt, anything, just add it verbally while still on the go! Not sure about you guys/ladies. Half the time I forget what I was suppose to get and the list goes on until I am completely out of something.\n\nAudible & Music!\n\nWhat can I say my teenager gives it a thumbs up for sure! My 3 year loves it! Again, \"Alexa play....!\", super cute to hear!\n\nMom time! Being able to shut down for the evening with a glass of wine or not! Lay in bed and say Alexa play this book, or play relaxing music. It is not about being lazy! I used to think this about this form of technology! Truly, I would say only people with money need things like this or lazy people. Ha! I was so wrong! Firstly I am not lazy, secondly, I am not rich but not poor either! It is the convenience it adds to your home. Now do I need Alexa to turn on my lights for me? I have not been suckerd in that far as of yet. We will see if I write a review on that product in the future or NOT.\n\nTaking a shower! Needing to wake up! Just shout out, \"Alexa play my wake up station\". In a rush for work, \"Alexa what is the traffic like today\", or \"Alexa what is the weather like today\", so many possibilities.\n\nAs I always say don't over think it! Buy and if you do not like it return it.\n\nAwesome product! Buy the 3 bundle package they offer to save money! You will want one in every room.\n\nMy son CON is that at times you can say Alexa and it will be picked up by another device depending on how close they are, if doors are open, and I guess how loud you are speaking. I believe and not 100% sure you can have the devices react to different workd phrases other than Alexa, but not sure, we have not played around with this function as of yet. Which may eliminate this issue. This CON is not a factor enough to not purchase or continue to purchase them. Each device has a voice command turn off button.

It's my first smart device that's not my phone or TV. I've only had it a short time (about 2 weeks now?) but I've had lots of fun figuring it what I can do with this thing. I don't use it much now already but I'm glad to have it when I need it. It's mostly for music and the speaker sounds nice enough, but having it at full volume sounds pretty bad. Still, it hits a decent volume before the sound quality deteriorates. I'm not gonna complain though for getting it with the promotion, but had I paid full price, I would definitely mark it down some. I have an off brand portable shower speaker that I paid like 15 bucks for that blows it out of the water in terms of sound quality at high volume (plus being portable is a big bonus for the speaker). That being said, it's not going to leave that speaker, the echo has its place in my room and the speaker goes everywhere else. There's a lot I like personally and it by far outweighs my issues I have with it. The biggest one is more of a preference really, and that's the power supply. I wish it was just a USB cable of some kind, not the kinda bulky brick and old school proprietary connector thing.

I have now used products with Alexa in my thermostats and purchased plugs to control other electronic devices such as light in the home. It is very easy to install, and Alexa continues to add skills which makes the product a better value. It even lets you add your Amazon account to purchase products and listen to Amazon music just by talking to it. I am surprised Apple allowed or sat back and let Amazon pass it up significantly with Alexa as in my opinion, Siri doesn't come close, and I am an Apple loyal customer.

That was incorrect. All I had to do was change my vocal command from \"Alexa, two minutes microwave\" to \"Alexa, two minutes ON microwave.\" Of course, I only found that out AFTER I bought two Echo devices as a result of the conversation with Amazon.\n\nBecause Amazon had a $99 deal for Echo and Echo Dot together, I pounced. I didn't realize you needed the same Echo model to use two of them to produce stereo sound. I have two new Echo devices that cannot produce stereo sound together. With that realization, both devices lost value.\n\nMy Amazon Tap -- whose mention the Amazon customer service people found funny for some reason -- has a rechargeable battery and a charging base as well as a micro-USB port in the actual unit. I use it as a portable device throughout my house and outside. Really well-designed, portable and flexible. Both the Echo and Echo dot require a/c power, lowering further the value of both for my purposes.\n\nThe increase in sound quality between the Echo and the Dot is easily worth the price difference. I was dumb to get the Dot.\n\nIn a logical progression of a product that lost utility the longer I owned it, I dropped it, the sound stopped working (the lights responded to my vocal commands and it started the microwave though) and I threw it out. In venting my frustration with a hammer, I learned the unit is sturdy and I could only put a slight hole in it after about 10 hard whacks on a concrete floor.\n\nI feel better now.

Every rep insists on starting over with troubleshooting the network that has previously been cleared of fault and weeks later higher tier support haven't responded. What music you get seems to be pretty random and will change anytime you give it any other command during playback and the advertised \"pizza alarm\" might burn your house down since all alarms & timers seem to be forgotten about 20% of the time, sometimes executing much later but mostly as if never set (even though confirmed when set).

The sound quality is amazing. I can't believe this little thing has such a big sound.\nThe voice recognition is really good too. I rarely have to repeat a command and it recognizes even the most brief command from me. For instance, first thing in the morning I'm groggy and mumble \"Computer, Lana DelRay\" and it plays Lana DelRay easily.\nI call it \"Computer\" because you can change the wake word options on this model.

I'm not sure what they had in mind besides trying to make it more appealing looking and sound better. Yes, it looks more refined than the previous iterations. Sound? There definitely is more bass- but at the expense of treble. You can hear it when Alexa speaks and even after a couple weeks I prefer the voice on the earlier generations. I suppose music is a bit better- and one can argue that you can beam to bluetooth speakers, etc.\n\nGen 3 Dot is heavier than the first two and requires a bulkier power supply. I suppose it draws more power as well. With the earlier versions you could use any 5v charger with enough amperage to drive the Dot. So should the power supply fail it would be more of a challenge to replace. A huge worry? No. But a concern nonetheless.\n\nDon't get me wrong, we love having Alexa in 3 rooms. We've converted most of the switches throughout the house to smart dimmers, have smart bulbs in other areas and smart switches for coffee, tea, cabinet lights. For the most part we think the Alexa concept is genius with so many vendors on board now. I think it's a little pricey for what it is, but I guess Amazon sells millions at this price, so who am I to argue?\n\nBottom line: If you're looking to see what Echo and Alexa are about but unsure, maybe find a refurbished earlier generation.

She initially would say stuff like \"Alexis, this is Esther\" so Alexa would just say \"hmm, I'm not sure about that\" so she would respond \"well I am\".\n\nI figured if nothing else at least it would go through the every morning routine with her even if she couldn't get the hang of asking it things.\n\nThe staff at the assisted living facility found out she had this and they started playing with it. I got a Spotify subscription for it so she could listen to music if she wanted but I figured I'd probably just end up cancelling it since I doubted she would use it. Turns out that's now what she uses it for the most. One of the nurses started asking it to play old Roger Miller songs when she came in to give her pills and my grandma thought that was pretty cool.\n\nNow anytime someone goes to visit her she tells them all about her Alexis. It was probably the best gift we could have gotten her for Christmas lol."},{"reviewerName":"Christine","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"impossible to understand intercom messages and other problems","reviewDate":"January 31, 2019","reviewText":"The echo dot 2nd generation worked perfectly as an intercom using the “drop in” command . The 3rd generation echo dot has the audio going in and out mid sentence making it impossible to understand the echo as an intercom. As time went on the 3rd generation speaker did not get any clearer. Swapping out one 3rd generation for another did not solve the problems with clarity. The 3rd generation has problems when two people are talking more than the 2nd generation. Also music playing on either side of the connection will cause problems with message clarity on the 3rd generation echo dot. The 3rd generation device rather than learning your voice and distinguishing when you talk and subtracting out background noise has the background noise interfere with message clarity. The 2nd generation echo dot does not have as much background noise, music or both people talking at the same time causing the speaker to garble the message as the 3rd generation. The 3rd generation relies on training the user to turn down the music, background noise and to wait patiently while the person on the other end talks. As customers, We expect more from our \"artificial intelligent\" devices.\n\nService was responsive and polite and made overtures to correct any problems. However, promised call backs were not made even though they were scheduled. The service representative did NOT give us a call back number or email to respond or add additional concerns. When additional concerns were raised on the phone, the service representative listened patiently, but did not give us any solutions or answers. Hindsight suggests that perhaps the service representative was more concerned with the low rating of the device than correcting the problem?\n\nOther problems, the turn in policy on the 1st and 2nd generation echo when upgrading to the 3rd generation must be made at the time of purchase and does not reduced bargain pricing such as the buy one get on free deal that was advertised. We are still not clear how the turn in your old to get a discount on the new works, even after talking to the service representative.\n\nThe 3rd generation echo dot appears to be just as dumb as the other echo devices. This means that the ability to answer questions with answers other than \"sorry, i dont understand\" or \"sorry I cannot help you with that\" has not improved. We have both the echo dots which we use primarily as an intercom device, and the ok google device. The ok google device does not appear to work as an intercom or an announcement device, but it answers many more questions with actual practical answers from wikipedia and the irs.gov websites. So other than the intercom and broadcast announcement function, the ok google is the more useful device.\n\nAnother problem we have encountered is that the echo dot devices often disconnect from the WiFi and require reconnection much more often than the ok google device. Unfortunately, these \"artificial intelligence\" digital assistants are not smart enough to reconnect to the WiFi without human help and the use of a phone, tablet or computer based application or program. The process of reconnection is anything but intuitive and is an avoidable nuisance. We as customers expect that our digital assistants should be smart enough to reconnect to the WiFi without human intervention. Artificial Intelligent devices are not very intelligent if they cannot reconnect to the WiFi without human intervention.\n\nAs a customer, we hope that the software upgrades will address these problems. As a loyal Amazon customer and supporter of the echo devices and technology, we expect more from our \"artificial intelligent\" devices. At the very least the devices should become smarter, more useful, and less of a pain in the ass as time goes on. So far our experience has been the opposite, the devices seem a bit dumber, less useful and more of a pain in the ass.\n\nWe purchased a TP-link home mesh system with three channels (the expensive one) because our echo dot version 3 network kept disconnecting. The description of the mesh network device said it was compatible with the Alexa. The devices keep disconnecting and now the drop in function between the home office echo dot 3 and the bedroom echo dot 3 no longer functions even though the echo dot 3 (ED3) in the bedroom can drop in on the ED3 in the home office. Considering the only reason we purchased this system for over $1000 for all equipment was to get a functioning intercom."},{"reviewerName":"Rob","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Almost perfect","reviewDate":"January 27, 2019","reviewText":"The sound quality and volume are SIGNIFICANTLY different from the 2nd gen.

How do birds migrate? etc. We bought an Amazon Echo Dot and a Google Home Mini to compare how they would rise to the challenge. Without doubt, the Amazon Echo is completely unsatisfactory. I gather they have no rights to access google search algorithms and it shows. Question after question is answered with \"Hmmm, I don't know that one\".\n\nIf you are in the mood to spend money, however, it appears that Echo DOT is your device. It will let you buy things with ease. You can also access anything in Prime (music for instance).\n\nThe kids have quickly gravitated to the Google Mini as the \"go to\" device. Alexa may just get returned.\n\nUPDATE: I really tried to make this work. The architecture of the device and the HMI is all wrong from what I wanted. I guess I wanted a personal assistant and Alexa is not that. After scrolling through countless \"skills\" that all seem to just spout useless data, I loaded three that I thought would be useful and helpful; Pandora, Airport Weather, and the skills needed to control switches in the house. Starting with the last, over half of the switches I own already were not recognized by the device. Not that I need to use my voice to control anything. They are all programmed with timers. It's actually easier to open the app on my phone and do what I want rather than go through the vocal gymnastics to get Alexa to understand anything.\n\nPandora seemed to play what it wanted rather than my stations. Very frustrating.\n\nThe Airport Weather skill simply reported it was installed every time I asked for the weather at a local station. My family, in complete frustration, yelled at me to get rid of the thing rather than keep trying to use it over and over and not get what I wanted.\n\nAs for the mini, we plugged it in and asked it to give us information, and while not perfect, it responded more along the lines of what was expected.\n\nI'm updating this to a one-star as I couldn't find a single useful thing to do with this device after spending way too much time looking at \"skills\". It does nothing in a better or more efficient way than that which already do. Perhaps it is a indication of what a data-rich world we live in that a device that supposedly is a source of information and help is nothing more than frustrating noise.

That’s when we experienced one of our, all too frequent (two - three time daily)\nMomentary WiFi signal service drops - from our only one choice, D- rated local internet service provider (which caused ALL our Echo devices to drop offline - and these devices do NOTHING without a WIFI signal. Zip! Moments or hours later when the same WiFi signal was restored, NOTHING we tried could get the Echos to simply reacquire that same unchanged WiFi signal. After a 40minute tech support call to Amazon none of our Echo devices was able to reconnect... and Alexa can’t do ——- without a WiFi signal. Seriously, an Apollo moon launch seemed easier than getting any one of our Echo devices back to tea quite a simple WiFi signal. After 15 minutes w tech support, we had DELETED every Echo device in our house (and deleted all our playlists, preferences and EVERYTHIG else we spent HOURS setting up. Really! I asked after the tech call went past 20 minutes with no results... Reacquiring a dropped out WiFi SHOULD be one simple voice command or button push (if the WiFi signal /credentials hasn’t changed since it was last connected). After working 45 min w tech support we still had no luck on reconnecting ANY Echo device to our lame WiFi (which can drop in and out several times a day) at which point I asked the Amazon agent - do we have to go through this entire procedure EVERY TIME our lame WiFi signal drops out for even a second, to which she replied YES - at which point I told the agent to initiate a return for all of our Echo devices and related home automation devices. They were completely worthless to me with this one GLARING flaw. (And I had all the latest 2nd and 3rd gen High end Echo devices. No one thought to fix the huge flaw in three generations of the product line)? Well maybe I’m the only one who has WiFi that comes and goes.\n\nI love amazon and regularly place orders over $1000 a month just because it’s SO easy to do and always flawlessly fufilled...except the one MAJOR, MAJOR flaw in the whole, otherwise FANTASTIC Echo series of devices. The entire dropped WiFi signal SHOULD be fixed (provided the WiFi credentials haven’t changed) with a simple ALEXA, Reconnect to WiFi voice command or a one button push...and be back online and in business right away without the need of a 45 minute PLUS tech support call.\n\nEcho and Alexa are my favorite home Automation /personal assistant/ direct audio command to buy anything and everything from my beloved Amazon account, but this one flaw RUINED EVERYTHING.

I thought they'd be fun for them to have. They enjoy listening to music and asking Alexa questions.\n\nThe problems arises when we try to use it for the main reason I purchased it: drop in/calling. My children are young and my wife and I work opposite schedules so I really liked the idea of them both having something they can use if they ever need to get in touch with us since they're still too young for cell phones.\n\nThe first day I set up the Echo's they were both working totally fine. They were able to drop in/call and receive as well. But later that night they both stopped working in that way. Everything else worked fine still.\n\nI tried troubleshooting myself for a couple of hours. I'm 35 years old and consider myself advanced with tech, so this wasn't a mysterious contraption I was unfamiliar with. I have all sorts of smart devices, sound systems and AV stuff in my house and I've set it all up myself without trouble. But I couldn't get these to work properly. If I try to use the echo to call someone it just says \"that person isn't in your contacts. An adult can add contacts in the Alexa app\" and won't make the call. No matter who I try. I've reimported the contacts. I've made separate contacts within the Alexa app. I tried factory restoring the Echo's and starting from scratch. Nothing helped.\n\nSo I finally contacted Amazon support. After just about an hour on chat with someone trying various \"fixes\", none of which worked, the support member suddenly said \"Oh, I see you're in the US. This is Amazon support India, we cannot help you. Contact Amazon USA.\" Then the chat stopped. They didn't give me any contact info of who I should be communicating with about it. I'm in SoCal and I got to the chat through the Amazon website so I have no idea why I would've been speaking with the wrong continent for support.\n\nSince then I haven't tried fixing them anymore. In total I spent around 4 hours trying to get them working again to no avail. I haven't contacted Amazon support again because I just don't have anymore time to wast in my life.

I have one in each bedroom to control lights, play music, wake me up, report the weather or news, get notifications on Amazon orders, play games, create calendar events and reminders, set timers, you name it. These are wonderful little devices. There is a phone app that goes with it that allows you do do all sorts of neat things like set up routines that do multiple things. For example, when I say \"Alexa, Good Morning,\" and she turns on the lights, plays the weather, and then turns on my favorite music.\n\nCons:\nAfter I bought three Echos, I discovered that if you have multiple Echos playing Prime Music, you can play the same music to all Echos in a group, but you cannot play different music on each device unless you pay for a family subscription to Prime Music or you set up the Echos to play music from other sources (such as Pandora or Spotify). So if my son and I want to listen to music in our respective room's at the same time, one of us has to use a source other than Prime Music, or we have to pay $10/mo for a family Prime Music subscription. I was a little irked by this discovery.\n\nWishlist:\nI wish that Amazon would not require a monthly subscription to enjoy Prime Music on multiple Echo devices simultaneously.\n\nI wish there was a separate volume setting for the Alexa's voice verses music. Sometimes I want the music at a low volume, but then you can barely hear her when she talks.\n\nI wish there were a few more options for wake words or even a custom wake word.

I purchased the Ecobee4 last year and one of the 1st things I did after installing was turn off Alexa. I didn't want to use it and I didn't want it \"listening in\" on my conversations.\n\nA few months ago, my TV died and I purchased the Fire TV stick to work with a flat screen TV that no one was using. I had a Roku on the older TV and was always frustrated that I couldn't just tell it what I wanted to watch. When I got the Fire TV stick, it was soooooo easy just to say what I wanted without having to go through the online keyboard to type out my message (I always felt like I was typing out morse code or something).\n\nAnyway, I was amazed at how easy the Fire stick was, so I turned on Alexa in the Ecobee. OMG, the first time I used it, my hands were full and I was coming into the house in the evening. I couldn't get to my phone to use the app to turn on the lights. I remembered the Ecobee and had Alexa turn on the lights. WOW, WOW, WOW. I know for some, this may seem like a bit of overkill, but before that night I never realized how easy using Alexa could be. To turn on/off my lights, I would get out my phone, use the app. I would get out my phone, use the app, adjust the thermostat. I did everything from my phone. I know I can say \"Hey Siri\" for my phone to respond without taking the phone out, but Siri has NEVER been able to find my devices or Siri indicates the device aren't responding, very frustrating.\n\nAfter a few days of the Ecobee use, I ordered a Dot!!! I don't know why I resisted this technology for so long. I've had it on my Kindle and never used it. It didn't seem intuitive to use, I felt like I was manufacturing a reason to say \"Alexa\". OMG #2, today I created a grocery list, WHILE I WAS IN THE KITCHEN, without having to find my phone or pencil/paper. I added to that grocery list during the day with just my voice!!! I went to the store and USED THAT SHOPPING LIST and didn't forget anything!!!!! I left the store thinking, Alexa, where have you been all my life :-).\n\nNow, I've purchased a dot for my elderly mom and I got some of the Alexa outlets so she can control the lights, TV, etc. from her device.\n\nI really want the Echo for my car!!! I tried asking Siri to look something up while I was driving and Siri COULDN'T DO IT!!!! The information I Siri provided was incorrect. As a test, when I came home I gave the same instructions to the Echo and was given the correct info!!!! I know Alexa in the car would have been able to provide the correct info!!!!\n\nIf you're on the fence about the usefulness of this device, try it and you'll be convinced it's well worth the purchase. Complementary products seem to integrate smoothly and efficiently with Alexa. I've never had a problem with Alexa finding the lights and Apple doesn't work with Nest or Ecobee. If you're concerned about what Alexa records, I've viewed the recordings and there's was nothing there of concern and if there were, I could delete the information.\n\nBUY THIS DEVICE!!!! :-)"},{"reviewerName":"Adam","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Doesn’t understand simple commands","reviewDate":"July 6, 2019","reviewText":"You tell Alexa “turn off the lights” and she says “I didn’t find a device named lights”. When you say “turn off the lights in the bedroom” she says “there are no devices name lights bedroom”. But if you phrase it differently like “turn on the lights in the bedroom” she suddenly realizes I have Hue, and Lutron hubs and does something. It seems like Alexa should be smart enough to know the room she is assigned to, and without being specific the generic term “lights” should automatically refer to the ones in that same assigned room.\n\nI also use a Logitech Harmony with hub. With the media control specifically, the Alexa and Logitech don’t seem to integrate well with “activities”, so when you want to do something like “Watch Netflix” (which is an activity on my Logitech remote that turns on the TV, Xbox, and the audio amplifier), once again Alexa I gets stupid and claims I have no devices that can do that operation. Instead I must generically say turn on the Xbox (which also turns on the other devices), But doesn’t switch the inputs automatically.\n\nIn general it just feels like she needs to understand more slang, and metaphorical terms... the current implementation is very frustrating to use because you have to memorize specific phrases and talk like a computer."},{"reviewerName":"J.

This one was easier to set up (not that the previous generations were hard...). I have both Gen 1 and Gen 2 Dots but this one is a big improvement because it looks and feels like a better product (pure aesthetics) but in concrete terms it sounds MUCH better than the previous two Dots have sounded. I bought JBL Flip 4's which I have hard-wired to the others in order to get acceptable sound (while still in a small space). They have worked out well and sound great (best BlueTooth speakers I've had), but the 3rd generation sounds fully acceptable (with music) on it's own and I'm not sure I would have bought a JBL to go with it had the others been this good. That, in addition to a more refined \"look & feel\" make this most popular Echo model a clear winner from my point of view. Over the almost 3 years that I've had Echos, they have continually expanded in usefulness. I live alone (am 74) and frankly enjoy having a voice in the house...but she handles music, lights, thermostat, garage door, ordering pizza, reordering Amazon items (previously ordered), etc. So I get a lot of use out of these units in every room in my house that I frequently occupy. The total lack of latency problems in music groups is, frankly, quite amazing to me. Basically, I'm an Apple guy, but the Echo products were first to market and I'm very satisfied with the products and the progress that they've made over these 3 years. Also, I'm very appreciative of the fact that each new version of Echo does NOT obsolete the previous versions...I have the original Echo \"tower\"... it's on the nightstand in my bedroom ... it still sounds great and responds to my every (Alexa specific) command. Don't get me wrong, this is not AI in the purest sense...you really can't hold a conversation with Alexa...but for what she does, I am fully satisfied...and she does a lot...all day long (and into the night)."},{"reviewerName":"Sam S","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Quality look and feel, but spoken word audio quality is not as good as gen 2 units","reviewDate":"December 27, 2018","reviewText":"Received as a gift. Looks really nice and much better than gen 2. However the sound quality for spoken word is not as good. Alexa Sounds muffled, not crisp and clear. Some suggest turning bass down and mid-range and high up. This helps, but not enough. I actually put my old gen 2 in the next room, and I went back and forth asking each unit to tell me the weather, so I could listen to a sentence or two. The new gen 3 unit is not as crisp or clear as the older unit, and is actually difficult to understand at low volumes. The older Gen 2 units sounds great! I think music may sound a bit better on version 3, especially bass, but spoken word sounds muffled. I'm really disappointed since I use it to listen to Audible books and podcasts. I actually thought mine was defective, and I ordered a second unit, but they both sound the same. Very disappointing. I do think the gen 3 unit hears me better and responds more consistently. But to me the poor sound quality of spoken word is enough to cause me not to use it."},{"reviewerName":"S.

I use it to listen to my favorite radio station, either directly or through one of 5 bluetooth speakers I have in different parts of the house. After a couple of weeks I find that it is more work to adjust manually than what it saves with voice commands. First, bluetooth speakers always come on at full volume (which is very loud and annoying) so I have to go to the speaker and turn down volumes manually. Second, every time I want to switch bluetooth speakers I need to turn the app on at my phone and go in & out of 5 windows to select a different speaker. And that's after going to the speaker I want and manually turning it on (I could have old fashioned radios placed around the house and turned them on manually in less time). Third, the Echo Dot does not have a battery so it must be placed against a wall and outlet, rather than in the middle of a room where it would be better able to hear my voice. Fourth, it doesn't always understand what I'm saying even though I speak quite clearly. I played a trivia game a few times and it didn't recognize the correct answers quite a few times.\n\nI understand that Echo will turn electrical devices (such as lights) on or off with a voice command, but that requires purchase of special outlets for each device and I only have one lamp that I regularly turn off & on when I leave or go to bed, and I walk right by that lamp all the time.\n\nThe speaker has quite good sound quality, so I'm happy with that when I want to play anything directly from the Echo."},{"reviewerName":"Tovarizer","rating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Lack of support w/ Echo team. & Pore English","reviewDate":"March 20, 2019","reviewText":"Technical support is basically nonexistent, I’ve called more than a dozen times every single time they put me on hold and or the call dropped for no reason, I have called and tried to find out if there are records that I’ve called and yes, no answer why the long waits .

Some months ago I originally bought a 2nd generation Echo Dot from Amazon (it worked great), but it is has mysteriously gone missing in the meantime, probably got pushed under a sofa accidentally somewhere here in the house. So I bought this 3rd generation Dot a couple of weeks ago. The initial setup was a little clumsy--probably my own fault--but once I completed the setup (calling the device \"David's 2nd Echo Dot\" in the setup procedure carried out using my cellphone's installed Alexa app), it has performed beautifully. The sound out of this little guy is superb; the Alexa app includes an equalizer that actually works quite well. Every day I get music (from Amazon and Pandora), news, reminders, to-do lists, etc., via a simple shout-out to \"Alexa\". There are loads of other Alexa \"skills\" and \"routines\" I still have to check out.\n\nI just received my second 3rd generation Echo Dot today, and its setup went quickly (< 1 minute) and flawlessly without even invoking the cellphone's Alexa app. It registered itself automatically as \"David's 3rd Echo Dot\". Both 3rd generation Echo Dots can run simultaneously, e.g., with two different music sources. I changed the \"Wake Word\" on one of the Dots to \"Amazon\" (the other is the default \"Alexa\") so that the two devices (and I) don't get confused.\n\nI would recommend the Echo Dot without hesitation, and this seller, too. BTW, I have a third Echo Dot on order from Amazon right now, so each of the three (and the original 2nd generation Echo Dot, too, if it ever resurfaces) will soon be set up in separate parts of the house (my wi-fi router blasts out a good-quality signal around the whole place).\n\nSo I am now an Echo Dot junkie. I have no need to get the fancier Echo devices with their visual displays, as all that I ever need in this regard I can get via the cellphone-based Alexa app."},{"reviewerName":"antcin307","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Very good improvements","reviewDate":"January 2, 2019","reviewText":"If you’ve ever owned an echo before and weren’t impressed maybe it’s time to look at the third generation as I did.

Amazons own long list of skills make it almost impossible to purchase something for the smart home that this little device can’t handle. As for smart home the Echo Dot is the beginning and yes the little one can do everything the big ones can. Now for what it doesn’t do well it’s search engine for random questions isn’t google but that’s it, The basics are handled well with the echo it’s the advanced search where you may have a problem. Overall I’ve purchased two and looking to purchase an additional two. Be prepared to enter the world of smart home with this device, bulbs, switches and the accessories to automate your home these items aren’t as expensive as you may think, there will always be something you can buy and not break the bank.\nIf you have a big home with multiple rooms you will need more than two, I could stay with experience maybe more. It has an intercom feature that’s super convenient, it allows us to drop in on another room instead of having to scream through the house for your kids to come to eat.

We've setup daily reminders, one of which is to remind him to set other reminders and it has helped him to remember crucial things, like to eat (he sometimes forgets for hours that his food is in the microwave). While I realize that there could be issues relying on a device it is very helpful for him.\n\nI think the biggest problem with the whole \"Alexa\" enabled category of products is that a lot of people don't realize all it can do and the great potential for special or particular needs.

Once I got it working through the ALEXA APP on my Android phone, went through the short set-up, and started asking it questions (this is the way it learns your voice, BTW), I am EXTREMELY pleased with this device. It is in my kitchen, and I use it every time I'm in there, cooking, washing dishes, putting groceries away, looking up recipes.\n\nSure, you have to add some SKILLS to it, such as games, sounds for alarms/ timers, and other SKILLS / APPS, yet what it can provide in an instant once that is done, is well worth it. Recipes that call for items in metric? Ask ALEXA for the conversion. If you're waiting for something to cook and have to watch it, play \"TWENTY QUESTIONS\" or \"TRUE OR FALSE.\"\n\nThe only slightly amusing issue? If you have more than one ALEXA operating device in the same area -- they both \"hear\" you say the \"on word\" ALEXA and talk at the same time. oops.

I like to keep the volume at 5 on the 3rd gen echo dot, any louder and the sound limitations become more noticeable like the earlier gen dots, but the sound at 5 is perfectly adequate for a smaller room such as a bathroom where you do not want to place a large speaker for a multi-room music setup. For the price of $24 though (black friday), the 3rd gen dot is a steal.\n\nI would give this 5 stars, but I am deducting a star due to the lack of optical out or even coax.\n\nGetting a dot to work with various sound systems that don't have bluetooth has been a chore to say the least, a digital optical out would be nice on future generations for older sound systems that don't have bluetooth or even a special edition dot that has digital out with coax/optical/hdmi.\n\nFor those with a Logitech Z5500, don't bother with an analog to digital converter. There will be a delay with multi-room music and from what I read, converting may decrease the sound quality. Best option I can see is to use a 3.5 stereo male to 3 aux female and use the included analog cable for the Z5500 to get the dot to play on the Logitech on all speakers. I couldn't find any info anywhere about this so troubleshooted it myself and sharing it here to save others the 2 hours I spent googling and searching various amazon products for a solution.\n\nAlso, for stereo connections on other systems, such as an older Bose Solo, make sure you get a 3.5 to 2 cable stereo and not a 1 cord coax cord. The mono cords or 3.5 to coax will not work (I believe because the echo dot outputs to analog and coax is digital)."},{"reviewerName":"Alexander","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Verification Failure!","reviewDate":"December 18, 2018","reviewText":"After Amazon deleted my original post for supposedly cursing- I've cleaned it up a bit- no bad words in the original just didn't like what I said!\n\nOn Dec. 6 2018 right after opening and trying to set it up-\nJust received today and out the box.

The Echo Dot (3rd gen) has definitely surpassed the Google Mini as far as sound goes. The sound from the Dot is louder, fuller and as many reviews have already stated has a much better base. You're still not going to rock the house with this little speaker, but it does sound better for some good background music. You definitely can tell the difference with the orientation of the speakers. While the Mini's speaker faces up, the Dot's speakers face out and as a result tend to fill the space with sound a bit better.\n\nThe look is also much improved and I would say on par with the Google Mini now. I do like the light ring on the Dot better than the Mini's lights on the top which can be hard to see at times.\n\nI thought the Dot's 3.5mm audio jack would end up being a big advantage, but I've learned that I actually prefer Google's approach where I use their Chromecast audio to connect my quality, standalone speakers to my Mini. The reason I like this approach better is that I can locate my good speakers up on a shelf where I wouldn't necessarily want my voice assistant. I want to put my voice assistant a little closer to where I work so I don't have to holler across the room where my good speakers are. But of course, you have to pay $35 extra for that Chromecast Audio. So that 3.5mm jack feature on the Dot will really depend on your situation.\n\nIn the end though...I returned the Echo Dot for one reason. The voice commands are just more natural and seem to work better on the Google Mini. And that's what you end up doing with these speakers...you talk to them, and the more natural that speech is the more the voice assistant just merges into your lifestyle and day-to-day usage. If Alexa was on par with Google Assistant so far as natural speech goes, I'd have to say this Echo Dot (3rd gen) takes the cake, but Google Assistant makes enough of a difference to keep gabbing at my Mini's."},{"reviewerName":"K.","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Connection issues.","reviewDate":"December 29, 2018","reviewText":"Let me preface this with I have three Gen 2 dots and they work perfectly and have for the past year or so.

I contacted amazon and did troubleshooting with no resolution. They sent me two replacements that are doing the same thing. The funny thing is if I listen to my second-generation dots and plus I have no issues with any of my music platforms. It is only the third-generation with the problem; which tells me there is something wrong with this third-generation. I hope they will take this back and return my money. I would rather have a refurbished second-generation than not to be able to listen to all of my music platforms.\n\nThirdly, the echo says it is up to date, BUT the tech support representative stated that the software version is not the latest.\n\nLastly, I have to repeat myself multiple times for this echo to wake up and do what is asked. In my opinion, Amazon had to throw a bunch together to keep up with demand from Prime Days and manufactured a bunch of defective echo dots.\n\nI hardly ever do reviews, but I am so annoyed with this situation that I had to let others know what to expect. This third-generation is not the high-quality Amazon product you have become accustomed. Do yourself a favor and wait until a new generation becomes available or buy an old one."},{"reviewerName":"Tamara Nguyen","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"I know Echo Dot does all kinds of things, but I mostly use it for rain sounds","reviewDate":"March 18, 2019","reviewText":"Echo dot with Alexa does all kinds of cool things. I know. I get the emails every week telling me all the new things up with Alexa! I may get around to trying those things out one day...but mostly I use the Echo dot to play rain sounds while I sleep. It does that awesomely! I have seen my husband use the Echo dot to control our firestick. That was pretty cool. Alexa has answered my little ones questions with some quippy remarks a few times; that was fun. The dot has been pretty helpful in telling me the weather outside before I step out in the cold in my underwear--that's been a lifesaver. I think my next purchase is going to be the Echo dot thing that comes with a screen and reads you recipes. I probably won't know how to use that to its fullest capabilities either, but Amazon is still going to get my money because someone in my household will know what they're doing. 10 out of 10 would buy this again...actually, I did...I just bought the kid version...so, yeah, Amazon strikes again.

Imagine a fat girl running through the house with a flaming hot fan, it panties and a night shirt, chucking a pillar of fire into the snow. I tossed at as far as the Cleveland Browns can throw a foot ball, then I had to pick it up and throw it again so it did not catch the house on fire. Anyways without the noise from the fan to lull me to sleep, I grabbed my Echo and brought it up to my room to play ambient noise for the night.\n\nI never slept so good listening to this thing called brown noise, but then my kitchen felt naked because I had no tunes to clean to. I decided we needed more than one Alexa, we needed an upstairs device and a downstairs device. Enter the echo dot. Yes this little baby solved all my problems. She plays the ambient noise at night, plus I linked her to the downstairs Alexa and can drop in to eavesdrop when hubby is talking on the phone. Unfortunately, neither one of us lead exciting lives and he pretty much just talks to his mom.\nOh, the best thing about the dot, well let me tell you. I have two cats who are jerks. I can tell Alexa to open a box of cats and it will meow away.

I have all set up as a group, \"Everywhere.\" We like to play music throughout the house and with everything connected, it has been great moving throughout the house and being able to hear the same thing. The system runs for 8 hours or more per day. Bought the Gen 3 DOT and it worked quite well, for a couple weeks. At first, it would not start playing a song when all the others were playing, but would cut in a few seconds after the song started. Then, it started just shutting off while the others still played. Finally, after two or three songs, it would say it was having trouble playing the music and would shut down everything. Contacted support, and received a replacement today. Changed out the defective Gen 3 with the new one and all worked well, for a while. However, the replacement now has started to just shut down after a couple hours. Both of the new Gen 3 Dots seem to feel warmer to the touch than the older Gen 2s, so don't know if they are overheating after a couple hours or if there is another problem with them. Thinking seriously about just requesting a refund on the Gen 3 and getting another Gen 2. I do like the sound better on the newer Gen 3, but if it keeps shutting down, .............. Will probably use it for a couple more days and see if the problem recurs or if maybe it was just an anomaly."},{"reviewerName":"Shesinstpete33710","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Awesome little device!!","reviewDate":"December 11, 2018","reviewText":"I'm not a techie by ANY means.

Took a while but after it found and connected to my WiFi I was able to unplug the Dot and move it into another room and she's been chatting away with me ever since.

Very Horse and Buggie.","reviewDate":"February 28, 2019","reviewText":"I am a new first time user. Before making my decision to buy I read several reviews and watched several YouTube videos to educate myself. After receiving it and using it, I think it is over rated. There was nothing easy about the set up of the Alexa app or the Echo Dot. The app took over 30 minutes to download and update. When i plugged the Echo Dot in, Alexa said go the the app and follow the directions. What directions? The app opened and all I saw was the outside temperature and the time. I expected to see a start up screen. I had to find the start up in the menu. The Alexa would not discover and connect to my Wifi even though my phone was connected. The app would just sit and spin and say no internet connection. I was sitting 3 feet away from my modem/router. After trying over and over again I finally had to set it up manually. The same thing with my new Vizio Smart TV. I had to call Vizio technical support and get help with that. The only thing this does with my tv is to turn it on and off. It always comes up with the Amazon Prime and I could care less about that. Now if I want full tv function I have to buy a Firestick. The Alexa app does not recognize Netflix, or YouTube, and many other social media outlets. Very limited.\nI have a new HP laptop with blue tooth and Alexa or my laptop will not discover each other. Trying to get the Alexa app on my laptop is just an endless circle with the app asking for my phone number to send it to my phone.\n\nI don't think the sound quality is all that great so I added a Vivitar Bluetooth speaker. Alexa did discover that and the sound quality is much better. I tried to plug in a set of Logitech speakers, that worked but Alexa then disconnected from the Bluetooth speaker. Very limited in it's capabilities. I live in a 900 sq ft apartment. If I want to use Alexa I have to move the speaker from room to room or buy more speakers.\nAlexa is very Victorian and prudish in her limited answers and almost boring. She has no sense of humor and her jokes are rather juvenile and corny. The developers must be very boring people and limited in creativity. This is nothing but a glorified toy. Alexa grow up. I am an adult and live in the real world. If you don't want to hear swear words or talk about sexuality then put on more filters. Get real. If we can't have open honest conversation with real answers about anything then what is the point?\nMost of the things this does I can do on my phone and more. Setting timers, making lists, searching for trivia, printing documents, searching websites...\nThe is a money pit. If I wanted to turn my apartment into a smart home then I would need a smart hub, smart switches, smart receptacles, smart light bulbs, more speakers, more Echo Dots, etc. This all seams very expensive, limited, archaic and horse and buggy. But is has to start someplace."},{"reviewerName":"Old Alice","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Perfect inexpensive entry into a 'smart house' monitor!","reviewDate":"October 29, 2019","reviewText":"My first Alexa product... wow. I am soooo impressed!\nAlong with most other people, I am also concerned about eavesdropping. So I have installed it into a spare bedroom that we rarely have conversation in. I'm not sure we ever say anything that would bother me terribly to have someone overhear, but that thought still bothers me enough to keep it out of common areas til I'm more comfortable with it.\n\nWhat I marveled at was how you can ask Alexa to make calls from my contact list. I know some people are worried about sharing that info with Alexa, but take a look at how many apps already have access to your contact list, none of which (other than phone and text) enhance your experience. Alexa makes calls for you while lying in bed!!! This feature made me so happy, I bought one for my mom immediately. She has a rescue alert downstairs, but insists on sleeping upstairs, where rescue alert may not hear her. Now, she can tell Alexa to call me from bed if she needs me!! The peace of mind is priceless.\n\nI haven't explored all of Alexa's features, but the ones I like best are the ability to control lights (Alexa lights on, lights off), and the thermostat, while laying in bed. From the guest room, I can turn the ac up simply by telling Alexa to do it, and my husband is none the wiser. HAAAA!!! The ability to make calls or emergency calls while in bed is wonderful! I can have my cell charging on the table, and make calls from Alexa! The sleep assistance skills which include meditation, sounds (forest, waterfall, rain, thunderstorm - all free). Music on demand... Amazon already has my extensive playlist, so I can have it play a pretty large variety already, plus the Prime Music (and if you have Amazon Music, there's literally no limit to what it can play on demand). Let me expand on the meditation.... this actually does a guided meditation that changes daily to help you calm and relax. It's remarkable, and the perfect ending to a hectic day! I LOVE this!\n\nBecause it's in a spare bedroom, I haven't spent a lot of time talking to it for it to get fully used to my voice. I have noticed that when I'm slurring my speech from sleepiness, it doesn't always recognize me, and sometimes when it does, I'm surprised because I know I'm groggy and slurring. I imagine that if I had a cold or flu, the problem would get worse, but perhaps that will improve over time as the recognition grows.\n\nI am definitely glad I got this, and looking forward to exploring all the new features! At this price, I would recommend it to anyone to try (along with a light switch or plug, so you can get instant light turn on off gratification).

It's barely 2 inches tall, yet fills out the room. It gets loouud for my apartment. It is hard to find a preset with good mids these days, but I can hear all the parts nice and clear. The bass isn't that big, but the unit is frikking teeny. Buy a subwoofer you purist. It's also really good at telling me the time and temperature without being bitchy about it. I call it computer.\n\nCons: It weirds out the cats. They arent used to some oddly cheerful voice coming from the corner. We've only had it a week though, time shall tell. The husband has a grumbly voice and doesnt always enunciate so he triggers it at random, and these days, when grumbles set off the wire tap, unease is understandable.

We're still \"learning\" each other but so far, the AskMyBuddy App made this purchase worth it all! The monthly payment plan made it possibly - I could not have paid full price up front, so for that, I thank Amazon immensely. I did purchase a wall mount that I am very pleased with - it's truly portable to be used in any room. Planning on purchasing a second one after this one is paid off. One for the kitchen, one for the bedroom. I live in a 915sq ft apt, so having one at both ends makes more sense.\n\nPROS: Great features. I use the time, temperature/weather/ daily flash news, Amazon music and reminders more than anything else so far. I bought a smart plug for the bedroom light and that works brilliantly. I've played with skills, but she is way smarter than I am. That's a hit to the ego frankly, so I've left it alone after being owned so many times. LOL\n\nI love being able to create my own skills. I've had fun with that! (I had an 8-second .mp4 video of a new skill, but when I tried to upload the vid to this review, it said it could not process the .mp4 file)\n\nHaving compatible security products adds another layer of awesome for this little dot. So many different uses for so many different items makes this Dot a great addition to the home.\n\nCONS:\n1. Smart Plugs are overpriced. I did buy one on a flash sale for $6 - but otherwise, they are $25. WAY too much.\n2. I have a Galaxy S4 phone and the app is not compatible. Having to use my Galaxy Tab A tablet for the App - but since that is reliant only on Wi-fi, I am limited to those parameters to update the app or create a new skill.\n3. Set up was a bear! I use my desktop PC for EVERYTHING. The PC doesn't have wi-fi. Having an old phone didn't help either, and setup was impossible over the tablet because it has no carrier. Had I not had a laptop that I could hard-wire to the router AND that had wi-fi, I could not have set this up. So beware of that. If you have out of date tech stuff - and can't afford to update it, it may prove to be difficult. Borrow a friends laptop that can be hard-wired to the router AND use wifi - you have to go in hardwired then during setup, turn on wifi at the same time. Once it is set up though - it's a well-greased machine!\n4. With it being mounted in the wall mount, the sound range is increased, IMO, but it's bass-y. I've told it to turn the bass down; it's all the way down now and still sounds too deep. Perhaps for Alexa, it's all about that bass! LOL - not a deal breaker, just an observation. To be fair, for a little thing, it packs great sound otherwise.\n------\nOverall, this is a fun tool that is also a life saver when you get the AskMyBuddy app. I paid the extra $3.99 a month to add more contacts, but I'm a senior who lives alone and this app alone, makes it worthwhile for anyone wanting to get their parents that have wi-fi, something fun and useful for any occasion.\n\nI highly recommend a wall mount. I bought the one from \"ProudBird\" on amazon for $9.99 and it keeps the wires neat and out of the way. Just remember though, when you unplug it from the wall, the plug stays and the mount goes - be careful when pulling out of the wall to be mindful of that. Nice pairing of two great products though."},{"reviewerName":"Pinkballoon","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"My new best friend","reviewDate":"August 13, 2019","reviewText":"First of all, I have to say that I’m new to this smart friend.

Amazon is vague with describing what the echo can do because it can do a bunch of stuff. I wrote the harsh review below in anger when it couldn't do the one thing I wanted it to do properly, but then after complaining, Amazon reached out to me to offer help in properly setting up my Echo dot and issuing commands. I still feel that the device is not *quite* as intuitive as they make it out to be. You can also change the activation word from \"Alexa\" to \"Computer\", which makes me feel like I'm in Star Trek.\nIn the end, it's a nice addition to a kitchen, as it can function as an extra cooking timer than can also perform any conversion (1/4 cup = 4 tablespoons), play your second-favorite song when your #1 favorite isn't included with your Amazon Music subscription (computer, play the theme song to 'Quantum Leap'), while also telling you what the wind speed is, and casually look up when Friedrich Nietzsche died for you (August 25, 1900) so you don't have to wonder about it while cooking biscuits. I think the Echo dot can also give you recipe & meal ideas to cook, but I already have a recipe for biscuits and for other meals I simply asked it to schedule a delivery of Soylent instead.\n\nBelow is my original review for context. As I have said, the Echo Dot is a 4/5 star device, would buy again, but it will still make you angry sometimes.\nI BOUGHT THIS SOLELY TO ORDER PIZZA AND IT DOESN’T WORK PROPERLY.\n\n1. Took 45 to set up. That’s 40 minutes too long.\n2. Wanted to use Pizza Hut Skill. When I asked Alexa to “Order a pizza from Pizza Hut.” She replied, “Did you mean ‘Amazon Restaurants’?” I said, “No! Pizza Hut!!” Alexa: “Order from Domino’s” Me: “Pizza Hut!” Alexa: “I see your current address is (address of family member who lives 2,000 miles away).” At no point did Alexa even mention that she was ordering from Pizza Hut or Domino’s or w/e. Not to mention, this was another setback because I had to update my address properly, which you can only do from the stupid 2nd-rate Alexa app (3/5 rating for lackluster U/I input). There were other complications along the way but I was so mad I forgot.\n3. After properly setting up my address, the Pizza Hut skill, blah blah blah. I instruct Alexa to “Order my favorite pizza.” Which is what they advertise you can do. I went to the trouble of setting up the perfect order online on my Pizza Hut account to make this work. I find out that you can’t use coupons with Alexa. So finally, Alexa reads me my order summary - which is $7 more than it should be cause I can’t use a coupon - Alexa says, “Error: you will have to input your order online.” “WHAT THE *fudge*?!? ARE YOU *fooling* SHIPPING ME?!?\nAlexa: “I would prefer not to answer that question.\n\nI added a star because you can ask Alexa to read you the headlines from The Economist."},{"reviewerName":"S.

I had previously purchased an Echo Dot for my parents and also lived with an Echo for a year. I bought this Echo Dot during a deal to see if I'd like it just as much as the Echo.\n\nFor overall functionality, I say it works quite well. It can't answer all of your questions yet, but Alexa is generally knowledgeable about most topics and has many useful features related to personalizing your experience. I especially like the app that allows you to customize questions for any guests in your home that may need help finding things. I've been able to utilize many other features such as lists, morning routine, playing podcasts, playing music, setting timers/reminders, and others. I am planning on purchasing some smart home equipment in the future, but for now I don't know how well the integration works.\n\nAs part of the deal to purchase the Echo, I also got an Amazon Music subscription. Unfortunately, the Echo Dot does not have speakers as nice as the Echo does. If you looked up the differences, this is a known discrepancy so I wasn't too upset. The quality honestly isn't bad enough for anyone who isn't purchasing it for music specifically to be bothered by.\n\nThe other minor annoyance is that the speaker doesn't seem to be 360, as the Echo is, but unidirectional. This isn't a problem for me, currently, as it is set up on a shelf directed towards where I generally am to listen to podcasts, music, and audiobooks. I'm not sure if the microphone is also unidirectional, but I haven't had any problem with Alexa picking up my voice unless I'm in another room around the corner (which is expected).\n\nOverall, I'm happy with my purchase of the Echo Dot. If I decide to add another unit, I will be purchasing the Echo for my main living space, as I do prefer the 360 speaker and increased speaker quality. However, for a budget option or those not too finicky when it comes to speaker quality or direction, the Echo Dot is a great option for a smart home device."},{"reviewerName":"ANDREW PERREAULT","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Disappointed.

I have 4 of these. When I can stay connected to the internet the Echo Dot is pretty awesome. Problem right now is that somewhere between the number of smart plugs I have (quite a few, maybe 10) and the number of echo dots (4) I find myself offline, i.e. NOT connected to the internet. It is ANNOYING to hear the all-to-familiar to me chime, followed by a red halo of light atop Alexa; followed by the also all-to-familiar \"I'm having trouble connecting to the internet. Check the help section of the Alexa app...\" at which time by now I'm yelling for it to shut up before I can unplug it in order to reboot it in an effort to reconnect to the net.\n\nGo to my i-phone to check my network and the scene i the same. That being a constantly spinning icon trying desperately and taking forever at it to establish a connection to the internet. The point here is that as I started to say from the beginning the more devices you have the more internet speed is required. THAT has been my personal experience.\n\nI presently have a download speed of only 20Mb. If all goes well it will be at 4Mb TOMORROW which can't get hee so enough. I will update this review as soon as I can in case you or anyone else following along here and have the same issue. If you only have one Echo Dot and maybe 3Smart Plugs 20 Mb download speed should be sufficient. Finally, so far what I just explained here is not in the Help Section of the Alexa app WHICH incidentally CANNOT be accessed if you're not connected to the internet.\n\nSo if you are for example a brainy type or student focused on something and the room begins to lose its light and in an effort to stay focused say 'Alexa, turn on the light,\" you want the light to come on so you can continue on uninterrupted, right? Good luck with that. My patience have worn so completely thin from instead of a light coming on but instead hearing the chime; the message etc; they tear easily now. GONE.\n\nSo hopefully the faster internet speed will remedy my personal nightmare here. As for the answers to many of the questions asked in the questions section above I'm a little confused because the main issue I have is connectivity issues. As for giving Alexa different name if they are within earshot of each other: every now and then I will say; e.g. \"Alexa, turn on the hallway light,\" and Alexa will answer from the other room the she's having trouble connecting to the internet, while the one in the room in which my request originated will turn on the light.\n\nTo me a lot of all this is pretty intuitive. If you are the type to have found, let's say earlier versions of MS Windows to be very intuitive your problems will be fewer and you will likely recognize the cause of problems within software apps for the Echo Dot. I was a lot happier with this before making my house pretty smart and life more convenient WHICH IT WILL BE ONCE I GET THIS F*ING THING TO STAY ONLINE.\n\nAgain, if you're getting your first one in addition to maybe 3 smart plugs and you have a mere 20Mb download connection you SHOULD be okay and problem free UNTIL you start adding more devices and you most likely will do eventually, little by little or otherwise. But for starters, like I just said you should be fine with just 1 Echo Dot 3 smart plugs and I will say a minimum 20Mb internet connection. Me? Hopefully 40Mb will be enough. If not, then I will have to go with the max available in my area WHICH is not a whole lot more than 50Mb best I remember Soooooo...\n\nGood luck. It's a cool product and once you are up and running smoothly think 2001 Space Odyssey almost 20 years late. Seriously.\n\nWilliam F.

I ordered this because of the new clock feature and better sound (and since it was on sale). I just returned it for a refund.\n\nThe sound quality was much improved -- richer and more bass. The earlier Dot sounded tinny or shrill. This latest one was much more pleasing. This isn't to criticize the earlier Dot (since it wasn't designed as a great speaker), but to compliment this latest version.\n\nThe clock feature is a great new feature. However, when the brightness is set to Auto (or maybe that's called Adaptive), I couldn't adjust the level of this setting. I spent over an hour in an online chat w/ Amazon to resolve this. We did a hardware update, both Android and iOS Alexa application updates. This setting still wouldn't change through either of the apps or by saying \"Alexa, set brightness to 1; set brightness to 10\"). The Dot would briefly show \"1\"\" or \"10\" after sliding the brightness control in the apps or by requesting by voice, but there wasn't any difference in the brightness.\n\nI was able to change the brightness when Auto (Adaptive?) was switched off. So, it could be set to say level \"2\" or whatever, but then it wouldn't adjust based on the room light.\n\nI'd like the brightness to automatically dim in a dark room such as at night; and be brighter during sunlight. And, it seemed to do so, it's just that it was way too dim for me in all these cases. I'd like to bump it up, but couldn't despite that seeming to be a feature. Either Amazon should clarify that this can't be done or fix it.\n\nIf it wasn't for this apparent flaw, I'd give a 5 star rating.\n\nIf anyone has this feature working -- suggesting I just had a bad device -- replies would help others. As for myself, I went back to my 2nd generation Dot and will wait till this is clearly fixed or is a non-issue. My Dot works fine, so I'm in no rush."},{"reviewerName":"Vanessa","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Disappointed and worried about the security issues","reviewDate":"January 15, 2019","reviewText":"I bought these (several) because they were supposed to work with my Sonos to play Apple Music.

Alexa, on the other hand sounds very muffled & chesty. I have treble & mid all the way up & bass all the way down trying to get rid of the tubby/muffled sound of her voice. EQ didn't help. In my opinion, this device should get the voice right first & foremost. I don't expect to play music through it with any fidelity, so it's primary purpose is to talk to me & Amazon got this wrong in their attempt to have it all. Hopefully this can be fixed with their tweaking her voice, or giving us alternative voices that are more intelligible. Disclaimer, I am an audiophile & am used to listening to high quality equipment. My expectations for the Echo Dot's sound quality was low, but I was surprised that the Alexa voice was so bad. I am extremely grateful that they included an audio out though.

Unlike many others, I am using the echo environment in parallel with the Google assistant. The main reason of doing so comes from the compatibility issues and what these devices are programmed to cover. Yes, there are many similarities that you can get from both but if you are really into the smart assistant devices then you realize that the differences are remarkable and I wanted to have everything covered and connected so I am using both (Amazon echo and Google assistant). For obvious reasons, way bigger than what I can even encounter in here, Google is dominating the market when it comes to the speed and ease of use smart assistants and Alexa which is still quite better than Siri, Cortana and Bixby are still way far from Google on the second place. A great example of the differences here is like,when you are talking to an adult person vs you are talking to a kid! So with an adult you can speak freely and expect to get a response most likely than you are talking to a kid. I personally can't blame Amazon for what Google has been dominating solely for years and years ahead of everyone else so if you learned how to speak with this kid (Alexa in here), she is going to get the job done accurately and there's more, as I mentioned on the very beginning. It comes from the area of what one particular device covers and it's that important to get your attention to have the more compatible smart assistant for the tasks or other services you are planning to use. The bottom line here is the third generation of echo dot devices are the best of it's own kind and having them in parallel with Google assistant will do almost everything for what is doable in 2019 technology relm."},{"reviewerName":"BiteSeeing Chicago","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Dot Quality and Stability Not The Same As Echo","reviewDate":"May 8, 2019","reviewText":"I had been wanting to play the same music stream in multiple rooms of our townhouse but didn't really want to invest in another Echo solely for that purpose (it's loud enough to hear the music upstairs). Amazon put the new Dot's on sale earlier this year for $29 so I figured the time was right. The first one I ordered had a ship date of about 30 days from when I placed the order, so I thought the demand was high. I noticed a week later I could place a new order and get one in 2 days, so after talking to support for a while, they canceled the first order and I placed a new order at the discounted price.\n\nThe on-sale Dot arrived and set up as expected. I noticed a lag in response time slowly growing over the course of about two weeks. It also would connect to the external speaker I paired it to, but would never put sound out through it (or itself) after the initial pairing the next time the speaker was turned on. All I needed to do was unplug the device and it started working again. After doing this several times over a few weeks I felt like there was a larger issue so I reached out to support - the website recommended the online chat. That session with Shashi lasted 58 minutes and resulted in a full reset of the Dot and I was told it would resolve the issue but to feel free to reach back out if it happened again.\n\nThe about-every-two-weeks lag continued and I unplugged/replugged it in again and even reset it again but the cycle remained the same until it recently just started throwing a red ring at me and said to try again later.\n\nI again contacted support and after a harrowing recount of the experience, I was told by \"Iris\" the unit was defective and that I'd have to BUY ANOTHER unit. Iris offered me the following consolation (quotes included), \"While this isn't a common issue, Echo is a physical electronic device, and there's always a possibility something can happen. We realize this and offer a 90-day Limited Warranty that covers any defect not caused by physical damage. We also know accidents happen so we have special options available to purchase a new device at a discount.\"\n\nWhile it was nice to have a Dot in another room to localize commands, the spotty performance, inability to maintain a Bluetooth connection to an external speaker, and a sketchy sale followed by a lengthy troubleshooting process that took the unit out of warranty and mandated a second purchase, I'd recommend that you pay full price and log any issues and troubleshooting steps immediately, keeping in mind the 90-day window.\n\nYou are probably better off just getting a more expensive Echo to accomplish the second Alexa goal since they seem to perform flawlessly (in my experience).\n\nBuyer beware!"},{"reviewerName":"Kent Gagon","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"BEYOND DISAPPOINTED","reviewDate":"December 8, 2018","reviewText":"I cannot emphasize enough how much distain I have for Amazon's Alexa.

She’s quick and surprisingly knowledgeable. She has answers for everything and a great trivia knowledge which is fun. I like that you can change the wake word to four predetermined ones (computer is an option for Star Trek fans). If someone in your family is named Alexa you can still use it without it driving you nuts.\n\nIt gets loud enough to hear in other rooms and the amount of automation, which Amazon calls “routines,” is extensive. I have it a set up to lower the volume to 3 (out of 10) at 9pm and raise it back up to 5 at 9am. This keeps our kids from waking us up and we don’t have to constantly change the volume. There are plenty more options if you have other smart lighting even not in the Ring universe. Ex. It can control my IKEA TRÅDFRI smart plugs I use for lighting. All of this without setting it up.\n\nIt is a little creepy to have it always listening to us and it knows a surprising amount about my other accounts (Pandora worked with my account without setup). My wife and I don’t talk about anything work confidential at home but it may bother others if they work from home. There is a physical mute button on the top of the echo dot but it’s only a software switch and not a hardware one.

With that said, this is a review of everything I've noticed of our entire Alexa ecosystem, which includes 2x Echo Dots, 2x Echo Spots, 2x refurbished Echos, and 1x Echo Sub:\n\nPros: Individually, they all work exactly as they should ALMOST all the time (more on that in the cons section). They all look good, and aren't big, ugly hunks of metal and plastic taking up space in your house. They were all incredibly easy to get through initial setup (except the Echo Sub, more below). Music sounds good in all of them, to include the Echo Dots (but it sounds GREAT on the Echos, and fantastic on the Echo/Sub pair).\n\nCons: The voice recognition is almost too good for its own good. We have a fairly open floor plan, with an Echo Spot in the living room and an Echo in the kitchen. Sometimes they both hear a demand, and the wrong device (meaning the one farther away) will respond. I find myself occasionally whispering to an Echo device so its friends don't butt in to the convo.\n\nThe Echo Sub needed to be reset 3x when I first got it/went to set it up. I had to log in/out of the app a couple times as well before it was recognized and would actually pair to an Echo.\n\nSometimes Alexa tells me she can't complete a request, then my wife (who uses Alexa far less often than I do) will ask the same request and it works...and vice versa. We haven't figured out what we're doing/saying or not doing/not saying for these discrepancies to happen, but hopefully that'll work itself out with time.\n\nThe most irritating issue I have so far is getting music to play on the \"Everywhere\" group. Sometimes I say \"Alexa play music everywhere\" and it just doesn't do it. Sometimes it'll play on only some of the devices, and sometimes it'll only play on the device I was speaking to. Our house is two stories, and we have two kids and a dog, so we spend a ridiculous amount of our time cleaning/walking up and down the stairs. A big part of the reason I bought these was for the music to fill the house while cleaning, and it oftentimes requires me to spend some time arguing with Alexa to get that to happen. It's even gotten to the point where I've had to go into the app and manually select \"Everywhere,\" because the voice command just won't work.\n\nIndividual components:\n\n2x Echo Dots (w/ separately purchased wall mounts): No complaints. They setup just fine, and work perfectly. They're actually bigger than I thought they would be, and look a little clunky mounted to the wall, but overall they don't mess up our aesthetic enough for me to dock them a star or anything. 5/5 would recommend.\n\n2x Echo Spots: No complaints again. These were the first two devices we bought, and they worked so well I decided to buy the other devices. My favorite part of these is their ability to pull up security cam footage. My desk is in the basement, so it's nice to say \"Alexa show me the driveway\" and see who just pulled in, or to say \"Alexa show me the front door\" when the doorbell rings. I paired these will some web cam covers (also bought on Amazon, of course) so Jeffy and his crew can't record me all day long.\n\n2x refurbished Echos (in charcoal): I bought these to play music, and they sound amazing. We'll see how they hold up, given that they're refurbished equipment, but I have my fingers crossed. They also look great, and are not an eye sore like other speakers.\n\n1x Echo Sub: The only device that gave me an issue with the setup process. For that, I'd honestly give the Sub 4/5 stars because it really was a pain in the butt getting it properly hooked up. It gave me issues not just connecting to Wifi, but also when pairing with an Echo. Lots of logging in/out of the app, resetting the Sub. Irritating, to say the least. However, with that one star docked, I'd give it a SOLID 4/5 stars. This thing sounds GREAT. I'm a huge music lover, but hip hop/rap is really where my loyalty lies. And I NEED bass when I jam, and this thing delivers bass in spades. Even with the setup issue, I'm planning on buying another for in the basement. If Amazon ever makes a waterproof version, I'll buy one for outside for bbqs/parties too."},{"reviewerName":"Jarod Cornett","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"It's louder, but ... slower?","reviewDate":"November 23, 2018","reviewText":"The 3rd Gen Echo Dot is neat enough. It's considerably louder if you're just using the base unit. I sat it side by side with a 2nd Gen and linked them to play the same song at the same time, and I had to turn the 3rd Gen to Volume 3 to even hear the 2nd Gen. I don't use either of my Dots with their built-in speaker, so that's not really a selling point for me.\n\nThe main problem I have with the 3rd Gen is that it seems to be a little slower to respond to the wake word - sometimes. The delay between \"Alexa\" and the light ring lighting up definitely seems to be slower - but it's a minor note because it doesn't affect the operation of the device. It'll still hear you say whatever you say after the wake word, and I've only had one time where I struggled to get it to listen to me for a moment.\n\nThere was one other issue where it became unresponsive and went into setup mode for no apparent reason. In order to make it work again I had to de-register it in the app and reconnect it. It was odd, and I've never had that happen with a 2nd Gen.\n\nStill, for my purposes (having it connected to external speakers via 3.5mm cable), there's more or less nothing that makes the 3rd Gen any better than the 2nd. The mic seems to work just as well, though I haven't tried talking to it from across my home yet. My 2nd Gen can hear me through a closed door in the next room, so I'd assume the 3rd Gen is even better, but I haven't needed to try that yet. As I said before, the 3rd Gen's volume is greatly increased over the 2nd, so if you don't have yours connected to an external speaker, it would probably be well worth upgrading."},{"reviewerName":"Carin","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Nicer to look at","reviewDate":"November 9, 2018","reviewText":"I have several Dots - this being my 1st 3rd Gen.

There are uses for all the types. We have most of our lighting standardized on TP-Link smart outlets, smart switches, & smart bulbs. In rare occasions the bridge between the two has gone down a few times over the years, and then you are forced to remember how much effort it is to walk over and turn everything on and off yourself versus Alexa doing it all for you :) . Our most convenient use has been the backyard lighting all on smart bulbs to it is just a shout to turn them all on or off because each were on separate light switches in different sides of the house. The point of Dots is so that they are cheap enough to put one in every room, so Alexa will hear and respond from the closest, wherever you may be in your house.\n\nThe Echo Dot itself is great. The 3rd-gen dot is a little bigger than the 2nd gen, is slightly upgraded but functions the same, and fits subtly nearly anywhere. I have one on an outlet mount in a bathroom, which is nice to get the news, or weather, or anything while you get ready for bed or get up in the morning. The speaker itself is just fine. My wife honestly listens to music on it sometimes when it is just more convenient than when she is near a full Echo, and doesn't mind. It is better than the speaker on my smart phone. You can pair it with a Bluetooth speaker or headphones, which I find most convenient for my portable dot that I have on top of a portable battery for it. That's what I use for toting into the garage or backyard to work on stuff. Inside, I usually have an Echo or Show nearby that I use when I really want great sounding music.\n\nFYI: We have 4 Echos (original), 2 Echo Shows (original), 1 Echo Spot , 6 Echo Dots (2nd-gen) + 3 more not in current use displaced by our Echo Shows & Spot, these 3 Echo Dots (3rd-gen), 1 ecobee SmartThermostat with Voice Control (with 9 room sensors) + 1 ecobee4 with Alexa that it replaced, 1 Fire TV with Voice Remote, 1 Echo Auto, 1 Garmin Speak, and 1 smart watch with Alexa as default -- all of which listen and respond as a smart speaker.

The pros are the small size, the attractive appearance, the ability to use the devices as intercoms between rooms, and in general the fun of finding out all the useful things you can do with the device. I like Alexa for setting a timer, or two, serving as an alarm clock, giving me all kinds of reminders to do tasks and take my medicine, she does a bang up job making grocery and shopping lists and sending them. to my smartphone, helping us cook by doing all kinds of recipe conversions, acting as a calculator, playing music of the type you like, telling you the weather and forecast, telling you the time, looking up word definitions, it’s really a lot of fun to use.. My husband built a little robot and works on getting them to talk to each other with hilarious results. I keep finding items in my amazon shopping cart Alexa put there because Little Bot told her to. , There was a refrigerator in there yesterday, I must be careful when I check out! I have enjoyed playing games like Jeopardy with her.. I am sure there are many more things Alexa can do that I have not hit on yet, but when in doubt if she can do something I give it a try. . A couple things that could be better. Alexa can’t deal with the “past” if it’s more than a few seconds later.. I can’t ask her to tell me say, what time she reminded me to take my medicine...She can’t do repeated reminders unless they are in a calendar. Sometimes playing a game I cannot understand her voice, and she cannot understand mine. So I might give the correct answer in Jeopardy but it was not heard correctly. Music in the kitchen, like oldies or rock sounds fine,but when I had her play a sleep story at night, the sound was slightly distorted. I would rather listen to,it from my iPad. Sometimes it gets confusing trying to tell her to stop a timer or add things to the grocery list. You have to remember the right way to ask. Sometimes she shuts off really fast, and I think I am talking to her from the next room, but she’s already off. We have not had our devices long, so I imagine there is a lot more to learn.. We know she is “spying” on us, but generally it is not a concern. We can always just shut her off. I am peeved that every time you play Jeopardy , she tries to sell you hints!

When reviewers said the Echo Dot 3rd gen had better sound I should have known better. The echo 3 might have shifted its frequencies to the lower end compared to the weak tea Echo-2, but the price of more bass was clarity. The midtones and lows are muddy and in my opinion less favorable to listen to than the 2nd gen echo dots. As for stereo pairing, at first it was nice waking up to having two Echo Dot 3rd gens in stereo 40 inches apart placed on my bed Head Board. But then they kept slipping out of synch. Then you have two roque echos basically doing what they want, making random selections and the sound going up and down and in and out. So you have to re-synch or unplug one, which is what I did. Another disappointment is the Echo Subwoofer. Ughh ! I will just have to wait until Amazon takes High Fidelity and Stereo-phonics seriously."},{"reviewerName":"Wills944","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Still a way to go..","reviewDate":"August 8, 2019","reviewText":"Update 10-6-19.. I have really come to strongly dislike the Alexa platform, from skills that do not work or are programmed by juvinlies that babble for ever, to the updates and annoyances.\nMoved to a new apartment this week and put everything back in the corresponding rooms.. Apparently the Dots and android app updated because now upon entering a room with a Echo and saying \"turn on the lights\", all the bloody thing says is \"Can't find a device called Lights\"... and its not just one Dot, its all of them.. I then went back to the app to check the group settings.. None of the Dots were assigned to Groups, nor could any of the dots be assigned to a group! I deleted groups, reset the echo's..just about anything I could think of.. NONE of them could be assigned to a group/room..\nIt was easy to get to link up with the Sonoff/Itead switches in use throughout the house.. Set up was near flawless..\nThe CONS...\nNoisy environments or a few friends talkin... the Echos generally require us to ask people to be quiet so that a command can be issued.. even conversations in another room will cause a Sorry I don't understand that..\nSkills.. Tried the Pizza Hut skill.. it just drops.. a few other skills do let ya stop the interaction, instead its an endless loop of annoying Do you want to enable..whatever... the only way out is to unplug the bloody things..\nLocation within the house.. I asked the echo's what room they were in, (prior to the assignments being undone after an update).. it just says \"I am here\" one would think they'd have it respond accordingly...\nCommands: There is a setting to tell Alexa to wait for other questions after one is posed but as for commands each separate command must be singular.. For instance, once all my devices were setup and put into their respective \"rooms\" telling Alexa to turn on that room turns on ALL those devices.. There are a few that don't need to be on, like the consoles, wax warmers and a few other items.. One could program scenes and/or routines but that isn't the point.. We should be able to say \"Alexa, turn off XXX AND turn on XXC\"\nThe Alexa App... requires the Amazon Shopping App.. but if the shopping app is removed then Alexa will not start AND keep spying in the background. The combined apps are a HUGE drain on battery life.. My phone fell to about 5 hours when the apps were installed..\nWhile mobile browsers and PC browsers are all using html5 and other technology [apps included].. Amazon has taken another page from the big \"G's\" playbook and deliberately limited the ability to manage the Alexa devices and other functions from a PC.. They want those apps on our phones.\nCensoring: I had asked what a Spanish word meant, and it replied \"I'd rather not answer that\".. Now I knew it was a bit of a naughty word.. however I do expect a proper translation/answer to ANY query thrown at the device.. I do not appreciate Amazon taking on a Nanny cap and limiting my access to future requests.\nOverall the Dots are a bit of fun and some convenience... but the ever so slight manipulation that prevent me from using the PC to manage my home automation through Alexa platform is BIG Frown for me.."},{"reviewerName":"Amy","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Very helpful device!","reviewDate":"July 16, 2019","reviewText":"We have been using our new Dot for a few weeks. Overall, it is awesome. We love the HUGE number of skills that are available to use with it. So far, favorites are the flash briefing, lists, trivia skills, reminders...just to name a few. We use ours in the kitchen, as it is sort of the central hub of our home, and so far it’s been great. One thing to note, once you get one of these, if you love it, you’re probably going to want a few of them for different locations if your house, as it doesn’t pick up your voice that great from another room (unless you yell).\nThis device makes my life so much easier with making grocery lists, as I can just tell it what to add as I’m going through my day and I realize we need something. I create different lists for the different places we go (grocery, Target, etc.) and it’s so nice to just ask Alexa to add items as I think of them. I do wish you could add multiple items at one time...if there’s a way to do this, I haven’t figured it out yet.\nAlso, really love the timer; big help with cooking, as you don’t have to stop and wash your hands to set a timer.\nI really love the reminders! These have been a great help, from daily reminders to take my vitamins to things that I don’t want to forget in the upcoming days or weeks.\nI love that I can play music on it while making dinner. The sound quality is great, in my opinion. Our children get a kick out of Alexa saying grace before meals with us too.\nIt’s also super convenient if you want to reorder something from amazon too.\nA few of the things that could be improved on are Alexa’s pronunciation of certain words; sometimes with the vocabulary skills I’ve enabled, she’s hard to understand. Sometimes she doesn’t hear you when you call her name. And sometimes the way you need to ask something in order for her to give an answer is a bit annoying. She relies heavily on Wikipedia for things as well, which is not the greatest. It would be awesome if she used a search engine like google, although I understand why it can’t.\nOverall, we like it and enjoy finding new things to use it for to make day to day life easier. If you are into technology and want something to assist you, this would likely be right up your alley."},{"reviewerName":"Danielle","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Good deal.","reviewDate":"August 25, 2019","reviewText":"Definitely plays music well, as long as you aren't too worried about amazing sound quality. For the size of the speaker, it's prettty awesome.\n\nAlexa is very helpful, we use her to set timers for TV/Computer time limits, cooking. I have a reminder to take my vitamins set in, which is excellent since I am always forgetting. Every day she helps me remember things. We have a grocery list set up, so I can add items to the grocery list as I use them, which helps us keep from running out of essentials. If I see something is low, like the peanut butter, I simply say 'Alexa, add peanut butter to grocery list' and it's there. If I have already added, she lets me know and asks if I need to add it again. You can access the lists in real time from the app on your cell phone, so if my husband stops on his way home from work, he can see everything we need right in the store, and check it off the list as he picks it up.\n\nAs long as you don't mind the marketing that comes along with being listened to constantly, it's great. (Husband and I discussed getting oil for our new house in the kitchen and immediately after I had an ad for an oil company on Instagram. Could have also been our phones. Hard to tell what is triggering these events anymore nowadays.)\n\nWe also got one for the kids to have in their playroom and they love it. I know there are more features that I can access for them. I just have to find a good description of what they are.\n\nOne drawback is that you can only link one music service account (that I can tell). Amazon music will only play on one speaker at a time for me, so if the kids ask for a song downstairs, my music stops upstairs. We have gotten around this (upstairs adults) by listening to another app, like iHeartRadio's generic radio stations (since you can't log in and customize likes/stations to multiple music services that I can tell), or TuneIn will play public radio by asking for the program automatically."},{"reviewerName":"Ghost","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Amazon needs to add a few things.","reviewDate":"July 14, 2019","reviewText":"I had the Google mini and Google wifi but I do a lot of shopping at Amazon, and I have an Amazon music subscription so it made sense to get one of these. I have a dot and the bigger echo 2nd gen.\nSet up is easy and Alexa immediately recognizes my smart plugs and switches. Integration with smart devices and smart homes works really well. Alexa has some issues tho. She has problems understanding things sometimes. Google rarely has issues but Alexa has them more often than not. She sometimes has a problem understanding what is said. I can go to Google and say the same thing and boom, no problem. I'm a DJ so I speak very well and that's not the issue at all. That can be fixed in time I'm sure tho. Not a deal breaker.\nThe sound... As a DJ I have to say this speaker sounds good for its size. I think Google mini sounds better but not much better. They recently updated a software issue which would distort the sound when played over level 6 for 10 minutes or more and it sounds much better now at higher volumes.\nThe things they need to add.\n1) Alexa really needs some voice options! Google mini has about 6 and they added John Legend. I think if Amazon could add Jarvis from the Avengers-IronMan then Alexa would be a huge hit! Not being able to change voices definitely hurts Alexa.\n2) Alexa needs to be able to call anyone even 911.\n3) Its my device, if I want to call it mini me I should be able to do so. Let us name the devices wake word. It really shouldn't be that hard to do. I would even pay money to be able to do that.\nThose aren't deal breakers but they should definitely be doable! All in all this Dot is cool and looks good and for the size the sound works. Integration with Amazon music is the bomb! Being a DJ its nice to command Alexa to play anything I want because I'm usually the one getting the requests! Lol\nRoutines are also a nice touch! Being able to say Alexa, shut it down and she shuts off all my lights, electronics etc is the bomb! With a few improvements Alexa could really be something special!

The instructions he was giving were simply not working with my equipment for some reason. We tried the Alexa app on my phone and on my Mac computer. Finally got it working. Took two more weeks for me to get Alexa to recognize and control the two smart plugs I bought. I'm not stupid. The Alexa app on my phone would not allow me to enable skills. Just freezes up. Tried tech support, but a gal with a heavy Indian accent, was worse than frustrating. Trial and error, two weeks later, allowed me to finally figure out how to enable skills from the computer.

Nevertheless I eagerly bought two more 3rd Gen Echo Dots when I heard that Amazon had improved the sound. What a huge disappointment. The Alexa functionality is the same (which is great) but the sound is absolutely terrible. At times Alexa's response is unintelligible, even after repeated attempts. The voice is very muffled as if it is covered by a thick blanket, and this is even after trying to tweak the base/treble using the app. I equate Amazon's attempt to improve the 2nd gen Echo Dot to New Coke (which failed terribly)! Trust me, given the choice, get the 2nd gen Echo Dot, or wait until a 4th gen comes out and keep your fingers crossed.

I have a reptile room and being able to tell her when to turn lights, heat, etc off is very helpful.\n\nAnother thing I really like is the guard option, if she hears glass break or a smoke alarm she will call me or notify me on my phone. This is wonderful because again a huge reptile room with lots of heat and light and that I have teenagers that stay home while I am work. I wake them before I leave but I am always sure they wait till Im gone from the driveaway and go back to sleep. My husband lives 3 minutes away from our house so if we knew smoke alarms were going off he could get there right away.\n\nI also have a small dog who is very attached and experiences separation anxiety and Alexa very easily hooked up to a camera (ring) and let me put it where I could see my dog. I can check on him throughout the day and talk to him or even have alexa call his name and he loves it.\n\nFinally I was offered a 3 month unlimited amazon music trial. Me, my husband, and 4 teens are loving it. I wish the volume was a bit louder but thats not an issue since I can connect another speaker. I love to be able to just say any song title and she plays it. I can tell her to skip or cancel and she hears my voice over the music.

My real purpose was just something to help me keep track of my appointments and it does that OK.. I still have to tell Alexa to add an appointment or add it in my calendar myself, but it does a pretty good job of reminding me.. if I do my part. Some of the things I like, that really didn't interest me before include shopping list maker. I can tell her to add something to my shopping list and she does! So I'm cooking, run out of something- Alexa add butter to my shopping list. Really works very well. I also like turning on and off my lights with Alexa. I did need to add smart plugs to do it, but it was super easy and now I can turn on or off a light with the sound of my voice or the push of a button. Word to the wise-- if your husband turns off the light at the regular switch because he won't remember alexa bedroom light off, it's not going to work for you. I did choose to set up different commands-- bedroom lamp, bedroom light, and just bedroom in hopes that it will make it less painful to remember 1 phrase. If you find something close enough to the phrase, it will still work. I sometimes said bedroom lamp instead of bedroom light. Now either will work. Of course you can't have 2 plugs named the same. Alexa is smart, but not a mind reader. We also have reptiles and I can now program their lights the same way. So I can say Alexa Mortimer day and Alexa knows to switch the routine. I can automate it further to just do it at a certain time, BUT I haven't done that yet. I also like that I can have my audio book read to me, I can set a sleep timer so it will automatically go off.

Now let's list the changes compared to 3rd gen:\n\n1. New look\n\nBigger and weightier\n\nFeels more premium. Visually it blends in better with your home decor rather than a hockey puck sitting on the table.\n\nNo Amazon logo instead has this fabric-like material around it. Very similar to the top of the Google Home Mini.\n\n2. 4 microphones\n\nHas 4 microphones; one around each of the buttons. 2nd gen only had one in the center.\n\nAble to hear you better, especially in the morning as you don't have to raise your voice to tell Alexa to turn off the alarm.\n\nHas higher pick up range by a few feet. Very similar to mic pickup on Google Home Mini\n\n3. Better sound\n\nSpeakers on the device is a night-and-day difference compared to the 2nd generation especially when instrumentals are playing. Still not as good as the original echo with speaker built in\n\n4. DC power\n\nUses a proprietary DC cable instead of micro-usb, which i'm not in favor of.\n\nCan take up outlet plug. May be troublesome if you plan to use it on a power brick/stick\n\n5. LED\n\nLED lights has changed. Has a more fluid movement when lights circle around the device.\n\nLight is also dimmer, but still visible. Good if you have to use Alexa at night when it's on the nightstand, doesn't strain your eyes.\n\nHas a more pink-ish ring instead of a red ring when there's an error.\n\n6. Tactile buttons.\n\nAll buttons are tactile so you can blind feel what you're pressing in the dark. Before, only the action button has raised symbols.\n\nOther than that. Everything else functions the same. Still disappointed it doesn't have back up battery power in case you set up an alarm and the power outage occurs. Unless you don't have a good blueooth or wired speaker to pair with your second generation echo, or you can't raise your voice in far distances then the functionality is basically the same and it's not worth the upgrade in my opinion.\n\nIf you never owned an Amazon Echo device, want another one around the house, or plan to give as a gift then it's worth considering\n\n===\nOriginal Echo Dot 2nd gen review:\n\nYes, it's a slim down version of the Amazon Echo* without the speaker.\n\n*For this review I'm going to refer this item as the 'Dot' and the 'Amazon Echo' as the one with the speakers incorporated in the device\n\nIt functions exactly the same except the voice for Alexa is not as smooth (probably due to the speakers in Amazon Echo).\n\nYou CAN play music on the Echo Dot without a speaker plugged in. Compared to the Amazon Echo you won't get the surround sound feature, but it's pretty decent if you're one who focus more on lyrics than instrumentals. There's an optional Aux 3mm plug in and bluetooth compatibility if you find the sound coming from the dot less sufficient and want to use an external speaker\n\nThe Echo is very portable. Fits in the palm of your hand. Love how the plug on the Dot is detachable unlike the Amazon Echo so it's easy to tranfer to a new location when you need to.\n\nSetup is very easy, just download the Alexa App and following the directions included in the box.\n\nFeatures wise, it's similar to Siri, Ok Google or Cortana: you can ask it questions, make shopping lists, schedule appointments, play music, set alarms, link it to Pandora/Spotify/iheartradio, see traffic updates, sports updates, news briefings, use as smart phone device, voice purchasing off amazon, among other of features. For full list of features or suggestions are present in the app and the e-mail news letter if you sign up for it.\n\nGoing to go through some of the features now and what you should look out for:\n-Alarms: If you own multiple echo devices (Dot, Amazon Echo, and/or Amazon Tap), alarms is device specific. Good for if you have one in the master bedroom, the alarm will not go off in the child's room for example. Whatever you voice set the alarm with, it will go off on that device. Also note that the Echo devices are wifi and power dependent. If there's a blackout or if your wifi is down the alarm will not go off\n\n-Voice activation: if you own multiple echo devices and they're within the same proximity of each other, best to assign different wake words for each so both won't go off the same time. You have the option for 3 wake words: Amazon, Alexa and Echo.\n\n-Voice purchasing: look out for Alexa only deals. There are variety of discounts only offered through Alexa like how the special offers on Amazon Tablet works\n\n-Smart Home. By far the best feature in my personal opinion is the smart phone feature. You do need a smart plug or thermostat that's Alexa compatible, but it makes your life much easier by just using your voice to control the temperature, TV, or on/off the lights without having to walk up to the switch or console.\n\nOverall very good device to have around you home as it improves on your quality of life, and makes life similar if you own a smart home device. I'd get this over the Amazon Echo if you own your own high quality speakers as it's essentially the same device without the speaker. If you can chip in a little more I'd go for the upgrade as the speakers on the Amazon Echo is really good, if you want to compare it to your own home speakers I'd go check out the display demo that are available at some retail electronic stores."},{"reviewerName":"G1977","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"The Future Has Arrived...We are Now \"The Jetsons\" With Echo Dot...So Useful!","reviewDate":"July 20, 2019","reviewText":"The Future is here with Echo, Echo Dot and Alexa. I got Echo Dot at a fantastic price during Prime Day--my son was SO excited when he saw me pull Echo Dot out of the box. I am amazed at all the free skills available for Alexa--this little dot can do so many things. Other skills are available at a nominal cost. You can configure Alexa to do almost anything you want, provided some items (like your car, appliances) are Alexa-ready.\n\nIt is extremely easy to set up Alexa--Amazon sends you an email with instructions. Click on the links and follow the step-by-step instructions. In a few minutes I was set up and enabling skills. Last night we went to sleep to the sound of ocean waves. With Echo Dot comes a 30-day trial of Amazon Music Unlimited and access to 50 MILLION songs. I have Prime Music with my Prime account, so I'll have access to only 2 million...that's enough for us!\n\nYou can command Alexa to play any genre music you like. I found harp music, Christmas music, and even Hanukkah music! We can't even find Hanukkah music on the cable TV music channels where we live, so it was fun listening to the selections on Echo Dot. Not only was traditional Hanukkah music played, but also contemporary. Again, you need to be a Prime member to get Prime music or purchase a subscription to Amazon Music Unlimited (a bargain at $119.00/year) for Alexa to play music. BUT--if you subscribe to another music service like Spotify, Pandora, Apple Music, etc you can still use Echo Dot and Alexa to play music. All you need to do is enable the particular skill for your music service in your Amazon account. What could be easier?\n\nEcho Dot and Alexa offers incredible flexibility, thousands of skills and more are added every day. I highly recommend Echo Dot. I have friends who use regular Echo and are extremely pleased with it--they have their whole house set up with Echo. One friend even has Echo with a monitor, so at any time they command a certain show or movie to be played.\n\nAs a kid I used to watched \"The Jetsons\" and was amazed by all the gadgets they had in their house.

Thoughtful and entertaining","reviewDate":"September 2, 2019","reviewText":"I'm completely in love with alexa. As lazy as it may sound, this tiny device and the app on my phone does so much for me. I've paired it with smart bulbs, my Bluetooth bose, and smart plugs. I'm pretty sure this is one of the best devices Amazon has to offer. We caught them again on sale and for 22.00 at bestbuy and was able to get one for every room in the house. The sound quality is excellent, it's so good sometimes I fail to tell her to connect to the Bluetooth because it's loud enough. Now my drawback is even tho we have one in every room, you have to buy a family subscription to Amazon music to play music more than one device at the time. But if you want her to broadcast the news, the weather, read you a book or the kids a bedtime story, she's amazing. When we leave home, we can tell her to cut the lights on or off by using the app. Now she has a feature I don't quite understand, when you leave you tell her you are leaving, she says OK I will start guarding. But if and when there is noise in the house, she doesn't record the sounds of voices and she doesn't notify you about it either. I had it set to guard, my son and his girlfriend came in from out of town walking taking laughing etc, she did nothing. I come home and tell her I'm home, and she says OK I'll stop guarding. I think the away features should be tweeked. At least let the guard mode send you a notification and a clip of the sounds involved, or send a notification and let you listen to the background so you can decide if it's someone who is supposed to be there or something isn't right. Maybe the technology is still too new but I really hope this feature gets addressed.. It could be valuable and it definitely needs some attention. I've also purchased these at 22.00 for my family members and some friends but with the sale, there was a limit on how many I could buy. At full price, I would only have the one device. I have a Sonos speaker with alexa built-in in my living room but on the other side, I have an echo dot as well. I brag about the features to any friends unfamiliar with it and some of them have bought them and love them just as much as we do. I also bought a 2nd generation from eBay for 10.00 for my grandson whose still little, he likes it but she doesn't understand a word he says..lol. But his mom can walk in his room and tell alexa to read him a book, or tell him a story. They also come with their own phone number which I really like and you can talk room to room. It's hard to get use to calling from it instead of using facetime but it's still handy. Sometimes when you ask for a specific song, you have to pronounce it very proper or she won't understand it. Sometimes she won't understand it or say she can't find it or she will just play some off the wall song that has the same phonics as the title. But to solve that, when I ask for a hard to understand title, I just use the search in my app. I can leave it playing music when I go to work and it plays til I get home. My dog doesn't have to sit in silence. This review ended up being very long but I hope it's helpful. I still haven't learned all she can do yet but I'm working on it... Mad at Amazon right now because they have a stand alone alexa for your car, my friend got hers for 19 bucks but they tell me, I have to be on a waiting list. I don't like the waiting part and who knows how long it will be lol. So for now I have to use the app and my car Bluetooth, but I will survive.

One that stands out is that theirs no weather skill for my area or a news skill for many areas, but I can't fault amazon for that since most of these skills seem to be independently developed.

The house also came with a number of smart-enabled features and after some research, I found that the Alexa system was the best and most affordable option for smart home integration (thanks, wirecutter!). The most shocking thing to me was how incredibly easy it was to set up. I had already set up the main Echo (which was also easy af), so I plugged in the Dot, and it immediately set itself up. I renamed it, and then set up Multi-Room Speakers, and then I played one of my Spotify playlists all over my house at once. GLORIOUS!!\nI've seen a couple of people saying that the sound quality isn't great -- whatever man, maybe to a sound snob, but I guess my standards aren't that high because I think they sound great. It's not a Sonos system, but for $25 a pop, who cares?! I love that I don't have to worry about my phone being out of range of a bluetooth speaker when I'm hosting a party or working on stuff in the house.\nAnother great thing? The devices can troubleshoot themselves. I wasn't sure how to set up multi room speakers so I literally just asked it, \"Echo (I changed it from Alexa), how do I set up multi-room speakers,\" and it just told me. They were also flashing yellow and I didn't know why, so I asked \"Echo, why are you yellow?\" and it freaking TOLD ME? What a time to be alive.\n\nPS: Originally I had some trouble setting up multi-room speakers. For whatever reason, when I first tried to set it up, it only let me select 1 device at a time. I went and checked the settings of each device and confirmed that they were all on the same wifi signal (they were), and then when I tried again it worked for some reason. Idk.

All it will ever hear is me 'singing' along to music and the sound of lots of saws running. Hooked up to my 70's Pioneer receiver and a pair of speakers from the same era that are big enough to be night stands. It's nice to be able to just yell at the thing to play music, adjust volume, and tell it that I hate or love this song, and it does it without me having to stop what I'm doing to do so. It's honestly kind of amazing how well it can hear me given how loud I am usually blaring music, and it's sitting right on top of the receiver, which is sitting right on top of the speakers.\n\nThat said, I am disappointed that it doesn't seem to be able to actually pair with other bluetooth devices to play music through. The pamplet it came with seemed to indicate that it could, and the Alexa app (that needs more permissions than you have to give and wants every antenna your phone has enabled to install) also seems to indicate it should be possible, but after querying Alexa, the app, and google, I haven't been able to figure out how to pair my Dot with a pair of BT headphones.

For me, I like a real stereo system.\n\nWrt integration with and control of other devices, so far not overly impressed. I got the Echo Dot to control my new Denon high end receiver. It can turn it on an off, but only with a complex set of words referring to the receiver. And beyond that it is quite limited. I can't play any particular song over the receiver, only itself....so fairly useless in that regard...or maybe I just haven't worked hard enough to make it work. But largely, as I am using Apple AirPlay from iphone, it won't integrate with that separate system.\n\nI have not yet made the investment in other devices like light control, but have noted my daughter has done that at their house, and use it very little. It is a lot of investment for little return. Maybe some day, when I am old and can't move, it can turn off the lights for me.\n\nMaybe over time I will find more uses for it. At this point, it has marginal value for me. It is an ok value for the a low price. I would definately not pay much more money for it.

I must say that the voice recognition is not yet perfect, but it is very good at this skill as well. I have had the device misunderstand my command several times when the air conditioner is running in the room.\nThere is one little drawback to this device. The skills software routines are incapable of running every app you may have or wish to activate. I have a favorite app that runs a music service that is not Amazon, Apple, Spotify, etc. I must start that app manually. Another drawback with the Alexa integrated environment is the Fire Tablet cannot be used as one of the stations in a music group, for example when I want to play music across multiple rooms. For that, you MUST purchase Echo of one model or another. That bothers me since I use a Fire Tablet on a Show Mode Stand to control my integrated home system, but in order for me to have true house-wide music, I must purchase an Echo device for the room in which I have my Fire Tablet on Show Mode setup.

Initially, the Echo Dot did not see the 5 GHz network on my Apple Airport Extreme, but after an online search, the solution was found. I changed the channel selection on the Airport Extreme from automatic to manual, selecting channel 161, and the Dot connected without issue.\n\nAs I also use smart bulbs, a smart wall switch and a smart wall plug, these were integrated into the Echo Dot and Alexa using the iOS TuyaSmart app, and the SmartLife skill. The skill will link to a TuyaSmart account and integrate the smart devices registered there into Alexa.

The issue with the Samsung device is with a TV; although the device is listed in the Echo, Alexa can turn it off, but cannot turn it on. This dysfunctional control appears to be related to the power state of the TV and the ‘wake on LAN’ control provided by Samsung; however, if a Roku or Firestick (but not AppleTV) is connected to the Samsung TV, Alexa can access them and indirectly turn the TV on when they become active (via HDMI-CEC)."},{"reviewerName":"Scubadu","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Almost returned it!","reviewDate":"August 14, 2019","reviewText":" I almost returned this to seller as I wasn't able to get it to connect to my wifi.

This is not permanent it's just to get your Alexa to connect on it's own. Kinda dumb and confusing. Don't expect Alexa to play Amazon music as it wont connect if it's not a paid service from what I gather. I have a free Pandora account which one can connect from the app then Alexa will let one play music from there once you give it permission to access your account.

The 3rd generation has a smoother, more curved shape, with MUCH more attractive cloth covering that resembles speaker cloth.\n\nThe sound quality compared to earlier models is substantially better. Mind you it's still a tiny little speaker that lacks the physical capacity to really pound out great sound, but for casual ambiance listeneing and voice it is beyond ideal. If you expect more out of a speaker this small, you need to readjust your expectations, it really does sound great considering its size. You want better? Buy an echo input and set up a Bose L1. It will be a TON bigger, but you will have fantastic sound!\n\nNow we run into problems, and they are no small problems. My wife uses the dot to play music through the living room, dining room, and kitchen as she goes around the house, and keeps it cranked up. But the microphones can't hear over the sound of the music, so I have to SHOUT at Alexa to turn down the volume... Even at no music being played, it just doesn't pick up as well as my 2nd gen echo dots.. This is a HUGE operability problem,\n\nMy other complaint with it is that they changed the power input from USB to one of those round input things. Probably necessary for the added power, but it makes getting power to it less flexible, and the plug part is REALLY chunky on a standard wall outlet. Kind of annoying.\n\nLastly I purchased this hoping to get Alexa Guard integration, still not available to me for some reason. Amazon is taking forever getting Alexa Guard set up. I am hoping that they work a deal with ADT to monitor Alexa Guard with ADT SmartThings and not just Pulse once Alexa Guard is setup for everyone...\n\nOverall I like it, but the items mentioned above are genuinely annoying."},{"reviewerName":"J&A","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"DONT BUY THE WHITE ONES","reviewDate":"September 4, 2019","reviewText":"I bought a total of four dots recently.

I've asked Alexa to \"Turn up the treble\" and \"Turn down the Bass\" and she appears to do it.

Note that the truck speaker will sound slightly better but you'll get the idea. The strange thing is the Echo's speaker actually will sound decent if you hold it in your hand with the bottom facing out. This doesn't work if you place it upside down on a surface (I tried all sorts of different surfaces), only if you hold it in your hand.

My new 3rd generation Echo Dot has so much bass, even AFTER opening the Alexa app on my phone and turning DOWN the bass and mid-bass in the equalizer settings, that it's kind of annoying.\n\nBefore, on previous generations of the Dot, Alexa sounded clear, and clean. Now, her voice tends to vibrate the top of my PC where she's sitting, even with all the bass options turned off and volume at 40 percent. I've read a number of posts online about other people where they said that their new 3rd Gen dots sounded muffled or too bassy, and I have to agree. I'd almost like to turn in my 3rd Gen dot for a previous gen, simply because the VOICE sound quality used to be better. Now with all this extra bass, she sounds muddled. Treble turned up, mid-bass, and bass turned all the way off, and she sounds... weird.\n\nMaybe Amazon can fix this in an update? Give us more than a 3-bar equalizer so I can make more adjustments to sound and maybe then I can fix it."},{"reviewerName":"JMN","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"They still have some work to do with the Echo","reviewDate":"October 11, 2019","reviewText":"Ok I got the echo basically because I wanted to control my Amazon Fire TV.

They went thru the same things I did many times, redoing the setup. After several hours without pairing, they had to contact their tech support. Finally after 9pm I get another call from tech support and they asked me to access the app via my Ipad instead of Iphone. Doing this, it paired just find. For some reason my Iphone 6 didnt connect it. Dont know why, dont care, at least we got that far. Then they ran me thru some simple tests...Alexa turn off the tv...lol nope, didnt respond. Alexa turn on the tv, nope. Alexa open Netflix, nope. Alexa whats the weather ? wow , now yes she answered correctly. Anyway, at one point a tech told me I would need a smart plug to make it work..ok got a smart plug and no, didnt work.

(Revised to UGH!)","reviewDate":"May 29, 2019","reviewText":"Update:\nI wish I had never upgraded to the latest (3rd) generation! The device drives me crazy. I constantly have to yell at it to get any response, and that's after they replaced the original, so evidently it's not just a flaw in a particular device. The old 2nd generation on the opposite end of the house on a different floor hears and responds before the one I'm standing beside. Sometimes, she will initially respond (after some yelling), like when I tell her to stop the music, but then when I walk away, it starts again. Sometimes the blue light will spin and she may even say \"okay\" but then not follow the command. It's like Siri (dumb) with attitude. The improved speakers are not worth the aggravation. I'm sure my neighbors don't appreciate the yelling either. I'd give it 0 stars, but it does have much better speakers and I loved the 2nd generation. This one is a lot of frustration.\n\nOriginal Review: I was skeptical about replacing a working prior generation, but WOW--the speakers in this version are SOOO MUCH BETTER! I actually heard it the other day with it in my bedroom upstairs and me in the car, all windows closed! The only problem is that I often have to yell at it repeatedly to get it \"to pay attention to me.\" (That's why it was on while I was in the car--it had not turned off when I told it to do so.) This isn't just when it's at maximum volume, wasn't an issue with the last version, and I have a very loud, strong voice. Sometimes, she doesn't understand basic questions, even about Amazon topics, but her comprehension is far superior to Siri.

I'm just going to say a couple of things that aren't usually mentioned.\n\nOne is why I replaced my old original Dot. She was going deaf. I have several Dots but for some reason the one on my kitchen counter was having trouble hearing me, she would either ignore me or keep saying she didn't understand me. I finally figured out that all of the microphones are tiny holes on top of the device and just like an old man's ears they would clog up with dust and kitchen grease and gunk to the point I had to get a divorce - um, from her - and look for a younger model.\n\nMy new model is more attractive and curvy and sensuous and speaks in a low sultry voice. And that's actually not good. One of the brilliant things about the original design was that Alexa's voice was sharp and shrill and could cut through the commotion of household noise. My new Alexa by comparison sounds muffled, like she has a paper bag over her head. She can hear me fine, better than the old model, but now I can't understand her.\n\nComparing the white color to the first generation there are pros and cons. First off the new generation is all white with a white cord and white power supply. The original had a white body but the top, cord and transformer were all black. I have mixed feeling about that. It does look more contemporary but the mesh side and matte finish on top show dust and fingerprints much more than the older model and already after a few days it is looking a bit dingy. And as much as I like the new power cord the transformer is substantially larger, it actually prevents me from using the outlets on either side of it on my power strip.\n\nOne final thing, you would think with all the money and time spent on developing this product they could have figured out how not to make the two jacks on the back identical in size and shape. The original model had a mini USB power port, the new one has a small round connector that looks just like an audio jack. The user shouldn't be forced to think about which one is the power port and which is the external speaker port."},{"reviewerName":"Rusted Nut Garage","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"An amendment to my earlier review. Re. Home Automation.","reviewDate":"March 11, 2019","reviewText":"I alternate between being awestruck and total frustration. It depends on hat you wish to do.\n\nI have to admit I find the technology to be very interesting. The book I read on it led me to believe that I had to go through some sort of Voice Training exercise to get this to recognize and respond to my voice. I found his not to be the case as both me and my wife no had difficulty in communicating with her. She seems to have quite a range of things that she can answer and I often find myself thanking her and later realizing she probably doesn't care.\n\nSome very pleasant surprises like the fact that I can tell her a word and she can give me the proper spelling, very handy for one who cannot spell worth a hoot. Weather reports, major events, time of day, setting alarms and timers are among the many useful things she can do. Got a song you like or want to hear a joke she can do that. She takes the moral high ground so don't ask for anything X Rated. It is truly impressive what she can do!\n\nBut there is a down side to this. Many of these issues may have solutions however you will need to be much sharper than this old duck.\n\nMy first concern is for security. It is a well known fact that she will occasionally get initiated for no apparent reason. Then there is the fact that I wanted to get local traffic information so I gave here my location and Cell Phone number. I was taken back to find that she had ingested all my contact information without asking! I am not sure where Alexa stores her scripts however I would not be surprised to find it on the Cloud some place (for my money nothing there is secure!).\n\nBut since it is such a neat deal we sorta glance the other way and overlook many of those issues. My next great heartbreak is when we decide to utilize it as the Voice Interface for some home automation. I have managed to get a few things to respond to my voice commands however this road is long and filled with many potholes.\n\nOur first pothole came when I was trying to install the Alexa Software. Originally I had intended to install it on my iMac however I could not get the software to install. I was able to get some assistance and the first thing the man told me was to install it on my iPad (I would be willing to bet there are some issues with the Mac version). We began that process and immediately ran into problems. I have to own up to not checking out the router settings as it will not install on anything other than the 2.4 g router setting. Once we switched the router the installation went rather smoothly.\n\nWe began our home automation adventure with the Starter Kit from Sengled. It is a very good deal with a couple of lights and and Bridge. However there were some installation and compatibility issues. A common thread with most of this Home Automation stuff is that it is not very intuitive and there are no help options in the software. The bridge will allow you to add quite a few lights however they get pretty pricey (this is where they catch up). Now if you think there is any compatibility among the different manufacturers you have another thing coming.\n\nBought some other wifi enabled lights and found I needed to install another app! At last count I have eight different apps running in my home automation group on my I pad.\n\nWireless things that were already on line don't appear to be discoverable and this is also an issue.\n\nNow we have something that was intended to tie all this stuff together however this also seems to be a bit of a train wreck. It is called IFTTT and it was suppose to allow all these different devices to work together. I have been able to use a few of these widgets however I find myself powerless to deal with them. The Alexa Software says that some of them are there however I have little control over when and how they execute! You are suppose to be able to script them and have multiple widgets run from a simple voice command however it looks like this may require another app and that may only run on my phone. There is little help available for IFTTT since it is suppose to be a no brainer (guess where that leaves me).\n\nIt appears that the Hype far exceeds the reality. This would make a fine hobby for some nerd however I find that fun just keeps coming.\n\nThere could be a few more stars available but some one will need to show me of that intuitive stuff they have been hiding.\n\nAn Update regarding home automation. It should be worth noting If you want to use Alexa fore home automation.\n\nSaturday 27 July there was a wide spread internet outage that affected large parts of the Northwest. At first I did not think much about it until I began asking Alexa to do things. Her response was that there was a problem and I should go to the Help Menu in the Alexa app. The did not work as did any of the items I wished to control through Alexa.\n\nIf you loose your internet connection Alexa will cease to function. She will direct you to the help menu in the Alexa App. So if you suffer frequent outages this may not be the home automation app for you!"},{"reviewerName":"Don Ludlow Jr.","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Simply refuse to stay connected and play music","reviewDate":"January 16, 2019","reviewText":"Amazon won't allow pasting my same comments so rather than repeat my 3 of 4 paragraphs check my review on the Echo 2 (Sub Pair.)\n\nDevices continually drop connection to each other and the internet.

Obviously the third word is out of the question since it is too easy to come up in conversation. The same is true for the second and fourth words, but not so frequent. That leaves Alexa. Oh well.

However, research has shown that Amazon is being honest with respect to the mute button. Teardowns of the device show that when the mute button is applied, there is no voltage going across the microphone chip. This is very comforting, as there are certain times when having an \"always listening\" device isn't exactly an inviting thing to have in your home.\n\nAs far as acoustics go, this device is excellent.

One of the mandatory steps is to download the Alexa app onto one of your phones. Android, iOS, and Fire are all supported.\n\nI didn't exactly want to do this, because the app then asks to read all kinds of information from your phone and send to Amazon. I don't really want it to know every person I've ever gotten a phone number from, most of whom I don't call. If I want to talk to someone through Dot -- a big IF -- I just add the number. That's like three people tops.\n\nContinuing ...\n\nOne step is to connect to Dot via its WiFi network. It would then use your phone to set it up.\n\nOn my Android phone, the wireless network has no internet connection, so the first couple of times it dropped. I eventually got this straightened out, but after it connects the app is supposed to allow you to set up the device instead of not respond. Once I got stuck, I'd have to start over from the top, disconnecting power to Dot and repeating the entire process.\n\nNext I tried to do it via my iMac. There is a web portal to connect to. Clicking on a few buttons, you navigate the same place as the app on Android. The UI is the same, only much bigger. At this point, as with the phone you have to connect to Dot's WiFi network.\n\nI got farther here. I choose a WiFi network for Dot to connect to. And then I click submit. The website unfailingly reports a expired authentication or some such error. Again to retry, you'd have to unpower Dot and repower it.\n\nAfter giving this nearly ten tries. I gave up.\n\nGood think I have an iPad. It connected and went through on the second try.

From pill-taking to wound dressing to cooking all you have to do is ask. Music is everywhere - one dot or all dots - your choice. Extremely good quality as I walk around the house. You can ask a million questions and get an answer immediately. Unlike Siri, Alexa has no sense of humor at all. Ask her a silly question and she will ignore you. Smart approach I guess. I just wish I had enough time to learn to use more features. The next function will be to integrate with \"Ring\" security systems and integrate with my thermostats so I don't have to do up and downstairs to reset them. All in all, \"Dot\" is an 11 out of 10 (not a typo). BUY them, don't hesitate."},{"reviewerName":"Casper & Boo","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"like","reviewDate":"March 23, 2019","reviewText":"well hmm i said i would never have one of these or any other like listening device in our house and yet here i am reviewing one we got!! i wouldn't of ordered one myself before, this one came as a free add-on with the ring alarm system kit we bought on here and i honestly had no plan on using the echo 3 and was going to give it away but, curiosity got the best of me and well it only took a day to get hooked on this awesome no-hands device after trying it out. not having to stop doing what i am doing to go turn on music and skip songs or not having to remember to later write something down to buy on a list and just ask alexa to order it has been great since i forget to write things on a list later on 75% of the time. I haven't played around with everything this does, not really into all that game play/etc with alexa stuff. The music, shopping list/cart and phone messaging is all i care about really (am looking at them plugs to turn thing on & off with alexa too now) and there are some issues like everytime i say order/buy something, it gets added to cart and am told to go there instead of alexa ordering/checking out even though one click and all is turned on.. also we first set this up on my ipad and needed a phone number to set up a part in app, being new to this, we didn't realize it would become that ipad's phone number for messages/etc.. and installing app on phone afterwards resulted in us not being able to set up communication on it because cell phone number was already being used by ipad -\n\nanyhow sure others already described everything about this echo 3. i like it, music sounds great to me on it (although not older music) and i can unplug it anytime i want and it easily reconnects by itself within a minute when i plug it back in. i don't bother with that part anymore since i keep it in kitchen corner but, it is nice to know i can unplug it and not have to redo setup when i decide to get more echo's for other areas of our house.\n\ni will say i was suprise at how far/well this echo 3 can hear us, i told alexa to shut off when i was in opposite side of house in living room to see if alexa/echo could hear us there and yup she heard me.. will admit at first that bothered me but, now not so much."},{"reviewerName":"GrzzManBill","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Alexa, please write a review for me","reviewDate":"July 2, 2019","reviewText":"I already had a 2nd generation Echo Dot, an Echo Auto and the Alexa app on my laptop. When I plugged in the new Echo, it instantly synced and did everything I needed on its own. I honestly can't remember how difficult it was to set up my first Echo, but I know it wasn't a challenge. The third generation of Echo is really much nicer looking than the second generation. The sound quality is dramatically better. It unobtrusively sits in the living room without looking out of place. It responds really quick to commands. I will probably get a few more to add throughout the house and will simply replace my second generation unit. I'm continually adding skills and find life is much simpler with Alexa around. When Alexa is added to my refrigerator, washer and dryer, and many other appliances, and Amazon grocery arrives in my neighborhood, my life will be fulfilled. I can ask Alexa to microwave my popcorn on my Amazon microwave and ask my refrigerator to reorder milk. The day is coming and i will happily embrace living in an Amazon home. I'm still waiting for Amazon cellular service and an Amazon car. (Hint-hint there, Amazon!) Imagine if we could only have one bill a month for EVERYTHING we need! Ok, yeah, I might be dreaming.

Nelson","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"It's a nice start, may work well someday.","reviewDate":"March 9, 2019","reviewText":"My real motivation to get the Dot was to create a connected music system. I have two of them, connected as a \"group\", each connected to Edifier 1200T powered speaker systems, which are in turn powered by Dot controlled outlets. The quality of sound now is far higher than the little bluetooth speakers, even though I have a couple of nice ones.\n\nThe system Will consistently will turn on both outlets by automated \"routines\" or on command when calling for my \"upstairs group\", it won't though consistently execute my routine to play music on that group, but often only starts one set of speakers (we typically have well over 20 Mps internet). We don't typically walk around the house shouting commands at each other, so the voice interface is unnatural. I had hoped that the Alexa app might be useful for things like searching for music, but it doesn't have a search function besides again shouting commands it doesn't understand anyway.\n\nOne of the most irritating things is that if it does start music, it may play 3 or 4 songs but then just stops. This is NOT an intelligent system, but rather a command line interface. It only understands exact pre-programmed instructions and figures nothing out based on AI. The voice command system is largely an exercise in futility as a search system, and Amazon's song selection and list creation isn't that great (and yes I'm a premium music subscriber). You can ask it to bring up your Pandora or Spotify lists, but adding longer strings of commands that way, then trying to get it to remember to play on both members of the group? No.\n\nIf I do get the music group going, you can't ask it to change stations without losing one room or the other. It frequently loses one room or the other, although the laggard will generally come back with the next song.\n\nSo it is a nice gee wiz, and yes, I can sometimes get it to play the music I want in two rooms simultaneously. I like that my phone isn't tied up by a bluetooth connection, but frankly, my net result is generally better with bluetooth. I guess I should have sprung for a Sonos system, although that was going to be a lot more money.\n\nBottom line, I'm suffering from buyers remorse. I have nice sound systems in two rooms. I can't say that I have a multi room setup."},{"reviewerName":"Mia","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"So far, having fun, sound a touch muffled, Android app is battery drainer","reviewDate":"March 21, 2019","reviewText":"Finding new things to do with it each day - Alarms and multiple Timers at once, Reminders like \"Alexa, set reminder for lunch at noon on Sunday\", 'she' repeats it back and at noon on Sunday, 'she' tells you, Audible books (subscription) which pick up where you left off, Shopping list (shows up on Alexa app on phone), White noise machine at night (lots of free Rain, Thunderstorms, Crackling fire, Ocean Waves, Wind, etc), Games (song trivia, regular trivia, Word of the Day, etc), Flash briefings (easier to set up on laptop than on phone app) which give you are run down of quick news, or weather, or pop culture stuff - what ever you add to your Flash Briefing list, Entertainment (Music (lots free w/ Prime), Radio Mystery Theater, Choose your own Adventure books (interactive), look for new stuff each day.\nThe voice is bass heavy making it sound a bit muffled but that can be adjusted.

But took longer to use and were less reliable than actual light switches and just remembering when your laundry was done.\n\nIt turned into a case of \"item designed for convenience becomes daily frustration\". Most mornings this past month found me swearing at Alexa after telling her to stop my wakeup alarm for the third time. Or telling her, \"We're leaving,\" so her Routine would turn off the lights and turn on the camera - and then repeating myself five times from two feet away as she insisted she couldn't understand.\n\nFor context - I'm a podcaster and theater trained, I know how to articulate and project.\n\nThe final nail in the coffin was getting an Echo Auto this week. You can't leave reviews on it yet, and not surprising. It's a barely functional mess. I returned it after a couple days of road testing.\n\nIf any kind of background noise is going on - music playing at reasonable levels, for instance - you have to get louder than the noise to wake Alexa. And then, whatever request you made, Echo Auto would pause 30-60 seconds to think it over, probably due to lag speed in connecting to the net.\n\nIn virtual assistants, that's an eternity, and makes you wonder if it heard you at all. When it did finally respond, it mostly got my requests wrong, or started to answer - and then cut off mid-sentence for no obvious reason.\n\nAsking for directions was a joke. I tried asking about businesses I knew had multiple addresses, like gyms and restaurants. I'd say the entire address, and it would ask over and over if I meant some completely different address.\n\nSuggestion to Amazon - you could've bypassed Echo Auto by making the Alexa app completely hands-free and voice-activated on all phones. No idea why hands-free is an option on Fire tablet but not on a cell phone.\n\nMonths of building frustration at all things Alexa finally made me pull the plug yesterday. I boxed up my Dots for sale. There's nothing they can do that other voice assistants can't do from a phone more reliably with fewer steps, including controlling my smart home.\n\nFinal note: quitting Alexa isn't easy. By which I mean, going back through all her settings to delete your activity history, voice recordings, disabling Skills one at a time to make sure your accounts aren't linked anymore, and finally Deregistering the devices. It took a couple hours of button mashing to make sure everything was wiped, and even then I don't think my actual account was wiped. There doesn't seem to be an option for that. There should be an easy, customer-friendly option to say, \"I want out,\" and know that Amazon will delete everything and cancel your Alexa account."},{"reviewerName":"D.

That said, it is an amazing bit of technology, well worth more than the price. Amazon must have been swamped with orders for these things at Christmas as I see it looks like a little back-ordering is going on. And I understand! If I'd known how cool this was back when they had the 2nd Gen for $20 I'd have bought one for everyone on my shopping list.\n\nSet up is easy, but you do need a phone or other device to set it up. After that, it's voice-activated astonishment. Ask for information about movies, the weather, history, solve math problems - it's all there for free. To fully enjoy the music you need Amazon Prime or Amazon Music, Pandora or similar. Over the holidays Echo kept us a steady supply of Christmas music - \"Play Christmas piano music\" - \"Play Andy Williams Christmas music\" - you get the idea.\n\nI keep my 2nd Generation Echo Dot in the kitchen, which is great for setting multiple times, looking up recipes, cooking times, adding items to a shopping list (and you can create multiple lists). The lists are kept updated on your phone, so if my wife needs to add something when I'm on my way to the store, it shows up right there on my list.\n\nVoice recognition is really good, though sometimes it can't provide information on what I'm looking for, something I'm sure will improve in time. Hopefully you'll be able to give it a personal name, right now you're limited to Alexa, Amazon, Echo, and Computer. That's right, \"computer.\" I changed it to that for a day and enjoyed being Captain of a starship. Well, maybe an Ensign.\n\nMy wife and I enjoyed the games feature; turns out the guy who never listens to the radio scored higher than the girl that can sing along with anything. Cool. Then there's stories, where Alexa tells you like a story of the day or something.\n\nAlexa has a little bit of a personality, too, which you'll find as you experiment.\n\nDirecting Alexa to play specific songs or read books from my purchased library is a little tricky, this is where the phone app helps out. By the way, the app can control multiple devices.\n\nI haven't tried the extra features like appliances and cameras, but they seem affordable and very useful. Nor have I added any extra speakers, this 3rd Gen has really great sound, almost like stereo, and you can call up a simple equalizer on your app to change the sound. Volume control is easy, either by voice or by the up/down button on top.\n\nIf you have wifi there is no good reason not to have at least one Echo in your home. It's fun, it's educational, and right now I'd be lost without one. The beauty of it is it available to anyone with a voice; hands-free, no real learning curve.

Dumb way to design a product line.\n*Update As a result of my original 2 star rating, Amazon reached out to me and provided a URL to a webpage with instructions on how to configure the Echo dot, without another Alexa device. It briefly puts your home computer on a network the dot creates. Then you can see the dot to configure it using the PC's browser, including giving dot the wi-fi key to get on your network.

This is really stupid and if you search the internet the same feedback has come.\n\nWith that said the Google one is not any better and the Alexa has better mic pickup when the music/alexa is not talking so this is still your best bet for a voice product.\n\nJust note, I do use the Amazon Alexa alot and it doesn't mean I don't like the product. It turns on my TV, plays music, etc.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint they should not allow it to talk back so loud that it blocks the mic from picking up my voice. That defies the whole point. For example, lets say it starts playing a song I don't like. I have to start yellow Alexa, Alexa, Alexa.

Need to set an alarm before you forget just tell her and she will go off when you need it. Need to set a reminder to call the doctor she can do that too.\n\nI use Alexa for so many things. She starts my microwave, she turns off the bedroom lights when I need her to, and she plays music for me at night to help me fall asleep. I also use her all day during work to listen to music.\n\nThe echo dot alone has a lot of features and it is extremely easy to set up you can have it up and running in less than 1 minute. If you want to be able to use it with your phone you do have to download an app. The echo dot 3rd Generation has decent sound quality it doesn't hurt my ears when I listen to music all day and it does have adjustable sound feature such as the bass and the treble.\n\nIf you really want to maximize the echo dots potential I highly suggest that you get yourself some Alexa compatible light bulbs and Alexa compatible smart plugs.

If you rent an apartment, it might make more sense to do the one Alexa device in the living room, maybe one in the master bedroom, and then use smart lightbulbs and removable smart outlet plugs.

In fact, if you're used to prior generation Echo Dots, in hearing this one it will be as though the engineers granted Alexa a diaphragm -so it takes some getting used to when you hear her speak, but over-all it's a welcome change.\n\n2) Price: is actually more approachable on the newest gen, especially if you purchased at Christmas time 2018 like I did.\n\nAnnnnd.. that's about it in terms of \"better than the last gen\". I did notice that it connected more quickly to the WiFi, but that could also be that I'm more used to the app on my phone and the procedure to connect everything the way it was. So on to CONS.\n\nCONS: As Amazon I'm sure spent more on R&D as well as more material necessary for this model, the bigger speaker as well as the adapter (what a beast) they probably were thinking some parts needed to be cut to balance the cost. This unit has only 4 mics (down from 16 on the gen 2) and while it's not too terrible, I CAN tell the difference. I find myself talking deeper or raising my projected volume in order for \"her\" to wake. Sometimes I see the Echo Dot frantically \"looking\" for the direction of my voice even after waking and getting my request all wrong because it probably wasn't \"focused\" at the best position to receive instructions. I DO think Amazon could of gotten away with 4 less internal mics, I'm also sure they tested things and got reasonable results and that's what I get \"reasonable\" not terrible, but not at the level they set the bar with either; which feels like a disappointment.\n\n2) It's bigger and heavier and uses more power. This should be expected in going through with a newer generation of the same product especially since most loyal to the product will be doing so for the speaker upgrade. So the only reason I bring this up is because my Echo is mounted from under the cabinet in our kitchen. A clever designer created a plastic mount for the Echo 2nd gen (which fits the 1st gen as well) probably with a CAD program and a makerbot and sells these. They are sold in black and also white (which is my Echo's color so it best matches the kitchen even it you manage to see it). When Amazon changed the physical dimensions, I was forced to purchase a new kit (from the same seller who now had an updated kit for gen 3 Dots). So all this to say: if you're upgrading and it's mounted, you will probably be forced to re-purchase something you thought you already took care of.\n\n3) Volume levels. Volume levels are different on this Echo. Typically if you want to change the volume on your Echo you have a manual button on the Echo (which I'm not a big user of). And there is the verbal command \"Alexa, volume 6\" (levels go from 1 to 10). On the gen 2 Echo Dot when doing this, the Dot would play a short tone at the level that corresponds with \"level 6\" -just a helpful feature that allows you to estimate where you need to be with what you're listening to. To my knowledge, Gen3 Echo Dot lost this feature. Surely you can still verbally raise or lower the volume, but there is no audio indicator for what \"level 6\" is out of the 1-10 volumes. I contacted Amazon about this and they \"took it as a suggestion for an option on the Alexa app\" So thank you, but it was Amazon's idea to add this in the first place -it's just as likely their idea to remove it -so, not holding my breath.\n\n4)Power brick. Again it was an inevitability with the bigger speaker. This is the most obvious change to the 3rd gen Dot that most reviewers are upset about. So was I, since it took a good bit of planning to make the 2nd gen dot as hidden as possible while not using some kind of battery to sustain it's power requirements. When I did the math I understood. I didn't like the change, but I do realize it was the cheapest way to satisfy the Dot's requirements to function as advertised. You see, 5V is the max voltage a Micro USB cable can safely carry. Even doubling the cables on one side like some older portable hard drive enclosures used to do to get the twice the power to the device wouldn't get the 12V necessary to run the gen 3 Echo Dot. So you go from a fairly ordinary looking USB A/C adapter/charger to a monsterous looking ...\"wall brick?\" Which could prove a problem for some users depending on how small the space is in the area they are trying to power their Dot in.\n\nSo all in all nothing is a deal-breaker for me( I play lots of music from my Dot), however the lesser feature-set confuses me. Amazon built itself on customer service and then later, the ability to purchase almost anything on their platform. They have become a force to look to when considering what sells since they are inventing and selling sometimes \"firsts\" in technologies. They have even established themselves as reputable technology vendors of products that are at or exceed the level of rival technologies at a reasonable price. So why set the bar and then under-exceed your previous product? As it's said, \" Getting to the top is easier than staying on top\" I don't believe that was the case this time around. I hope someone over there will read my review and take action to truly exceed the 2nd gen Dot in every way."},{"reviewerName":"silverfox","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Hahaha, where to start...:-)","reviewDate":"February 24, 2019","reviewText":"These things are great, just 1 Dot got me into the whole conversion to a \"smarter\" home! I'm just upset I didnt buy a few more Dots at Xmas time when they were at a great price. I'm apprehensive now of buying them new from Amazon for this exact reason, as I think they are too much $ now (at least the Dots...fifty bcuks?!) But there's always eBay, Marcari, and all those other apps where you can find used ones in great shape for cheap. That is what I will probably end up doing for later purchases. They are really cool to have, as you can get them all to sync (like when listening to music), use as intercoms, make calls, stream music, get Amazon notifications and tracking for your purchases, turn lights on/off (If equipped), etc.\n\nIf you're converting over to a \"smart \" home, I surprisingly like Amazon's version over Google's (& I love Google stuff) Alexa is a great way to go. You'll like to have a hub to really make things shine and have, in a sense, a base station for controlling everything but its not fully needed if you just want to be able to control a few plugs and lights, etc. Anyways, having Dots placed in every room is a nice thing to have (which I'm still aspiring to do! Lol) with a hub and some smart light bulbs and power plugs and you're good to go! Doorbell cam? Can set alarms and timing for stuff too. Will also control thermostat if you have a compatible one. Having a hub will really enable you to control pretty much anything and everything that's wifi compatible through simple apps/& or your computer. Wanna see what's going on when your on vacation?

There is a marked improvement in bass output and volume, such that I can hear Alexa speaking several rooms away if I crank the volume all the way up.\n\nUnfortunately, if I leave the volume at a more reasonable level, the 3rd gen dot still sounds like it’s speaking to me from several rooms away. The bass is present, but the mid and treble tones suffer clarity. I can get great music quality from the device if I equalize it with software before the Dot gets it, so I’m sure this thing is capable of a better balance, but as is you’re limited to the undocumented features of asking Alexa to increase or decrease the bass or treble, each of which seem to have three levels (less/normal/more) and I’ve not yet found a happy balance that provides crisp voice quality.\n\nWorse, the number of microphones has decreased from 7 to 4. In my use case (a mud room that frequently has running water or machinery) the accuracy of commands has plummeted, if the thing even hears the wake word at all. The only way to guarantee it hears me is to shout “ALEXA!” at the top of my lungs, wait until I visually see the blue ring, and then scream what I want it to do while maintaining a direct line of sight between my overloud gabber and the device\n\nSpeaking of the blue light, unlike previous generations which would do a spinny “thinking” effect while processing your query, the 3rd gen dot goes dark after it accepts your command, and only lights up again to indicate it has completed your request.\n\nUnfortunately, the ring going dark is the same thing that happens if the device decides you weren’t talking to it at all, so if you’re sending a command that may have some lag before the result (for example, turning on a Zigbee light through an Alexa skill) you kind of have to hope and pray it’s trying to do what you asked, with no way of knowing if your command was ignored outright.\n\nAnd finally, on the subject of ignored commands: follow-up mode has been turned into hot garbage of late. It will listen for your command, and as soon as you’re done uttering it, shut off like a defiant toddler.\n\nMy advice: pass on this model. The 2nd gen Dot is definitely too quiet, but if you already own one, there are plenty of third party drop-in speakers that fix that problem without losing 3 microphones. If you’re new to the ecosystem, plunk down the extra cash for a full-sized Echo."},{"reviewerName":"R G.","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Got for free so...","reviewDate":"July 26, 2019","reviewText":"This device is ok, I guess.

It does have a hard time hearing us when the TV is on sometimes but the room is large and open to several other spaces and we are upgrading to a full sized Echo, so this will be moving to our bedroom soon which likely won’t have the same problem. Caveats: I’d love better support for kids’ profiles and controls/restrictions - not being able to have a full profile for kids means we can’t create separate Apple Music accounts to pair for each person so we have to carefully monitor their use and won’t be buying kids versions yet (among other things like creating routines specifically for them). Love that we can share lists between our household (adding to grocery list while I look at what we have is much smoother than Siri!), but hate that since we share an Apple Calendar for family stuff we can’t link it to both profiles or it doubles all the events on Alexa. It’s also frustrating that only one profile gets notifications on our phones or Apple Watches even though we’ve both linked ourselves to the app, so we continue to use Siri for most of our timers and reminders. The voice recognition is incredibly smooth most of the time - way smoother than Siri - and much faster to process. Skills are still somewhat clunky sometimes (chore chart isn’t worth the time it takes to log things) but love that they can be customized. It would be nice to be able to pick people to share custom skills with so we don’t have to switch accounts every time we want to use them. Routines could use some more features like not counting an apostrophe or comma as a special character and accommodating longer text responses or other Alexa skills but that will likely come in time. It’s also frustrating not being able to see routines that others in the household have created to ensure that we haven’t used the same trigger words or already set something up (and I want to be able to switch in the app to my kids if we are going to invest in more dots).

It is also very easy to use, all we do is speak what song we want the device to play. One of the negative sides is that you need some music service subscriptions to be able to play music and sometimes it does not link well and you need to be tech savvy to figure it out. For example, music from Amazon music is played always super easy and without a problem. However, anytime we try to play music from Spotify, it wouldn’t link to the account unless the app is open on my iPad. This may be a quick fix in settings, but I wasn’t able to figure that out yet.

For example: You have to plug in the Echo dot, wait for one color ring, then hold the button down for 7 seconds, then wait for another color ring, where it then tells you to download the Alexa app and follow the directions despite that the Alexa app doesn't seem to have instructions. You'd think they would put a big red \"FINISH SETUP\" button for you, but no. And you can't search because Alexa gives you a Wifi hotspot that disables your internet connection. The Alexa app on Microsoft demands that you log into an email and remember the password, for some reason, then runs through a whole other setup, so I hope you have everything memorized. I somehow stumbled through it the first time. A couple weeks later, a storm hit and knocked out the power and I had to do it all over again and could not figure it out the second time. Because this thing does not have any sort of battery pack. If the ring is the wrong color, you get to hold a specific button for a specific amount of time.

Basically, the only way to use these speakers as speakers is using Amazon services. Please keep reading before buying!\n.1 Multiroom is only available via Amazon Music, there is no other way to listen to all your speakers at once, period!\n.2 Playing on multiple speakers is an upcharge via Amazon Music.\n.3 Playlist through Amazon Music requires a minimum of 5 clicks per song (think about that).\n.4 There is no way to use or upload ANY music you already own ( or even a way to compile playlists from that music)\n.5 There is currently no way to import or create playlists externally.\n.6 If you use Bluetooth or AUX for outputting sound from the Echo speaker's the speaker sound is turned off.\n.7 The Dots have no input option, so you can't even just use them as a dump speaker.\n.8 I tried multiple equalizer options and nothing I did made these speakers sound all that great. They basically have no range.\n.9 They don't play in stereo either, they play in mono, one channel on all speakers playing to the same thing.\n.10 This is basically a toy, get a Kid Dot if you want, and maybe in a few years this tech will have arrived, it's not here yet.\n\nI could go on but I had the Plus for less than a week and the Dots for less than a day."},{"reviewerName":"Thane","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Cheaper than the competitors and works better too!","reviewDate":"March 29, 2019","reviewText":"Our first experience with a smart speaker was a Google Home. It had a nice app and it did some things, but we had to repeat “okay google!” 5 times before it even heard us. We repositioned it, we reset it, recalibrated the voice commands, etc and nothing really helped. It was too late to return/exchange it by the time we decided it might be a hardware issue, so into the bathroom it went to be used as a music player.\n\nThen comes Alexa. Easier to use and set up, and the physical buttons are easier to use than Google’s (admittedly cool) fabric touch surface. She can hear us calling out her name in the nosiest situations, and I’ve gotten so comfortable with using her that I don’t even look for the lights to see if she’s picked up on my voice anymore. I just call out a command and she follows without fault every time!\n\nWe’ve got her hooked up to my Prime account to deliver us notifications and place orders, she’s connected to our thermostat, she can turn on my TV, and we’ve got her connected to Smart Outlets to control lights and appliances. I’ve almost even forgotten that Siri exists on my phone now!\n\nI love out Dot so much that I’ve been using them as gifts for practically any occasion. They’re incredibly helpful and I’m excited to expand her abilities and even place a few more Dots around the house.\n\nIf you’re looking for a smart speaker, I seriously can’t imagine anything better than this.

These are probably the stupidest and most frustrating devices to use. Let me give you an overall assessment of the AI first, then the differences between the two.\n\nI ask the devices to do something very simple, like to pay public radio, and it plays some obscure non-public radio station.\nThe devices dosn't learn use patterns. At all. When you ask a simple question, the only answers you seem to get have to do with purchasing items from Amazon or Wikipedia definitions. One morning I set up two alarms. I woke up before the first alarm, so I asked Alexa to turn off the first alarm only. Guess what happened. It turned off all alarms. Really stupid and unreliable. Plus, I find myself repeating my requests time and time again. The microphones downright suck. With both you will find yourself yelling at the machine and calling it a dumb b*tch. From this negative association I will never date a gal named Alexa for fear of becoming unfairly opinionated about lack of common sense.\n\nNow, if I haven't dissuaded you from purchasing this junk, let me explain the substantial differences between the Dot and Echo. Surprisingly, the speaker sound difference between the two is minimal. Both are non-obtrusive in size. The larger Echo, however, offers little more than slightly better microphones. I am constantly repeating myself when talking to the Dot. Not so much with the larger Echo.\n\nFor most things, like listening to talk radio or for use as an alarm, the Dot is what you want. The sound from the Echo sounds no better, and if anything, it is a bit more muffled in an effort to make is sound have more bass, which it barely does."},{"reviewerName":"nejpski","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"A very significant upgrade in sound vs the Echo dot 2.","reviewDate":"February 6, 2019","reviewText":"The echo dot V3 has a fuller (less tinny) sound than the Echo Dot 2.

Both powered up and said they were ready so the next thing was to install the app. I was a little confused by the directions at first.

Instead it meant that when the device is in discover mode you will see the network device by whatever name it says to look for.\nSo my first test was simple \"Alexa, play David Gilmore\" and voila the sound was very good. Then I found I could group everything...no only that but if 2 are in the same room they become stereo speakers. (future purchase coming) So I created my Everywhere network and told Alexa to play Meg Myers everywhere. My house was instantly filled with her music.\nSo then the last part was to tell Alexa to wake me for work tomorrow and do it to David Gilmore. The next morning; it is a bad idea to wake up to music you love listening to. You want to lay there and listen to the lovely tones.\n\nI have not gotten into controlling lights or other things like that. But I have installed the \"Thunder and Rain skill\" which is confusing.

I started with the 2nd generation Echo, which is a great device but the first thing I did was hook it up to the expensive audiophile 5.1 sound system in the living room. Once you do this, it's pretty much indiscernible from an Echo Dot. True, it has more mics built into it and in theory should be better at picking up voice commands in a room, but I've not noticed a difference. I now have Echo Dots scattered throughout the house.\n\nHaving Alexa devices throughout the house have the obvious \"smart home\" benefits. But as a music lover and musician with decidedly non-commercial tastes, the most amazing thing about these devices is what happens when you hook them up to decent external sound systems/speakers. I also have a smaller 5.1 system in the bedroom. A decent ancient stereo system in the basement. A Bose SoundDock and a cheaper but decent Bluetooth speaker. Put together into a Music Group, I have fantastic sound throughout the house with the Amazon Music Unlimited account. That's the BEST thing about having these devices: the built in speakers are beyond lacking but these things work with anything. I remember buying my first house decades ago and stringing speaker wires and speaker switches throughout the house. This is way way easier and cheaper!\n\nAbout the AMU account: my first Echo Dot came with a 90 day free trial that I'm still using. Did I mention I'm a musical snob who loves obscure non-commercial music from mostly the 60s and 70s? While it doesn't have full catalogs of many of my favorite obscure artists, it has partial catalogs from a lot of them. Krautrock and Canterbury artists, Zappa, Velvet Underground/Reed/Cale, various progressive dinosaurs, Oldfield, even Jade Warrior and Slapp Happy are there. Henry Cow is sadly lacking, unfortunately, but I guess that's what CDs are for.\n\nAll in all, this is a no-brainer. The only downside is it seems they can't make them fast enough. As I type this, if you order one, you definitely won't be getting it in two days, because they're currently on backorder!"},{"reviewerName":"DJ ATX","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"I’m an Alexa Household!!

Almost 2 Years later, I came to find out I was very wrong! While Google’s platform is slowly getting better, I found that Amazon’s Alexa platform is actually a lot more mature with a wider variety of sensors and smarthome products. Software-wise, Alexa supports way more skills, like way way more. It’s not even close!\n\nUsing both platforms side by side over the last year or so, I found Google assistant (despite being more accurate with factual answers overall) to be lackluster with “skills” and extension/apps.\n\nAlexa also does a few things way better. For example the “drop in” feature alone on Alexa turning the echo into an effective in-house intercom system is so much better than Google’s one way intercom “broadcast” feature. Google’s system is just frustrating in comparison. In fact I ditched it all together so I can easily have 2-way conversations without having to repeat “hey google broadcast...” and then waiting for a reply from the receiver. Alexa intercom system is especially effective with guests and the elderly (who won’t know how to reply or formulate a broadcast message on Google’s system and just wind up flustered and frustrated with the communication method), etc.\n\nDespite running a mostly google smart home system these new echos definitely raise the bar. They work well with my new Ring Alarm System (much more reasonable pricing both hardware and monthly service fees for 24/7 monitoring. By reasonable I mean over a 50% price difference for arguably a worse product -google being the worse product and charging double!).\n\nHardware: Amazon raised the bar with these.

I got one just to try it Fall 2018. I easily forget things on the stove or to leave for an appointment unless I set alarms. My phone is good but Alexa is so easy. You just tell her: set an alarm (or timer...they are different in sound) for 25 minutes. If you set 2 alarms or 6, you can just say: Alexa how many alarms have I set? Or how many minutes are left? Alexa knows lots of radio stations (not many of us have radios anymore), music (she plays your favorites without asking), lots of games (great for parents & kids to do together - listening is important!). If the music is too loud you can say: Alexa, turn it down 3 notches. The only thing that is slightly annoying is when Alexa interupts our conversation. She thinks she hears her name so we say: Alexa, adults are talking! My teen son and I laugh because, of course, we aren't abusive with other people or even our pets...but Alexa can take it! She doesn't do it often so there's no need to turn her off! I ended up getting one for my son's room (Feb 2019) I hear him playing games before bedtime. We also ask her world facts and math questions whilst doing homework. Eventually I'm going to wifi the whole house but for now our two Alexas are a great addition to our home. highly recommend for busy people and families!"},{"reviewerName":"Kindle Customer","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Occasionally Disturbing Moments","reviewDate":"February 2, 2019","reviewText":"Digital Assistants are getting better and better but still have distinct limits. The Echo Dot 3rd generation is no exception. There is information you might think would be easily accessible but is still met with \"Sorry, I don't know that yet .\" Part of it is a learning curve for the user in how to frame a question for the best chance of success so don't give up on one try.\n\nI won't bore you with all of the features because they are quite easy to find on the item page, help, and in the Alexa app, but one recently really helped me out. Being a Baby Boomer, I have the occasional senior moment and managed to leave my purse with my cell phone and Fire tablet in a cab. I stopped hacking landline or VOIP a couple years back. The spare key got me inside, but how to call lost and found?\n\nEnter the little Echo Dot. I used the calling feature to reach customer service, but had the flash that I I should call my mobile to alert the driver. He turned out to be a jewel and was walking up to my door as my phone rang. It would have been fine but knowing I can make calls without my phone de-stressed me right away.\n\nIt does a fine job for the price. I got it on sale before Christmas but like other Amazon devices, you can also divide the cost into several interest free payments. I recommend this digital assistant. It worked well even before I used the voice traing.\n\nAnd as for disturbing? One perk of digital assistants is playing with their Easter eggs and asking loopy questions. I did this with first Siri and later other devices. One wild question early on with the Apple program was asking where to hide a body. They.later made less helpful and supposedly less creepy. Naturally I had to give it a try with Alexa. She responded by offering a recipe for slow cooker carnitas."},{"reviewerName":"Rick Masseur","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Easy Setup and Great Sound!","reviewDate":"November 23, 2018","reviewText":"Of course, the setup was easy.

The response is fast, given the increased number of listening microphones. But the biggest difference for me between the 2nd generation and this 3rd is the sound. Huge improvement! And get this: IMHO the sound from the 3rd gen rivals the sound from the 1st gen Echo! I personally think it's better. I bought two for my workout room and paired them to play stereo. Very nice sound!

This makes it easy to stream music to all of the Alexa devices at the same time. Incidentally, we also have a Show and a Spot which both work just fine too. I recently purchased two new Dots on sale from Amazon... I spent a week trying to get them to work to no avail. They just drop out when playing music after only 1-3 songs.\n\nI went nuts checking my internet and wifi signals everywhere... our wifi coverage is all great. Next, I moved on to just testing an old Dot in its usual place for an hour... worked perfectly streaming music. Then replaced it with a new Dot in the same exact location... it would drop out to silence within 1-3 songs. Put the old Dot back in place... worked perfectly for an hour. I did this with both Dots in multiple locations and the two new Dots consistently failed. It was clearly the new Dots that had some defective component in them.\n\nI've returned the two Dots. The return process was a nightmare as well. I wanted to exchange these for new ones but I had to wait on a call from Customer Service... I couldn't just check off an exchange on their returns page. They insisted upon talking to Customer Service... the page indicated they would call within 10 mins or so... I waited two hours... no call. In the end, I have opted to return for a full refund instead.\n\nWhen I purchase the last 2-3 Dots that I need to complete the home, if I get one more defective unit, I am done with the Echo line. I'll toss them all in the garbage and purchase another brand. This problem has wasted far too much of my time.

We've played all kinds of music through SiriusXM and had no problems at all with the sound quality. Alexa's voice is very clear and there's no problems understanding what she's saying. So far, I've used it to set alarms, play music, read us stories, ask general questions, turn on lights. I really wanted to use the \"Drop-In,\" feature connected to another Dot on a second floor (which is on another account) but found out that I have to have a \"mobile phone number\" which I don't have, so that was very disappointing for me since that was a big reason why I bought it. The other thing I can't get it to do is remember the \"sound\" I chose for the Alarm. It always manages to jump back to the Default sound, which isn't terrible, but isn't my choice, either. I've yet to figure that simple thing out and the help files aren't much of a help.

It is quite standard to have a 1 year warranty included for pretty much anything technology and google home has that on their product.\nI am frustrated because I bought 3 of these units for $50 each about 6 months ago and one of them has failed already. Furthermore, when I spent $50 on each of these they went down to $29.99 just weeks later and I was not given an option for a price match. When the product was working, The sound quality was good and overall I enjoyed it but I am very disappointed in the quality of it and how it isn't backed by a real warranty. I also want to share few things in terms of the device itself which I find to be major problems. The first is Alexa's Spotify integration. The controls are very limited in terms of choosing your playlists and alexa easily gets confused when asking her to play one. Furthermore if you are like me and have a spottily family account it is very annoying to switch between accounts. I thought that alexa would be able to detect my voice and use my profile but that is not that case. You need to tell Alexa to switch to xyz account. Then you need to tell her to play music, then if you are lucky the speaker will show up as an available device from your spotify. At least now that my echo is broken and won't be eligible for warranty repair I have a great opportunity to get OUT of this amazon ecosystem and buy google home. I know google home has the features I want like better spotify family support & a warranty that isn't a joke."},{"reviewerName":"Nicole NV","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Magic in a little Dot!

Let me start off by saying that this is good for a small room, kitchen or small living room. When asked a question Alexa pretty much understands unless there is something playing in the background or when she’s playing a song you might have to speak up a little louder for her to understand, As for sound quality I would say that it has no bass, but it is pretty decent in sound, Not that I would use for playing music all the time unless I was using it in the kitchen. The Dot is awesome! It’s good for weather updates, to set alarms, reminders and for shopping lists. I try to leave this device in the kitchen to let her know what I need, I could even send my grocery list to my husband manually through a text from Alexa Or ask for recipes. My four year old son has a speech problem so this Dot has been very useful it makes him have to say the words correctly or she will not understand him, my son has a hard time pronouncing words, he wants to get it correct so he tries very hard to pronounce the words better without throwing a fit, so that’s another plus, my son’s words have improved to the point where she’s able to understand him now, my son likes to speak to Alexa so that she will play music for him or speak pikachu he loves pikachu and all Pokémon characters. You could say we like it so much that I purchased the echo plus 2gen so we could leave echo plus in the living room and I could actually keep the ech dot to myself cause my husband and my son keep taking it from me!"},{"reviewerName":"Brandi","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Undecided","reviewDate":"November 3, 2019","reviewText":"I love this thing when it works.

I've tested wifi strength and connection while it's malfunctioning and wifi is not the issue. Neither is location, as I've tried multiple placements in respect to the router with no improvements.

Mission Accomplished! I can now listen to Kindle and Audible books or News Briefings (with variable volumes from one news source to another), even when in the shower.\n\nThe reason for four instead of five stars is because of two things that could be better:\n\n1) The bass is too high, and I do not know how to adjust it. The lower frequencies overpower the upper and mid-tones. The dominant bass makes listening to books and news a little less pleasant, more difficult.\n\n2) When using it to control lighting in the adjacent room, it does not understand us very well in spite of the wide opening between the rooms and no background noise.

I know some people have a problem with the Amazon echo because they believe that Amazon is listening in and recording what they say, and I don't think this is exactly denied by Amazon either. The seems to make a lot of people nervous, however when you think about it it's not that much different from having your smartphone on you. Your smart phone can listen, and track you with GPS, what difference is it by having an echo in your house? If you want to get away from anyone that can listen, leave all electronics and take a walk in the woods. As far as this Echo goes, it works very very well. Sometimes, I have noticed that I need to word things a little bit differently in order to get the result I want, which seems a little silly, however I have acclimated quite well in order to get it to do what I want. For such a small little thing, it has an amazing speaker in it. It plays really really well, and with the echo subwoofer it is amazing. The only thing I've really noticed about the echo Dot, is that on max volume the speaker doesn't have as great of sound. But considering that max volume is absurdly loud anyways, I usually don't put it that high at all and I never have any issues with sound. I have also noticed that sometimes the echo doesn't want to give commands to other third-party apps such as robot vacuums, there's been a lot of problems with it.

I replaced a 2nd edition that was in constant use in our bedroom with this one and relocated the old one. This “swap” matters because we’ve been using the bedroom one for a year and would immediately notice any differences.\n\nIs it better than a 2nd edition? I think so, but the improvements are subtle. The speaker sounds different. The 2nd edition one sounded very “bare” and “hard” in comparison. The new one seems to have a speaker that sounds “softer” or maybe even a slight bit “muffled”, but we don’t have any problem hearing or understanding. I still wish that the audio was not transmitted in 360 degrees because most people probably aren’t placing these in the center of the room. I think the sound directed towards corners of the room is potentially wasted, but this speaker seems more powerful than the 2nd edition one so it doesn’t seem to be as much of a problem.\n\nAs I said before, the improvements are subtle, so I think the microphone is also improved. I think Alexa can hear and understand us a tiny bit better.\n\nAt the price I paid, it is definitely better to get a 3rd edition instead of a 2nd. I think 2nd edition works just fine and if you had no 3rd edition to compare it to you wouldn’t be upset at all.\n\nSo why the 4 stars and not 5? Because the app is garbage and Alexa is a huge pain in the butt. Case in point, I set up this Echo using my phone. We had some trouble because it would only play samples of songs. We figured it was tied to my account and not my wife’s (who had the Music Unlimited plan tied to hers). We both checked in the app and the device said it was associated with my account on my phone, and HER account on her phone! We both share the same prime membership, so I’m not even sure why this matters, but it does. After two attempts to set it up with her phone it finally seems to play music unlimited.\n\nThe worst part of it is how dumb Alexa is. She can’t even tell you which account the device you’re talking to is registered to: “I’m sorry, I don’t know that one.” She doesn’t know, and the app wants it to be registered to everyone - which is a nice gesture, but just not true.\n\nI’ve explained in some depth the problems with Alexa, but to paraphrase: NOT SMART. If Alexa was capable of more than one command at a time and had a longer memory than Dory, it would be a drastic improvement.

My experience up to this point has been with a Gen 1 Dot have had on my nightstand for years and recently a Gen 2 Dot. The Gen 3 is the worst of the three, but first a little base-lining.\n\nYou primarily buy an Echo Dot if you plan on attaching speakers whether wired or wireless. If you plan to use the device standalone with even an inkling of playing music, then you should go with one of the larger Echos and not the Dots as regardless of the Dot, the sound isn't going to be good. Dots = external speakers or news, full-size Echos = everything.\n\nThe worst thing I've found with the Gen 3 that the other two generations didn't have is a buzzing when turned off (not playing anything). There's a buzzing through the speakers. Thing is, I also bought a Gen 2 Echo and it does the same thing. There's a buzzing, even when the volume is low, coming through the speakers regardless of whether the speakers are external or internal. it's something inherent to the latest devices/hardware. it's terribly annoying and I can only assume something is wrong with the devices. As mentioned, neither the Gen 1 or Gen 2 devices have this problem.\n\nThe buzzing is annoying as heck and the only way to \"stop\" it is to either play something or turn the volume down low on the external speaker, but then everything is lower. To stop the buzzing, I turned down my speakers so that what now must play at a Volume 5 on the Gen 3 Dot is equal to what the Gen 1/2 did at Volume 2. When it comes to the full-size Echo, there's nothing you can do. It just buzzes even when at a low volume.\n\nThe other thing I've noticed is that the Gen 1 and Gen 2 were far more sensitive and responsive than the Gen 3 Dot. I could speak at what I consider a normal volume regardless of what was playing and the Gen 1/2 heard me. Not so for the Gen 3. i also have to slow down to let the Gen 3 Alexa catch up to what I'm saying which wasn't a problem with the Gen1/2.\n\nI can only assume that there's just something wrong with the device.

Now my logical brain deduced quickly that the two devices could not both be damaged because that was too much of a coincidence.

So hopefully that's an issue you guys are already aware of if not maybe I can bring it to your attention right now, but that is definitely an issue that happens. so ever since we have mounted are device on the ceiling and the cord is securely connected to the mounts and will not become loose anymore we have not had this issue, but this could be a serious problem for all the customers who are buying these devices and then just thinking that they're crap and sending them back now I love you guys Amazon so I knew that was not the case so I had to figure that out but I just wanted to let anyone else know that this is an amazing product I love it very much but if you start having that distortion of the sound problem like I was check your power cord and make sure it is securely plugged in."},{"reviewerName":"Nate-G","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"The entire Echo system has changed for the worst...","reviewDate":"December 2, 2018","reviewText":"I changed my review from 5 stars to 1 star because of a software update that now forces me to specify which light, power strip, and/or other devices I want to turn on/off.

Each light, outlet, and other devices have a unique name (IE: The upstairs hallway lights are named UH-Light, UH-Light2, and UH-Light 3, my smart power strip has unique ports like TV, Monitors, etc..).\n\nYESTERDAY (9/18/2019) I was able to walk into a room and say \"Alexa, turn the light on\" (in my home office for example) and it turns the light on, Today (9/19/2019) I'm sitting in my home office and I say \"Alexa turn the light off\" and I get the response \"There are multiple devices that share that name, which one do you want\".\n\nThe master bedroom - Setup with only lights (MBR-light, or something like that so I can identify it later when adding other stuff), the wife used to say \"Alexa, turn the light off\" because that's what she has always said before going to sleep. Today she can't do that because of Amazon's development team.\n\nSo I say \"Alexa turn the office light off\" and it turns the ENTIRE OFFICE GROUP OFF. So now I have to go to the app to turn the light off.\n\nI reached out to Amazon customer support who tells me I have to be specific when asking the echo to turn the light off as in \"Alexa, turn the office light off/on\" and that it has always been this way. When I tried to tell them that yesterday I was able to say \"Turn the light off\" they said it wasn't possible and I have always had to be specific.\n\nI set up groups for a reason, that being I can go into a room, say \"Alexa, turn the light on\" without having to remember each light bulb name or what I named the room/group. Yes, I know what the group names are, I don't expect everyone in my house to remember the group names.\n\nThere was a software/firmware update overnight that broke all of my Echo's and Amazon's customer support will not acknowledge it.\n\nI will not recommend this device to anyone else until they put it back to the way it was."},{"reviewerName":"J1976","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Pretty darn cool","reviewDate":"July 27, 2019","reviewText":"My wife refuses to let me use this in the main part of our home so the three I purchased have been quarantined to my personal spaces.

Anytime you ask her a question she says she doesn't know or just directs you to a webpage. Alexa on the other hand will actually answer you questions which is amazing! We also recently purchased an Emerson smart thermostat which I was easily able to connect and can now control the temp with ease. Alexa is also such better at understanding me when compared with Siri.\n\nFor me the biggest down side of Alexa is that I don't believe it has the ability to send text messages from my iPhone which is a big bummer.\n\nThe audio is about a 6/10 so that could be a bit better as well.

I couldnt believe it, it made me happy again to be able to do some of the things I purchased the dots for in the first place. But then I got upset again. What if I would have never posted a review? I would still be thinking that they didnt work. How come we dont have someone call or email or atleast text us to see if the dot or other Amazon product is living up to expectations. Shouldn't this be required. But this is a review not a blog. I would suggest that if you have or are going to purchase an Alexa device contact the alexa department with any questions because they are the only ones really trained and can give the correct answer! Like I stated earlier I am happy with my dots now, I still feel a little work has to be done but that is true to any device that is still developing! This starts my original review, You really need to look at all the things that this can do, you really don't even need to waste the money to purchase, just download Alexa on your phone. It doesnt really do much more than that. We purchased them because we seen where it can control your fire TV with the echo dot, well let's just say that isnt 100 percent accurate. Yes it can control SOME things on your fire TV, however these aren't really the main things. You CANNOT control the volume, power, you CANNOT search your prime videos, let me just give a list of what it can do that would be alot less time consuming.\nSo the only things that you can control with the echo dot are Bravo now CBS NBC Hulu and the playstation network that is it! Now granted I'm sure I'm going to get alot of heat for dissing this device. And I am sorry, I know it has taken people alot of time and energy to get where it is today, I just feel that selling it at the price it is, it should really be able to do atleast what the remote Alexa can do. And yes it is my fault for just assuming that one Amazon device can control just like another device I should have read deeper into it. My fault, one that i wont be making again! Please take my advice and look into what it can do before you buy. Go the cheaper way and just download Alexa on your phone or tablet! The only good thing is I can command whatever music that I would like to listen to because we pay for a subscription to Amazon music. Is anyone else seeing a theme here, it will control paid apps easily, just not the free ones! Just sad that we have to be taken for our money like that, it's not good enough that we pay top dollar for devices but we pay for subscriptions to 3 or 4 different apps."},{"reviewerName":"CARLA HART","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Alexa is to hard to setup and customer service just keeps hanging up on you.","reviewDate":"October 19, 2019","reviewText":"I spent 5+ hours trying to set this thing up. 1st as Alexa.

I've had a NAS (network attached storage) with all of my music, movies, tv, audiobooks, etc, stored on it for decades now. It's all distributed by DLNA - an industry standard supported off the shelf by everybody. I should be able to ask Alexa to play my own music from my own house - without paying more fees to stream a subscription service that STILL won't have my music on it. I want Alexa to play audiobooks I already own without paying for another subscription to an audiobook rental service.\n\nI also want Alexa to control my Fire TV. The Fire TV has an Alexa remote! I can see the TV in my kitchen, where this Alexa device is, and I want Alexa to play a TV show or movie on it. Two Amazon products, can't even communicate with each other.\n\nThose two are the biggest complaints about stuff that's missing that I expected to work.\n\nWhat's also frustrating is what barely works. If your music choices are very pedestrian, it's nice to say \"play some 80s music\" and let it go in the background. It's better than FM radio. Really though this shows how poor this option is - the selection is really shallow and repeats songs. There were 230 songs from that decade just counting the ones to hit #1 on Billboard. That's an entire day of listening to music just playing number one hits. Expand that to the top 40 or top 100, you could play 80s music for a month without hearing repeats. We should be able to give complicated commands to our voice servants like \"play every top 100 hit from the 1980s in order\". It's all databases, these are easy queries! pssh\n\nIf you want to hear something very specific, good luck. Try to play classical music or opera by a specific performance, nope, too much detail confuses Alexa. If a performer has multiple versions of a song (on a live album and a studio album, for example) Alexa plays the first one she finds. Songs that have been covered by multiple performers, expect to never hear the one you want. Don't expect to hear any song that has non-English lyrics, if you can get Alexa to play artists from outside the USA/UK/Can/Aus English-speaking world at all.\n\nThere's also the issue of being so rude to mispronounce my name and not being able to correct it."},{"reviewerName":"Brendon Goede","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great add on Alexa for rooms where you don't listen to much music","reviewDate":"August 29, 2019","reviewText":"Personal Experience:\nThis was a give away during Amazon prime day and I placed it in my basement where my kids like to play.

You can ask Alexa anything and she will answer it as much as she can, and if she cannot find the right answer, she will tell you that she doesn't know instead of just listing off things related to the subject you are referring to. You can send her commands to announce things which is very cool, she does have an explicit filter by the way, so the profanities you try to get her to say get bleeped out. Ask for any song or artist and she will immediately connect with Amazon music to start streaming what you are looking for. She'll turn up or down the volume for you, and she has very good hearing, she can even hear you from other rooms or if you are speaking very quietly. My only regret is that I did not buy more of them!\nUpdate: since I posted this review I have purchased 2 more, and it amazing. I have one in my bedroom, one in the living room, and one in the playroom/workout room. You can create a group for them so that you can effect all devices! For example: my groups name is everywhere for the echo dots, if I say 'Alexa, play Metallica everywhere' Metallica will start playing on all devices. You can even give each one it's own name. The one in my living room is named 'living room' and the one in the bedroom is named 'bed'. I can be sitting in the living room and say 'Alexa, announce to bed, it's time to get up' and the echo dot in the bedroom will play the recording of my voice telling my girlfriend to wake up. You can even set up your own questions and answers in the Alexa app so it can literally do whatever.

However, if you don't want to read my entire review, when considering all my thoughts on Gen 3 Dot, I still absolutely recommend everyone own one.\n\nPros:\n\n- Setup start to finish, out of the box to ready is less than 3 minutes.\n- Gen 3 looks substantially nicer then Gen 2.\n- The speaker is improved from Gen 2. With that said, the bass is still laughable. However mids and highs are much improved and push well rather than screeching at high volume.\n- If you actually explore the vast skills Alexa can do and what Dot excels at, this unit can do a great deal and absolutely be useful from day to day. From updates on Amazon orders, to ordering from Dot, to playing music, or setting an alarm and then having Alexa tell you about your day, this unit can do a great deal and do it well.\n\nThere are many more pros but nobody wants to read a novel so I chose what's most important.\n\nCons:\n\n- When you set this up, if you do it on your phone, you need to exercise caution doing so if you don't want Alexa to have your entire contact list. If you give that permission, your entire list will be in the cloud. Just a heads up.\n- Alexa can make calls with Gen 3 Dot, and the process is flawless. However, if you actually expect to have a conversation with someone, you had better turn the volume up very near max, or they will not hear you. Also, there is lag between parties on the call and I've verified that a half dozen times.\n- Alexa still struggles with certain words, phrases, obscure songs, and questions, if you don't word them in specific manners. Given, as you use your Dot, Alexa will adjust to you and get better, but it can be frustrating even for someone like me who's a technology freak.\n- Alexa often mistakes you when you say to adjust sound down and instead adjusts it up. This fades after you've said the phrase a dozen or so times.\n\nAs with the pros, I could go on and on, but nobody wants to read a novel so I picked the most important factors to help you make an informed decision.\n\nLook, in many ways, for many people, Alexa products, specifically Dot, are used mostly as toys. A lot of people play with them a few weeks or months and gradually give up on them. Why? Usually, because they lack patience working through the kinks in the interface and also because they simply never explore the thousands of skills this can perform.\n\nSo my question to you is do you consider this a fun toy or do you consider it an exciting technology with a lot to offer? If you consider it a toy, just save a few bucks and buy a used Gen 2 used, for under $20. If you consider it a useful technology and plan to seriously explore its possibilities, I absolutely recommend this as a way to get your feet wet or to add to your Alexa connected devices. Yes, this is still a technology with a long way to go, but it's worth owning and growing with!\n\nCheers!"},{"reviewerName":"Johnnie P.

It has been even better than I expected ! Setup was very easy and quick. I was also able to pair my Dish Hopper to the Dot. Now I can just say, \"Alexa ! Change the channel to ESPN\" and it gets there quicker than I could pick up the remote and change the channel ! For someone that has had a stroke and losing the use of my right arm and hand this is really useful for me. I love to play music while I get ready for the day. I usually use an app on my Bluray player which is time consuming just to get the first song played. Now all I have to do is say,\"Alexa ! Play Thumbs Up radio \" and bam! it's playing that fast ! I can check on the weather before I leave the house in an instant. The sound quality of the Dot 3 amazed me from the moment I first heard it. From the reviews I've read, it's obvious that most people don't understand that some rooms just don't carry sound very well.The unit is kind of heavy for such a small item which I assume is because of the magnet of a much better speaker than previous Dots. I don't know how anyone could complain about the sound quality of the Dot 3 considering how small it is. Some people complain about everything. Just keep that in mind before deciding not to buy this because of a bad review. Ten years ago this item would have cost you thousands. This item is well worth the price.Like anything electrical or mechanical,you have to learn how to use it and then how to best use it for your needs. It really isn't hard. If my wife was using this the first day then I can tell you, it has to be easy.I will be buying more Dots since I have learned that you can place a unit in another room and use as an intercom.

My brother in law loves to listen to music, so I decided to get him a 2nd gen Echo and 2nd Gen Echo Dot. I’m really amazed with the quality of sound. A month later, I bought another 2nd gen Echo that came with 3rd gen Echo dot For $99+. I gave the Echo to my brother in laws mom for her birthday and kept the Echo dot.\n\nAt first, I thought the voice command is awkward but I got used to it. I use my Echo dot to listen to music, ask for forecast, news, timer, and ask some general questions to Alexa if I’m lazy to look it up on the internet.\n\nI also leave Echo dot playing all day for my kitten so he won’t feel sad. We leave him all day alone at home whenever we go to work. I can also control Alexa from my phone like play audio books or music.\n\nThe downside:\nI hate it when Alexa can’t undersrand my accent. Yes, English is not my first language. So it’s annoying whenever I ask Alexa to play songs from an artist in my home country. I have to say the vowels and consonants in American Way instead of how I would pronounce it on my native language just so Alexa would understand me.\n\nAlso, amazon says Alexa gets smarter, but i think only if they add new apps instead of intuitively adapting to your commands. Like for example, I wanted to Alexa to play certain songs on repeat on Spotify but she will say that the feature is not supported. I can still play songs on repeat but I have to open the Alexa app on my phone and press the repeat button for that particular song that I just played. Anyway, this is just me who loves to play a song over and over again.\n\nAnother thing is, if you turn up the volume too loud, Alexa will have a hard time hearing you. The only way is to shout so she can listen to your voice command.\n\nI would recommend Echo Dot to everyone. As a matter of fact, I bought 6 pieces last Black Friday for a good deal so I can give them as gift for Christmas. But I needed to another 2 again after Black Friday without the promo.\n\nI also gifted Echo Dot (2nd generation) to a couple of friends, which is a bit cheaper. I needed it the next day but Amazon ran out of stocks of Echo dot 3rd so ended up buying the 2nd gen Echo dot.\n\nI also own google home, but i think the Echo dot 3rd gen is better."},{"reviewerName":"Jess","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Definitely worth the price!!

I was first introduced to smart speakers when I received an insignia smart speaker for Christmas in a dirty Santa game. I was instantly hooked on the whole concept. I've been an Amazon member for years and I have much trust in the Amazon brand, so I thought I would be upgrading by purchasing an Echo. Sadly, I've found that Alexa and the Echo device are outdone by a cheap Insignia device and Google Assistant.\nAs far as the Google Assistant smart technology goes, I've found that Google is able to do a few things that Alexa cannot. For one, Google's accent can be changed to alternative accents of the english language and can still understand you and produce results from questions pertaining to region. I personally prefer the Australian/New Zealand accent to the American, but Alexa often didn't respond to her name and couldn't perform features such as the weather, making phone calls, etc. when her language was changed to Australian. While the next feature is actually a comparison of Spotify to Amazon Music, I found that Alexa's ability to find playlists and find a wide range of music paled in comparison to Google. For instance, when asked to play a song, Alexa simply finds the song and plays it, while Google finds the song then continues to play recommended music based off that song. As far as the actual device goes, the Insignia, which costs about $40, features a visible clock and a usb port for charging other devices, while devices with Alexa that feature a clock cost close to $100, and I am unaware of one that has a usb charge port.\nIn truth, the only feature of Alexa that I really prefer to Google is the wake word. \"Alexa\" rolls off the tongue better than \"Hey Google,\" but this is hardly a game-changer.\nHopefully, Amazon will step it up and update her abilities, especially when it comes to language."},{"reviewerName":"Wade Manns","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"An absolutely excellent smart speaker with so many great functions.","reviewDate":"December 9, 2018","reviewText":" Well, I had a very awesome Cyber Monday! Though I only bought one thing, it was definitely a doozy! It is nothing less than Amazon's own smart speaker, connected to one of the best virtual assistants that I have used, Alexa! (I realize now this statement doesn't carry much weight because there's only four major ones, but I will now say that this is the best I've used, due to its ability to do pretty much everything I can think of, and ease of access - I can just talk and it works! (This is also true of Cortana, but Alexa is not dependent on a large, heavy-power-drawing device like a computer running Windows to be usable, so Alexa wins.)\n\nAlexa can answer pretty much any question that may come to mind, though there are a few that still haven't occurred to her, but that is fast changing due to crowd-sourced reviews and feedback that are easily provided for every interaction! And that's even before I mentioned the thousands of skills, reminders, timers and routines and all sorts of awesome things that the assistant can do. And all when you say her wake word which just happens to be Alexa (though I am authoring this with a text-to-speech program, I must type the assistant's name to avoid awakening her so many times :) ).\n\nThe device itself is pretty elegant, as you can see my picture and video. It's grown up quite a bit from the second generation which I have never had, but it is larger and heavier, and has a big old band of cloth around it instead of it being plastic with the Amazon logo. There are four buttons on top: two for adjusting volume, one to perform some kind of action which might actually double for using the wake word; I'm not sure yet, and one to mute the microphones, of which there are four of the far-field variety, which enable the speaker to hear your voice even when it is far away and rather quiet, or when music or other audio is playing through the speaker itself! That's pretty awesome.\n\nSo many other people have talked about the virtual assistant, Alexa, that I will not waste time here, because I'm mainly here to talk about the speaker itself. And I will close by saying, I'm not really concerned about a proprietary power solution over a USB solution, though I am aware that some inconvenience can exist when one cannot use power adapters one already has. Doesn't affect me, though. And the speaker is actually quite loud, probably potentially the loudest Bluetooth-enabled speaker that I've heard, and sounds wonderful pretty much no matter what is played through it!\n\nI most definitely recommend the Amazon Echo Dot third-generation! In your color of choice, though the Sandstone does look very snazzy :-) thank you, Amazon for providing us all a wonderful and affordable entry into the exciting world of virtual assistants and the Alexa infrastructure! I will treasure it forever. And, who knows? I may kit my house out with at least a couple more before holidays are out.\n\n(EDIT: As a side note, I just played back the short video I linked above, and Alexa woke up again and gave me several varieties of cheese. She's just that awesome.)"},{"reviewerName":"Linzhoo2u","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Yes, yes, yes!","reviewDate":"December 18, 2018","reviewText":"AMAZON. I was mad at you for a while because you rejected a nice review of a company who sold me a great product so I vowed never to write another glowing review but I am SO happy at my purchase that I just had to share.\n\nI have to admit that I am the kind of person who is overly suspicious of \"big brother\" listening in but I took a chance while the dots are on sale and boy am I so glad I did. This dot is the best! I now have several scattered throughout my house, and love all the features it has to offer:\n\nThe first thing I did after installing was ask Aleksa to play some holiday music. BOOM. There it was. In really great quality considering the size of the speakers. Wow. Then I started exploring, finding out all that Alexa has to offer. I asked for the weather, the meaning of life, and whether my husband is still cheating on me (Alexa said \"Hmmm, I don't know) so the jury's still out. Next I discovered Alexa's skills. The kids can now ask where Santa is and get a very personalized answer. They love asking Alexa questions, and my daughter even said Alexa you are beautiful to which she responded \"and so are you, you are so beautiful\" so she is winning over our hearts. With the new \"announcement\" feature that targets specific devices I told me husband my new favorite hobby is scaring the kids when they think I don't know they're really up playing games when they're supposed to be in bed. And finally, I drift off to sleep using this guided meditation skill I enabled. I have not slept so good in many years. Thank you.\n\nThere are a few drawbacks- my youngest son is named \"Aleksa\" which is pronounced slightly differently but still is enough to trigger the echo. But we will be changing the wake-up word via the app which is super helpful. I also notice that with our shoddy internet that of more than 1 person is using Wifi than the speaker cuts off but that is not Alexa's fault. Also, it is a bit creepy what this speaker is \"hearing\" in our household but to be honest I don't really think anyone would care about our personal life as we are as boring as all get out.\n\nOverall, despite my initial qualms this speaker is everything to me, and I can't wait to purchase more.

Aside from using it as just a Bluetooth speaker it is more of a novelty than anything. Sound quality is decent for a small speaker playing music, although the first day I using it the play back got all staticy and distorted and I had to unplug and re-plug it in to get the quality back. I do have to say compared to Siri I think Alexa wins as far as being able to understand, enabling different skills that she can learn, like starting my wifes Chrysler Pacifica, enabling her to be able to understand Pandora, using the Tplink products for controlling our house.

It’s like having an intercom throughout my house.\n- Notifications: really liked being alerted to my Amazon package deliveries\n+ more...\nDislikes:\n- Four times now I’ve had to repeat myself multiple times when turning on & off the ambient sounds. It registers that it hears the command, but nothing plays. Or, it refers to the ambient sounds menu instead of turning off the sound playing.\n- On the 3rd flr it has lost connection twice to my WiFi on the 3rd floor (likely due to the WiFi signal strength). I had to reset the connection in the Alexa app each time, which was annoying.\n- I wish the volume was louder when playing music from my iPhone. I tried it once and ended up just connecting to my sound bar instead. It’s still decent quality sound and apparently improved from previous versions from the reviews that I’ve read.\nSide note: The first time that an Alexa commercial comes on and they activate, it’s pretty hilarious. It also activates when similar words pop up in the background, but I just tell it to shut off.

In each echo dot and/or show you can set the device address/location so it will give you the correct weather for that area and driving and traffic and so on for that location. It is done in the Alexa app, under that device. Overall I give the connectivity and usability a 10. I am still learning the commands and the abilities that you can assign to it, but best of all you can use the 'drop-in' command to talk to any Amazon device - we use it to talk from my house to the store - works just like a phone, and a good way to scare someone if they don't know you can do this.

(Yes, I have the settings set for nearest dot.) Next, no matter what I seem to ask the gen 3 dot except for time and weather, it can never find the answer. It's almost like it has no access to resources. Yet my Echo Dot 2nd gen can find pretty much everything I'm looking for.

I have several, placed in different rooms around my house. As I am going about my day and remember I need to add an item to my shopping list, I simply say, \"Alexa add eggs, milk and cheese to my list.\" and she does. I can retrieve it later at the store, just by opening my Alexa app. There are so many things you can do with Alexa besides making lists and playing music. I also have the Fire Cube, and several smart home controls. They all work together with Alexa seemlessly. So, no more trying to find remotes that never seem to make it back where they are supposed to be. I can turn on my living room cable, TV and sound bar with just one command. Alexa can change channels, turn on lights, ceiling fans and control devices in other rooms with just my voice command. I'm also excited about the future prospects of the beta \"Let's Chat\" social bot. In the future, it may prove to be valuable for persons who are not able to get out, or even the elderly who are lonely.\nI downloaded the IFTT app and the Mastermind app, and now I can even ask her to read and write emails. When I hear the familiar \"ding\" that signifies my phone has received a text, I simply ask her and she will read the text message (my phone can stay in my purse)! That means, I can work at home without the distraction of my cell phone, but still receive important messages. I feel like I have a personal assistant following me around! It is awesome.

I have owned the amazon tap too. I currently have three echo devices and a fire tv. I have and do enjoy all of them. I primarily use the echo devices for smart home voice control but do use them for other things such as music, timers, searching the net for questions and such.\n\nThe new echo dot (3rd gen) is leaps and bounds better than the 2nd gen dot. Setting up is a breeze if you don't have mac filtering turned on your wifi router. This is something that Amazon should make readily available on a sticker on the echo or inside the box or something. That complicated things for my setup. I had to turn off mac filtering to get the dot setup so I could then use the app to get the mac address and then add it to the mac filter and then turn mac filtering back on. If I were able to have the mac address before setting it up, I could have just added it to the filter and then setup would have been way easier for me. Not everyone has this turned on so it may not be an issue for you. Just be aware of this before starting your setup and you'll be fine. The rest is just like any other echo device. Except the sound is leaps and bounds better than its predecessors.\n\nIf you are into echo devices, I would highly recommend this over the older generations of dots.

No, it does not yet do Audible on all devices, so doing this multi-room does not work without setting up Bluetooth speakers, BUT, listening to Audible USED to be... Grab phone, turn on BT, find speaker, turn on speaker, pair with BT speaker, open app, find book, play book. NOW it's: \"Alexa, open audible.\" THAT'S IT. She opens it and resumes the last book played. SO MUCH BETTER, especially for sneaking in just a few minutes of play time while doing dishes.\n\nBetween this and the ECHO, the main difference is how it sounds, and how far away it can hear you.\n\nIf you are just trying home automation for the first time and don't have much money, it's worth grabbing the Echo Dot on sale if you aren't sure you will like it, BUT, the Echo gets about two volume levels higher than the Echo Dot, has a more resounding sound, and it can hear you from farther away.\n\nI suggest that if you think you will like it and you are going to get just ONE device, get the Echo.

AMZ don't publish schematics, but it sounds like a very different op-amp is being used on the output that delivers wider bandwidth and current. The much bigger power supply would back that up.\n\nI'll say that Gen2 had the worst capture and hold of wifi. It overheated a lot, too, and lost connection regularly, even 15' from a high-power wifi router. That is solved here. I have only lost audio when my cable modem is resetting, which is unavoidable.\n\nOtherwise, it seems to work, even with fewer mics. It works like the Gen2 does for controls and is the perfect companion to AMZ Unlimited Music.

Sure, they are almost identical, though it is nice to have the plastic contrast on top of the device. Also, it has additional buttons on top to make its use a lot more convenient at times.\n\nThe light ring around the EchoDot is its most compelling feature against the Google Home Mini, in my opinion. To me, it a much better look.

I'm not sure... we have a..... This is too much and too long. Answers must be as short as possible. Designers really need to work to increase speed for getting results, keep speech simple, remove repetitions, remove all these hmmm and not sure.

When I want to have white noise, or ambient noise through whole night, very often it stop playing in 5 minutes, or in half an hour, or in couple hours. I understand, maybe something wrong was with WiFi, but I don't think it was the reason - another two dots were working without interruption at the time. But even if something happened, why after it's again online, it didn't go on playing?? Nobody told Alexa stop playing.\n3. No possibilities to control dots by Alexa app thru smartphone. It's weird. Really.\n\nI'll add more comments as they appear during usage.\n\nBut for now, as conclusion, this is a raw product which had a lot of things must be improved, and I don't see any reason why they didn't do these improvements by 3rd!!!! generation...

The sound quality has become much more solid and much less tinny. The large Echo units are certainly much better, but these are nice to have around where space is tight. They are also really easy to hide behind lamps. I only docked a star because it took me about six attempts to connect to wifi. That was super annoying because it does not do that quickly to begin with. That sixth attempt connected finally. The device also kept stating that it was \"not registered.\" There are two methods to pair the Echo Dot and get it linked within the Alexa app. If you purchased the device directly from Amazon, make sure you pair it from the list of devices already on your Device list in the app. You new, unconnected one will already be listed there. If you attempt to pair it by just clicking + and adding the device itself, the platform is not smart enough to realize you are pairing it to its existing account. So, it thinks it is someone else trying to connect it, thereby making it think it's \"not registered.\" All set now, just not a 5-star experience (four echos)."},{"reviewerName":"Terelynn","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Why did I wait so long to try this awesome little dot???","reviewDate":"January 17, 2019","reviewText":"The Echo Dot...not a hugely impressive name for such a neat little item!

I love how all I have to do is say, \"Alexa, play music\", and she will choose something random or I can request a specific artist or song. I don't have to reach out of the shower to mess with my playlist on my phone or to change the volume or anything else...I just ask Alexa! There are so many different things Alexa can do for you, from organizing your day to setting alarms and calling people on your contact list, to so much more! My grandson is having a blast with it just asking random questions and was very impressed when she told a knock-knock joke last night! On the other hand, this device could possibly drive you crazy if you have someone that constantly interrupts what is playing to ask her questions or change music.

So I purchased Alexa.\nIt has been WONDERFUL. Sometimes I feel a little mean, so I say please to her, but I am constantly bossing her around. Alexa play my Spotify music. Alexa call my mom. Alexa skip this song. etc. I easily switch her from room to room depending on what I am doing (cooking, showering, cleaning etc). She re-connects by herself within a minute after unplugging her. Every now and then I realize that she either stops working or doesn't understand me, but I finally figured out why- when something is on like my microwave, and she is near it (like when I was cooking), she momentarily stopped working. But as soon as the microwave stopped, she continued playing my music. I don't mind that, I get the electromagnetic waves and signals and whatnot. I like her, and she also keeps me company. I am excited to start using her to turn my lights on and off without getting out of bed at night (who else fears the little toe trolls on the floor running from your light switch back to your bed!?)

At some point in there, I also tried the 2nd-gen Dot, but I ended up selling that one because I couldn't stand how weak and tin-y the speaker sounded--I wasn't expecting it to be great for music (you can connect external speakers to both that and this generation), but I was expecting it to still be good for alarms/timers and whatnot. Unfortunately, that was not the case for the 2nd gen.\n\nEnter the third generation: it's a little bigger, but the speaker is SO much better. It's not quite as good as my full-size Echo for music, but it's impressively good for its size. Unlike the previous generation, it also does produce alarm/timer sounds that sound full and loud, not weak and full of treble only (i.e., if this were my alarm, it would actually wake me up). The power connector also changed to the typical DC \"barrel\" connector over micro USB, presumably to handle the increased power demand of the new speaker (not a problem for me but may be for you if you're hoping to replace a previous gen you had strategically powered).\n\nAs of the time of my writing, the Dots have also frequently either been on sale or bundled cheaply as a promo with other items.

I use it primarily for input and use Bluetooth 2.1 speakers for output. Adding skills is fun and increases the device's smarts. Amazon doesn't support the same wake words across Fire HD and Echo Dots. It's probably because they have different development teams that don't often speak or share a vision across platforms. We use \"Echo\" for a wakeword and that is not supported on the Fire HD 10 to get to \"Alexa\". If you use it for home control, you will get tired of Alexa's \"OK\" response. Amazon could mix it up a bit with OK, Done, As you wish, (your name here, voice recognized). There is surprisingly very little use of learned household names (associated to learned voices) on the account which makes \"Alexa\" seem a lot less personable. Even in a household environment with learned voices, Amazon is quick to remind you who controls the household account (Prime account holder name). This is unfortunate as households often share accounts. So, Alexa tells you that the Prime owner in the household was the one to last listen to a station on TuneIn even when it was another household member that requested it and last listened to it. Aside from those quirks, which should get programmed out, the Echo Dot 3rd Gen is great to listen to music and radio as you move from room to room around the house, or just need the temperature and forecast when getting ready to go out.

It's pretty easy to set up.\n\nBut from the marketing, I expected it to be able to answer questions like Google and Apple. It really cannot. There are basically two reasons.\n\nWhile Alexa understands predictable commands like \"Set a timer for 10 minutes.\" It cannot understand more complicated questions as well as Apple Siri, which itself is primitive compare to Google's English language interpretation.\n\nThe other reason is that it can only synchronize with three different mail servers.

My 3rd Gen Dot’s sound is significantly better then my other 2nd gen Dots! My new 3rd Gen fills my large frontroom with music/sound. In fact it can be heard from other adjacencent rooms too! The new Dot is pretty close in the level of sound that my 2nd gen show puts out, which is really quite loud! Honestly from the reviews I read about the 3rd Gen dot I almost didn’t buy them thinking the volume of sound wouldn’t be near loud enough comparing them to the 2nd Gen Dots I already own that are not all that loud. But I’m glad I took the chance and bought 2 of these 3rd Gen Dots, cause they do sound amazing and are more then plenty loud. BTW, that’s coming from a old cabinet maker that’s had his hearing lost significantly from using loud equipment for decades! If I can more then easily hear these, then anyone with normal hearing certain can too! If their not loud, try turning up your volume on your Dot! Personally I can’t say one bad thing about these new 3rd Gen Dots, I’m very impressed! My old 2nd gen Dots are now in our bathroom paired to our new ceiling vents that have Bluetooth speakers. Perfect use of my 2nd gen Dots! No need for extra Bluetooth speakers on my 3rd Gen Dots, plenty of bass for me and you can adjust your bass, etc. on your Alexa app too! Unless you’re wanting ear bleeding sound, you won’t be disappointed with the 3rd Gen Dots!"},{"reviewerName":"Margarita","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"It's like having a personal assistant!","reviewDate":"June 18, 2019","reviewText":"I love my Echo Dot! I can go about my day and don't have to stop what I'm doing to look stuff up or write things down. I just wake Alexa and ask her to: calculate a measurement for a recipe; set a timer for my wash or dryer cycle; add something to my grocery list; or just a remind me to do something at a later time.\n\nThere's a small learning curve to know the correct terms, like instead of \"turn off\" use \"stop\" when I'm done hearing music. Or sometimes I'll say \"dining\" in my command and she'll ask \"did you mean dining.\" And I also have to remember to say Alexa for each different command.\n\nIt's actually been fun learning how to use my Echo Dot and how to set up routines that make life easier: for instance, when I say Alexa good night, it triggers the smart plug of the lamp next to me off and turns the smart plug of my lamp on my night table on. I've also set my porch lights and back yard lights on a daily schedule using smart bulbs. No more turning the porch lights on when we're leaving before dusk if we're returning after dark."},{"reviewerName":"Autumn Rowan","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"How did I live without this just three months ago?","reviewDate":"March 17, 2019","reviewText":"I love my Echo. I’m having surgery next month and I set two of these up to control smart outlets in the living room and bedroom so I can control lights without having to get up. I really like the ability to set alarms and timers. I use one when I’m baking and another one for getting up in the morning. I have a routine set where the alarm goes off and then it turns on a light. A bonus from the smart plugs that has nothing to do with the Echo is that I can turn on lights in the house from my phone while I’m driving home (although Echo can be used to set up a routine for those as well).\n\nOne thing I didn’t realize is that you have to be connected to the internet for any of them to work. The speech recognition engine is not hosted on the local machine. I live in a remote area where the internet goes down from time to time. It would be nice if Amazon would enable some basic features like alarms to run internally.\n\nI was impressed with the sound; my Echo pushes noticeably more base than my Oontz Angle.

It's as if they think they can spend $25-$50 on a device and get the equivalent sound quality of a multi hundred dollar speaker system - be real. It's much fuller than 2nd gen and the bass is actually noticeable, but it's not a multi hundred dollar speaker.

It was my intention to it replace the first generation Dot, but I changed my mind on that very quickly. When Alexa speaks, she sounds super muffled. It sounds like she’s wrapped in a blanket. I’ve only played a few songs and they don’t sound terrible, but I find that I have to turn the volume way up to hear her, and if I forget to turn it down again, whatever I play is way too loud. My conversations with her have gone like this:\n\nMe: Alexa - Set volume to six. Alexa, what is the weather?\nAlexa: The weather in blah blah is blah blah blah blah. (Loud, but muffled).\nMe: Alexa, set volume to three. Alexa, play blah blah by the blah blah blahs\n\nWithout the first and third step, it’s completely unusable.\n\nIt is also one of the most deaf of my Echo devices.

After weeks and multiple trials, frustrated, I posted a one star review, got call from Amazon on my voicemail next day with an offer to help, came home and plugged the thing in again (just to make sure it still did not work before I called back) - and it worked!

I ran into so many problems pairing Alexa to my Bluetooth Phillips hue bulbs- customer service agents have no idea what they’re talking about and kept insisting I needed a hub, despite the product set up stating everywhere that a hub is not required. After being insulted and purposely disconnected from chat support, I was able to figure it out on my own- proving that I in fact did not need a hub. Moving to the next issue- the 4K firestick. Alexa recognizes the device and will boot up the tv and play shows when you ask- however once you attempt to power on or off the tv, she suddenly has no idea what device you’re talking about and claims it does not exist. Clearly some issues with echo Alexa connecting to other devices properly. No point in talking to tech support about it either because they obviously don’t know their own products and will just insist you need to buy something else to connect them."},{"reviewerName":"William D.

Read that the Dot didn't have the same sound quality as the full-size Echo, but my previous Bluetooth speaker was an itty bitty, cheap, inch-high pocket-size thing, so I figured surely the sound quality would be at least as good as that one was (it had surprisingly crisp, clear sound for such a tiny thing). I was wrong. The music sounds weird and muffled on the Dot, like someone tossed a heavy blanket over the speaker; not even close to decent quality, and trying to adjust the bass/treble didn't improve things. Furthermore, it won't link to my Spotify account, as it apparently requires you to have Spotify *Premium*, which I have no interest in paying for, and this bit of fine print was not mentioned anywhere in the item description when I bought it. So basically, it is completely useless for the entire purpose I bought it for. I initially figured that if I didn't like the Dot, I'd return it and save for the full-size Echo, but as that one presumably won't let me listen to my free Spotify account either, I think I am just going to return it and go with a regular old, non-smart Bluetooth speaker instead -- one that will let me listen to what I want, with decent sound quality and no stipulations. Very disappointing... I was really looking forward to using this.

It was a straightforward setup along with connecting it to the smart lighting, coming from someone who didn't grow up with technology.

The speaker is plenty loud for my small space (900sq ft total), but there is some distortion to music at higher volumes, which, for me, is to be expected for something so little (about 4 1/2 to 5 inch across). I keep it In my kitchen, it can hear me from my bedroom down a 15 foot hallway if I have the door open, and not if the door is closed (I'm fine with that as I dont really want a potentially open mic in my bedroom or bathroom).

It does not like to be paired. Even though my Alexa app shows it is properly connected, over the past couple of weeks, the Dot has disconnected without my doing anything. The second problem is that if I have a Bluetooth device activated anywhere nearby - and that has proven to be a pretty large area - the Dot does not connect to my Alexa Everywhere group.\n\nAs a result of those two issues, I have docked my Echo Dot (third generation) one star."},{"reviewerName":"Amy M Vichaidit","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Love love love my new echo dot!","reviewDate":"July 19, 2019","reviewText":"I have not bought any Amazon made products in a while.

I actually bought the Gen3, so I could move the Gen2 from center stage (our Rec Room) to our bedroom, move the Show to center stage, and use the Gen3 in our Living Room. Well, when I made the Show center stage, I soon discovered it's useless, unless you interact with it from 2 feet away (something I didn't realize because it was always on my office desk right in front of me).

The key feature I have been using this with is Amazon Music but ask it to play a certain genre and it won't play anything but the same six songs over and over and over again.\n\nThe key integration I was expecting with this was home automation since the Ring Hub of my Ring Alarm (Ring is owned by Amazon) can now work as a Z-Wave hub. However, the software still can't schedule anything yet so there is no point in moving my Z-Wave devices over to the Amazon infrastructure. Who knows when Ring will deploy this feature? It's been over two years as far as I can tell when the Ring community asked Ring to update the software to rotate a video feed from a Ring Doorbell 90 degrees. This was needed in my case if I wanted to install a Ring Doorbell. Thankfully, I was able to return the doorbell in time for a refund.\n\nI'm getting to the point of just putting the Echo Dot up on Let Go and see if anyone wants it.

I have both google and amazon. The differences I notice is that Alexa will ask more specific questions and when you ask or Moreno medical questions it provides very reliable information and sources. Google does not go into as much detail but does seem to be a bit more user friendly. For instance I’ll tell Alexa/google to turn off the lights. Alexa will tell me there is more then one light and wants confirmation to which exact bulb I want to turn off. Google will just turn the lights off. I figured out later that I need to name all my bulbs the same name if I want Alexa to turn them all off. There are other instances where google seems to understand more of what I want and in my opinion seems to be a bit more user friendly however Alexa does have strengths over google such as giving better and more detailed information. The speaker in the google mini seems to sound a bit better but not by too much. Alexa can send messages and can call people through my iPhone. I also like that I have a better selection of music through prime. It’s like a one stop shop. Overall each has its strengths and weaknesses.

This one is slightly bigger but sounds better than the previous generation. My only complaint with this one is the power plug. The 3rd generation no longer comes with a USB adapter and USB to USB-C cord. It now comes with a molded A/C adapter to USB-C power cord. This is annoying because it limits the installation options IMO. A/C power adapters typically take up more room than the average USB power adapter and this one is no exception. Fortunately I bought this unit to replace a 2nd Generation inside my house to then move the 2nd Generation to my pool area. If I had the 3rd generation as my only option it would be a problematic install because outdoor outlets are limited. There is one outlet available to power my TV and any devices I need to connect to the TV. In this particular location I installed a high wattage 4 port USB charger (plugged into the second outlet) which had one open port. The 4 port USB charger is much smaller than any 4 outlet power strip that I would need to power the 4 devices currently plugged into the USB charger. I'm not sure why Amazon felt the need to change to the power cord. The previous gen power configuration worked fine. Just like screen mirroring was a great function on the previous Gen Fire TV but Amazon felt the need to remove it with the new 4K Fire TV.

It also reminds me of stuff I have to do with the reminders feature. And the speakers on this updated version is a HUGE improvement over the last version. My music sounds great from this tiny speaker (obviously not as good as a nicer one but still) in conclusion I would highly recommend and will definitely buy more in the future."},{"reviewerName":"K.

It connected effortlessly to my home wifi and now it practically runs the show! My 1940's home is slowly becoming a \"smart\" home as I add gadgets that work with my Amazon Echo Dot - who says you can't teach an old dog new tricks! Like turning on lamps by asking Alexa to do it and finding the perfect music for just about every occasion - instantly. Sometimes Alexa gets a little annoyed when my family barks commands at \"her\" - she knows just the right phrase to put everyone in their place. Very quick come-backs - you almost forget you are talking to a computer. Alexa has become part of the family. Don't know how we got along with out her! We even took her along on a recent vacation. My radio isn't very happy and neither is the stereo system. Maybe I'll get a smart plug so that the Echo Dot can bring them up to speed. If you're thinking about dipping your toes into the smart pool, start with the Echo Dot.

My wife and I were staying with some people and we used our Alexa everyday we were there. We use it to play music while we are getting ready, rain sounds while we are sleeping, or classical music for our dog Olivia when we are away. Anyway, this family we were staying with never used Alexa before. My wife decided to show them the device and their son really fell in love with it, he's one years old, and he is the reason I need another one. These people were so happy to see their son trying to say Alexa and watching him dance to different songs. My wife offered MY ALEXA to those people, and they accepted! I was so sad to leave her behind. Once we left, I would shout Alexa randomly in my own home and no one answered! I finally demanded that we get another one, so here we are.

HUGE SOUND IMPROVEMENTS OVER 2ND GEN. But Alexa's not for everyone.","reviewDate":"December 6, 2018","reviewText":"While this is a great Bluetooth speaker and overall I love using this device to play Amazon music unlimited and for the occasional Wikipedia reference, I'll be the first to admit that ALEXA STILL HAS A LONG WAY TO GO TO CATCH UP TO GOOGLE ASSISTANT IN TERMS OF EASE OF USE AND CONVERSATIONAL SKILLS, PLUS ACCESSIBILITY OF INFORMATION. When it comes to what is the better speaker this or the Google home mini, this wins hands down. I can say that confidently because I have both. What is the better device? Well that depends on you. And which company's services do you have, if either of theirs? Personally I have both Google play music and Amazon Prime account and additionally I have an Amazon music unlimited account - BUT I only have the Amazon music unlimited account because I have the devices that use it, but the side benefit now is that I get to use it on my phone through the Alexa app and through the Amazon music app. Before I was strictly using Google play music, which was sufficient but sucked on the voice control side comparatively, at least by phone. Anyways with both companies' services being paid for, it makes a straight-up comparison of the Google Home vs Amazon Echo easy and for the Google Home Mini vs the Amazon Echo THIRD GEN, the comparison is REALLY EASY. THIS IS A BETTER DEVICE THAN THE GOOGLE HOME MINI IF YOU KNOW HOW TO USE IT, ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE ALREADY A PRIME MEMBER, AND REALLY THE CASE IF YOU PAY FOR AMAZON MUSIC UNLIMITED WHICH YOU CAN PAY FOR EVEN IF YOU AREN'T A PRIME MEMBER. My aunt still I think summed it up best when she told me one day, \"Alexa or Amazon devices are the best for Entertainment [AND SOUND QUALITY, AS IS, COMPARATIVELY] but Google devices are better at getting information [i.e. question-answering using natural language]\". But the sound difference between the 3rd generation dot and the 2nd generation dot is TREMENDOUSLY NOTICABLE to me. Every second generation Echo dot in my house has a additional speaker attached to it, but neither of the two 3rd generation dots, I feel, require an additional speaker - for adequate sound volume w/o loss of clarity. Remember if you want a search engine, choose Google. If you want Alexa's features, then these are currently my recommendation for the best value device for that. Plz see attached videos for more of what I mean and for demonstrated points."},{"reviewerName":"Clarissa Dng","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Cool if it's free","reviewDate":"September 3, 2019","reviewText":"I got my Echo as a \"gift with purchase\" when I got a new Insignia TV at Best Buy (August 2019), which is the only reason I even have an Echo Dot. I had no desire/need for it, but it's been a fun addition. I don't use it to its potential, partially because I'm not used to it and forget about it even being on my nightstand, but the few tricks I resort to are nice (morning routine/alarm, light and TV switch on-off, weather forecasts).\nThe biggest thing was having to figure out what each color ring means - yes, there's several colors and speed associated with different notifications/status of the device. That's kind of a pain, as you have to memorize them all or pull up the help section on your phone every time the device lights up without being prompt to. I have had a few issues when I had to log out of my amazon account on my tv and log back in - Alexa didn't automatically reconnect to the account, and it took a good 20 minutes for me to figure out what was going on. Voice recognition can be obnoxious too, as sometimes I have to really raise my voice even if I'm in the same room as the device - and people in other rooms can definitely hear me \"yell\" at it \"ALEXA!\"\nOverall, it's a fun little gadget to have around the house. I'm obsessed with its design and have been told you can actually even buy cases/masks for it if you want it a different color/pattern.

And talking about music. I #$%^& HATE iHEART radio (or any traditional over the air radio station for that matter). I will not pay for music streaming from any source when I have thousands of songs already that I normally listen to at home and in the car, Thankfully I can find stuff I like on 'TuneIn' but it's a pain to have to specify the exact channel each and every time I want it to play. And even then, some channels you can only get to by going through the POS mobile phone app. If I ask Echo (the device) to play a certain channel that I was listening to the day before, it says it can't for various reasons. Yet I can turn on wifi on my phone, fire up the app, go though TuneIn and select the channel and it plays fine. If I was playing a certain channel hours before, the day before or days ago when I last listened to music, I should be able to just say \"Echo, play\" and it should play the last station I selected. But it doesn't. It defaults to some crappy country station on IHeart and I hate Country music worse then I hate iHeart radio/over-the-air-radio-stations in general. I hate that it can't go over the net and play internet based stations (like DI.FM) that aren't listed in 'TuneIn\".\nIt's ok for asking about the weather while you're busy running around in what ever room you are in.

She didn't get much use out of because she also got a tablet from her grandma, so it has kind of just been in her room for my convenience when I'm cleaning in there or putting away laundry. Last weekend I was listening to it, and not loud, mind you, because we live in an apartment and unless I'm singing to something, I'm past the point where loud music is my thing. Anyway, about a half hour after the first song, it started sounding like a stereo does when the speaker is blown. I couldn't believe it! My Echo has never given me a problem and my daughter and her friend have played that thing so loud it couldn't hear them to turn the volume back down. I was irritated that this had broken so quickly, but I got distracted and forgot to do anything about it for about a week. Just in case, I turned it on again and it sounded completely normal. I thought it was just a fluke and maybe I'd been tired and hearing things. However, about a half-hour in, it did the same thing again. Just to test something, I turned it off and turned it back on a minute later. It was fine again, but didn't last that way for a half-hour that time.\n\nBasically, in order to use this, I'm going to have to continually turn it off and turn it back on and when it gets to the point where the normalcy is only lasting a minute or two, I'll have to turn it off completely and let it \"recharge\" itself. I'm not sure if this is a common problem or not, but I'm extremely disappointed it didn't even last a month, especially when it was barely used and was definitely not mishandled, as it never left my daughter's dresser.\n\nI've never had an Amazon product break like this before, so I'm not sure what the process is here. I would like a replacement, though, still having some hope that I just received the dud in the batch of ones that worked as they should.\n\nI wouldn't not recommend this to someone else, but I might revise this later if the second one doesn't at least make it through the end of the warranty."},{"reviewerName":"Captain Packrat","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Much improved sound over the 2nd gen Dot","reviewDate":"December 28, 2018","reviewText":"I have several of the 2nd gen Echo Dots. Because they are inexpensive, I've used them in places where they might become damaged, such as in the barn or garage, and because they're small, I've also used them in the bathroom. But the sound was very lacking, requiring the volume to be turned all the way up in even a small bathroom to hear adequately, and the sound was tinny and dull. I had to buy a cheap set of computer speakers for the barn and garage because the volume was utterly inadequate for such a large, open space.\n\nThe 3rd gen Dot fixes a lot of the sound issues. I bought one to replace the unit in the bathroom. Now music sounds much better, and I only have to set the volume to about 4 or 5 (out of 10) to hear clearly. I haven't tried it out in the barn or garage, but I suspect it might have enough volume to use without external speakers.\n\nThe only down sides I've seen so far is that the new version is slightly bigger around, so it won't fit into any 2nd gen wall brackets, and currently there are very few 3rd gen brackets and they tend to be fairly expensive ($17 for a plastic 3rd gen mount vs $5 for a metal 2nd gen mount).

It sounds MUCH better than the previous models; in fact, it sounds almost as good as a full-size generation 2 Echo, just with less bass. For audio where the bass isn't as important (e.g. classical orchestra, audiobooks, or voice calls), I don't even notice the difference in bass unless I'm thinking about it.\n\nPut another way, the 3rd-gen Dot sounds good enough that your average user probably won't feel the need to connect it to an external speaker.\n\nThe third generation is also much better looking than the second generation, due to the fabric cover. It looks classy just about anywhere you put it.\n\nMy only major complaint is that the Echo Dot's microphones aren't as good as the full-size Echo. The 2nd-gen Echo has 7 microphone holes and can understand me no matter where I am, how much background noise there is, or how loudly I'm talking. The 3rd-gen Echo Dot, on the other hand, only has more microphone holes, and seems to have trouble hearing me if I'm too far away, not facing it directly, or there is too much background noise (including noise coming from its own speakers).\n\nI do think the standard retail price of $50 is a bit of a ripoff, but the sale price of $30 is a good value."},{"reviewerName":"gml118","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Compared to echo gen 1, it's MILES better!","reviewDate":"August 18, 2019","reviewText":"I use my Echo Dot primarily while I'm in the shower to check the time, weather, and play trivia games like Jeopardy.

Your service sent out another unit, however, this is an inherent design flaw, not a one-off defect. The replacement was as blurry as the original."},{"reviewerName":"SunGodEyeRa","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"ECHO DOT 3 IS AMAZING!!!","reviewDate":"March 21, 2019","reviewText":"I really like the echo dot 3. You can use it in smaller rooms without a separate speaker or you can add a bluetooth or audio cable directly to a speaker.\nThe sound quality out of it's own speaker is not jaw dropping. Truthfully, the sound is ok. At low volume or high volumes it gives acceptable audio. When connected to an external speaker then the quality sounds as good as your speaker can sound (or as bad).\nThe look is much better than the previous echo dot 2 and comes in 3 different colors.\nI use money to control several smart devices ( light bulbs, humidifier/aromatherapy, smart plugs, Nest thermostat,etc). All of these work flawlessly with the echo dot 3. Non of my devices require a hub, so for the $49 you get a lot. It can answer many question, although not as many as the google home mini. You can play games on it like Jeopardy. It can tell you jokes, play music of course and much more. All you need do is add the equipment (bulbs, thermostat, etc) and allow the skill in the Amazon Echo App.\nI use mine every single day without fail. In fact I now have 1 in nearly every room in my house.\nYou can also control any of the other echos that you have from any other echo. You can also play the same song on all echoes if you choose. So if you are are walking in and out of other rooms you can continue to hear the same song. The only thing that could make this better is a little bit richer sound from the internal speaker (which, again isn't bad). However, to do that, I am certain that a price increase would be involved. I think $49 is a fantastic price and not to hard to swallow if you want to get multiple units like I have."},{"reviewerName":"shoelaceninja","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Off to a good start.","reviewDate":"May 16, 2019","reviewText":"I bit the bullet and bought one for s**ts and giggles along with some cheap legelite smart bulbs. The only light source in my bedroom is my ceiling fan lights, and the pull cord broke on it years ago. So I have to unscrew the bulbs by hand to turn off my lights but keep the fan on.\n\nNot anymore. The echo was a quick setup. The bulbs arrived a day later and were setup within minutes. I can use my voice to turn on and off my lights now; I can set brightness per bulb or group name by voice, change color, etc.\n\nI dig the routines so you can customize responses, actions, or sequences of actions. You can even further install skills directly from the amazon website or within the app to further increase the dot's capabilities. Or you can create your own or customize existing simple templates.\n\nI like the alarms best. With two jobs, one with different hours each day I work, I love the ability to add yet another set of alarms to wake me up. My favorite feature of this is the ability to say \"set an alarm for one hour\" if you wanna just plop down for a nap without having to make or edit an alarm on your phone.\n\nOne thing I'd like to see is some more phone app integrations, something standardized and easy for app developers to integrate. One of my favorite android apps to use before bed is Calm. I'd like the ability to integrate a specific guided sleep meditation as part of a sleep routine on the dot.\n\nThe sound quality is great for what it is. While not sufficiently bassy, it can rumble and vibrate a whole table at full volume.\n\nIt's relatively responsive to my voice. I can say \"echo\" and wake it even when netflix is playing at talking volume but it won't recognize what I'm saying if netflix has talking while I speak. It will pick up my voice across my bedroom at around 10 feet away.\n\nOverall I'll probably upgrade to the plus model in the future and add in more smarthome things. The whole automation aspect isn't really of use to me but just having the voice control is pretty nifty."},{"reviewerName":"Mallory","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great sound for the size","reviewDate":"July 5, 2019","reviewText":"I think other reviews have covered the many pros and cons of this device over others, so I’ll just reiterate how this compares to the two others I own. Compared to Borge the second gen dot and to the Spot, the sound quality of this device is much louder and more dynamic. We have been really impressed by it after. Wing used to listening to music on the other two Alexa devices. We had even purchased a Bluetooth speaker to use with the second generation dot, but it is absolutely unnecessary to use with the third generation. The Spot’s audio is fine, but lacks the depth of the 3rd gen Dot.\nThis unit is a bit larger than the previous generations, but it’s worth the extra counter space. It otherwise works just like the others, with no other issues in terms of Alexa integration or voice recognition. That technology is continually evolving, so we are consistently seeing advances in how we can interact with and be better understood by Alexa.

Got it on sale for $29. Would’ve been pissed if I paid 50 for this. It seems like it has a lot of skills. But trying to get them all to work is another story. It is very complicated to set up the skills to get your TV to work with it or your Amazon fire stick to work properly with that. Anything but setting up the very basics is extremely difficult at least for me it is so I would assume for others it is to . Right now the only thing I can do with it is play music call and text my friends ask weather and turn on tv. If I ask to launch Netflix or something like that forget it it always says I don’t know how to do that one time and then the very next time it’ll do it and I had made no changes so what’s going on here. Please simplify your products Amazon. Just like the only music I can play from this device is Amazon music. I really wanted to buy your second generation echo deluxe is with the woofer I believe it was about 350 Dollars but when I discovered all I could do is play music from Amazon forget it why can’t I play music from my sources.

It has a more modern look with a nice material finish on the outside so that it looks less like a hockey pick and more of a well-designed device. I love the customization options for it, the designs look well made and smooth, but I wish they would add more there's only 3 when there are so many colors out there! It doesn't seem like you can take off the outside cover on it; so you'd have to buy it from a third party. It's also slightly bigger than its other models but it's not something noticeable.\n\n**Setup**\nIt is not powered by a micro USB like the previous model instead it comes with a power adapter that you plug into a wall. This removes a lot of freedom such as plugging it into a computer or using another form of power. Having that accessibility is important because you want to give the customers all the freedom they can. With a micro USB, you don't have to worry about having to plug it away from where exactly you want it. The way it is set up is by the Alexa app. The setup is relatively simple but for me, it took longer than expected as I would be connected to the wifi it was on but it would not give me any further steps. It wasn't a big deal but I thought it was worth mentioning.\n\n**Performance**\nIt has great functionality it is useful for hooking up to devices such as smart lights, door locks, etc. It can read notifications off your phone with the voice command, control other devices, listen to music, play games, make phone calls, and a plethora of other stuff. It also has an audio jack for you to connect speakers to if you do not like the built-in speaker. You can get traffic updates, weather information, and you can even connect multiple echo devices. It is very useful for example, if mom is in the kitchen and the food is done, she can announce the food is done via her voice and let an announcement out to inform others. This is very useful for when you're far away in the house making it convenient instead of having you walk you the designated person. It has functionality that you can use. The echo dot also has skills. One example of an of a skill is the find my phone skill. Doing this will let Alexa make a phone call to your phone which can be used if you cannot find your phone.\n\n*What I dislike *\nOne thing I very dislike is the fact it doesn't hear me quite often. I'll be 10 yards away and I have to yell for it to hear me which is very annoying. I have to be very close to it to hear me; this is a very big let down for me. Now the music. You can only play off of a radio station or have a subscription to pay to Amazon. However, on the Google home mini, you can play music off of Google Play Music for free. I do not think it should be so difficult for these smart speakers to force us to buy a subscription for such a single task.\n\n*You should get a Google home mini instead*\n\nThe google mini has more customizations, for starters, you can edit the voice from many different choices. You can choose from male and female, and even different accents. On alexa, you cannot change the female voice which limits users by a lot. The Google mini looks better and has mostly the same functionality as the Alexa.\n\nThis is a good device and is very useful. If you plan to get it I'm sure you'll love it and it'll be very useful, however, when you look closer into the details, you'll see its competitor can be the better device."},{"reviewerName":"Diana Barkley","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Makes life easier","reviewDate":"June 7, 2019","reviewText":"I'm really enjoying my Echo Dot Smart Speaker with Alexa. I am truly amazed at what all you can do with this device. The first night I hooked it up, I was able to get her to recognize my voice out of a group of people. Now I only bought myself one, but if you buy multiples, you are supposed to be able to link them and you can use them sort of like an intercom system to talk to people in another room. You can also do things like have her to make a shopping list, look things up online, play playlists or the thing that really blew my mind....play games!! Yes she will play games with you! You can choose from kids games, adult games, family games, single player, multiplayer, game show games... the list goes on and on! This entertained my older kids for the longest! I even tried it out myself and had a blast. There are still so many things I have yet to try, but I'm already impressed. Now, a few things I wasn't so impressed with is the fact that its not rechargeable. You can unplug it and take to another room with you. Also, there are things you try to ask Alexa to look up, and you have to ask several different ways before she knows how to get an answer for you. Then, there are times you have to get pretty close and loud for her to hear you, but other times, not so much. Those are really the only things I have complaints about.

So here are some of the pros and cons I noticed as compared to previous generation echo dot:\n\nPros:\n\n1.Sound quality (alexa sound or music or news) is much, much better and deeper, richer in the new echo dot. The bass is is definitely an upgrade - plus with the larger body, I think it has bigger speakers - so the sound produced is much nicer.\n\n2. Form Factor: The fabric exterior casing is definitely a huge plus, as it is more soothing to the eye than the plastic casing for the previous gen echo dot.\n\nCons\n\n1. Alexa responsiveness: The new echo dot has 4 ( I think) microphones, as compared to 8 on the previous generation echo dot. I have noticed that Alexa is not as responsive and takes more time to pick up voice commands.\n\n2. The blue ring on the top much more jittery when you say alexa (it moves in an awkward manner when you call alexa and the light blue portion of the blue rings adjusts to where you are speaking from). Definitely a more awkward, less responsive Alexa.\n\n3. Size: Its way bigger than the previous echo dot, while the fabric casing is a plus, the size, in my opinion, the previous gen echo dot was better\n\nOverall: This echo dot is great - the only thing that is lacking is sufficient microphones so that Alexa responsiveness is as good as the previous gen echo dot"},{"reviewerName":"Heather","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Seriously you will be addicted just buy 5 and get it over with, yea it's that good!","reviewDate":"July 11, 2019","reviewText":"Wow!

Occasional rounds of Jeopardy or 20 Questions are good for entertainment, and quick checks on the weather report and traffic conditions for my work commute come in handy.

I purchased this as part of a package deal when I ordered two Sengled bulbs (color). It was basically a situation of getting just the Sengled bulbs, or getting the bulbs and the echo for a few bucks (less than ten but I don't remember exactly), so it was a no brainer for me.\n\nThis little speaker has a much better sound than it's predecessor. It has deeper and richer tones. It hits more highs and does better with the lows, but is by no means a replacement for a sub if you're looking for deep bass. The dot does everything as advertised. I often use it for checking on the weather and travel before I head out. I take a train into work and it saves me the effort of whipping out my phone and checking an app. I have also used this speaker to check on order statuses, which is quite helpful if I don't have ready access to a laptop.\n\nI also, of course, use these devices to power on other electronics like my Sengled bulbs, the X-Box Ones (Day One Edition and Scorpio), my smart tv (LG OLED B65). The latter requires communication via an app on my smart phone, but it makes getting the lights and TV on the right channel easy before I get downstairs in the morning. It might sound like laziness, but when your rushing to get out the door to work in the morning, it is helpful and has a certain cool factor that I like. I also really like the drop in and broadcast features. If you ever wanted a comm system for your house, this makes it easy to communicate across floors. With our finished basement, we have 4 floors people could be on. Rather than shouting up and down the stairwells, this is a much more civilized alternative.\n\nI can't say these are better than other wireless speakers, say from Google or another manufacturer, as I don't have any of those. I check comparisons on YouTube, and they stack up well to competitors. It all really comes down to your preferences and what \"buy in\" you have with amazon. For example, if you have a prime account, Amazon Music, etc., getting an Echo makes sense.\n\nLong story short, I recommend this speaker. It's better than the 2nd gen, and it has a ton of features I don't even use that would be fun or useful to some. I now have 4 dots in my home, two 2nd Generation kid editions, one 3rd Gen in the living room, and one in the bedroom. I also have a larger 2nd Gen Echo in the kitchen. I might consider buying another for our kids playroom in the basement. At that point I would have at least one on every floor in our house.\n\nI would have given this device 5 stars, but there is room for improvement in the sound department. Also, echo can get confused and mistake words at times. It's a minor gripe though. It might be my voice, my not speaking clearly enough, or background noise (mostly from my kids) which causes this."},{"reviewerName":"Cedrick","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Useful device but sound clarity is terrible.","reviewDate":"February 8, 2019","reviewText":"I like the usefulness and functionality of Echo Dot once it’s set up.

While the small speaker is powerful, Alexa’s voice coming through it isn’t clear at all. I’d estimate that 70% of Alexa’s words can’t be understood unless it’s perfectly quiet and I’m standing near the Echo Dot. —FYI, I have perfect hearing, so it’s not my ears, it’s the muffled sound. I adjusted the equalizer on the app but it has very little effect on the speaker and doesn’t clarify it any at all.\n\nI don’t know what’s inside this Echo Dot but I’d recommend that Amazon start assembling them with a series of tweeters in its circular pattern as well as the current speaker for deeper tones.

It would have been cool if the 3.5mm jack didn't turn off its external speaker. I tried to have it plugged into a stereo but it's not used often. But then we can't hear alexa unless the stereo is on. Another idea would be to allow settings for the jack. Another alexa sits on top of a bass speaker with input Jack's.

But the new Echo Dot (3rd Generation) exceeds expectations on both tasks and looks much more premium than the original to boot.\n\nThe new 3rd generation Echo Dot has a much more elegant look - it's a fabric speaker vs the plastic look of the 2nd generation and has a softer curved design rather than a \"hockey puck\" look. The colors are much more premium as well rather than a glossy/plastic-y white or black. It seems to blend into the background much more rather than stick out when sitting on a table or counter.\n\nThe new 3rd generation also boasts a 1.6\" speaker vs the 1.1\" speaker of the original and more importantly, rather than the \"dots\" on the top which encase the speaker, the new item has a 360 degree speaker around the edges. With the first use, the sound comes out noticeably fuller compared to the old and music sounds much better.\n\nFor anyone considering an \"upgrade\" to the 3rd generation from the 1st or 2nd, I think it's a no brainer.

I don't have a newspaper, TV, or radio so I never knew the weather forecast. Now I can ask Alexa for today's weather or next Sunday's weather. I also use it to set timers. I have so many projects that I need to watch the time carefully for each one. Now I can set multiple timers to keep me on track.\n\nThe best feature is the ability to set reminders days in advance. I can say, \"Set a reminder for Tuesday at 5:30 p.m. to do the laundry.\" Friday night I plan my weekend and set reminders for the entire weekend. It's amazing. I get so much more done because I stay on schedule.\n\nMy friend visited with three of her children to look at things on the internet. I didn't know how to keep the 6-year-old and 12-year-old boys occupied, but Alexa saved the day. I activated the skill Tune In Live which lets you listen to any sporting event for $2.99 a month. The Phillies happened to be playing. The boys were so excited to listen to the game live and ask Alexa questions during the commercials.\n\nThere are so many more skills that I've barely scratched the surface. Wiki How is another great skill. I was hesitant to introduce more technology into my home, but Alexa is so helpful.

The microphone pickup ability on these is also better than the 2nd generation, but still not perfect. I definitely still find myself yelling at Alexa to stop, or repeating commands at the top of my lungs because she can't hear over the TV or something. Definitely worth the extra money to buy this one over the 2nd generation. If they'd somehow manage to perfect what Alexa can hear over other noise I'd be 100% happy and give 5 stars.

I had AT&T and several plugs and some light bulbs couldn't find the internet. My signal is too weak in my house. They said I get a 6ghz signal I could max out my signal at 10 but it wouldn't produce a significant difference. So, I have switched to cable for the internet. Now, the signal can be found kind of. The changing of the network with Alexa is lacking in simplicity. It searches for ever even after I have found the name. It gives the device it's own network name that \"isn't connected to the internet\", and no explanation as to why that happens and what it's purpose is, so you can't help it along. I got it connected with shear luck. But, this morning I heard my husband tell Alexa to turn on the TV and she did nothing, but responded with OK. This is a learning process. I hope I become an expert soon. I have several other things I would like to make smart. We are starting off small. The plug that works practically seamlessly is Amazon Smart Plug.

The plug on it is not USB but rather a BIG SQUARE PLUG that overlaps the next outlet on the power strip so I can’t use that outlet for something else. Why in this day and age would a company like Amazon produce this BIG FAT PLUG? They have produced all kinds of wonderful products with a USB with a removable plug so the product can be plugged via USB into a multiple USB charger or directly into its own plug. It appears this product’s clumsy, oversized plug is from the past and it’s ironic that it’s attached to an item of new technology. If it must have a regular electrical plug, they could streamline the size of it.\n\n2) In addition to the Echo Dot, I also own an Amazon Fire Stick that my daughter bought me for my birthday last June (2018). The assistant wake-up name is Alexa. Since the Fire Stick and the Echo Dot are used in my bedroom, I went to change the Echo Dot’s wake-up name to “Dot” but that wasn’t an option. I had to name it Echo. It would be nice to be able to use the app to change the wake-up name to almost any name you want. I can only imagine how this works for people who have 6 or 8 Echo Dots!

After some back & forth with amazon support, they swapped out my unit, and upon connecting the replacement I noticed that the light ring changes its brightness depending on the amount of ambient light present. There is no mention of this feature anywhere, and amazon wouldn’t confirm that it has this feature, but I can plainly see the difference when I turn on or off a desk lamp which shines right over the echo dot.\n\nThis is a welcome feature improvemnt over the previous generation, as the light ring become less obnoxious at night, but I wish this was a feature I could turn on or off with the app, or had some control over the sensitivity, as it can be hard to see the light ring if it’s dimmed too much.\n\nOther than this one issue and the overly large wall adapter, it’s a great upgrade over the previous generation."},{"reviewerName":"Melanie","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Like 2nd generation better","reviewDate":"May 9, 2019","reviewText":"This is a great speaker if you are using it primarily to listen to music.

It's microphone doesn't work well at all. When you set an alarm, it's hard to turn it off, because it doesn't hear you.

The 2nd gen version may not have the greatest sound, but it's clear and reproduces the highs and midrange quite well. For the lows you wouldn't expect much since it's such a small speaker. Still, it's acceptable. The 3rd gen Echo Dot sounds completely muddy. Speach sounds like the speaker has a sock in their mouth, or a mouth full of food. Music, similarly, is completely lacking in the highs. The midrange is muddy as can be and the lows are not really any better than the 2nd gen Dot. I have two of the 2nd gen dots that I use in small rooms. I have a 3rd gen dot that I tried using on it's own but finally couldn't stand it any longer. I disconnected it until I can get a speaker to hook up to it. I'd even returned one of the 3rd gen Dots, thinking it had to be damaged or something. The replacement sounds exactly like the first - terrible. It's funny to read reviews on some of the tech websites. They all say the same thing, using almost the exact same words, to say that the 3rd gen Dot has much improved sound. It doesn't, and no amount of adjusting the equalization inside the app will do much to help. Maybe there are other things about it that are better. I don't know, I only use it for music, an occasional notification, checking the weather, and similar light duty. If you're going for the 3rd gen Dot for music, you'll want to attach a speaker to it - unless you really can't hear very well anyway."},{"reviewerName":"Jackie","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Echo Dot changed my life","reviewDate":"March 8, 2019","reviewText":"I am the type to honestly purchase new electronics and end up selling them because of lack of use.

One set up to wi-if no problem and has worked great since. The second one, I had to try several times to connect, before I was successful. But it did not stay connected and all I could get out of it was a \" I'm having difficulties at this time, please try later\" response. At times it would just start talking without even being prompted.Then it might work for a week or so before it wouldn't do anything. I reached out to customer service via chat. That chat lasted over thirty minutes only to be \" disconnected \" before problem resolved. Again I reconnected going thru all the steps. Week later it didn't stay connected, so I called and talked to a \" electronic specialist \". That call was over half an hour long. I tried requesting a return shipping label, so I could send it back and get a new replacement since it was a faulty device. I was told that is not an option. I would have to send it back and they would fix it. I responded that I bought a new item and want a new one as a replacement, not a \"FIXED ITEM \" He finally agreed to send out a NEW echo dot and I would have to return the original. A few days later, I received a \"REFURBISHED\" echo dot 3. When I called to speak to a supervisor, I was told that it is their policy to send refurbished ones if a new one is not in \"their stock\". Doesn't matter they have new ones to sell on the website. I told him that I don't except that and it was not what I paid for. And if they are sending out refurbished echos, there must be a huge problem with them. He advised that they test them and to try it out. So I opened the box. All that was in the box was the echo dot. No power source . Again 4th time reaching out to a Tech specialist- supervisor and 45 minutes of phone time. I was told that they only send device out when replacing. And they don't send out any accessories. When was a plug considered an accessory when it is needed to use device. Again I told him that I bought a new device and it was faulty and I wanted a new device as a replacement. Not one that has been fixed. Also I found out that the 90 day warranty did not begin again when the replacement device gets registered. They back date it to the original sell date of first device. So I only had 40 days left on the warranty. Also if you go on line , a refurbished echo goes for $29.99, compared to the $ 49.00 , for a new one. Not once did any representative say that I would be refunded the $20.00 difference for the refurbished echo dot. I told him that this is an AMAZON echo dot. It has their name on the product and they should stand behind their name. I also said if I were to buy a tv from a store and took it home and it quit working, they would replace it with a new tv, not a refurbished one. I will never buy another electronic device that AMAZON sells with their name on it. I will tell all my friends and family that they will get screwed if something goes wrong with their product.

Amazon does not stand behind their products and the consumer whom keeps their business Alive."},{"reviewerName":"Carfo","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Coming from a 2nd gen, this is a nice upgrade","reviewDate":"August 5, 2019","reviewText":"I have two 2nd gen dots in my house and bought this during Prime day.

I also listen to a kindle booK, her voice was clear than 2nd gen. Otherwise it sounds as a real person is speaking. It's not as someone is speaking from a distance. As stated, I ballaced the sound : base, mid, treb to get it sounding smoothly. I am impressed for a good reason. It is something that can be used at a party but also doesn't need to be turned up if used in the kitchen. Keep in mind, the environment does effect the sound so adjust to it.

I wouldn't have bought it for myself, and in fact, I still wouldn't. So I'm probably the last person who should be reviewing it. Or maybe not; having no expectations, maybe I can try to be entirely objective about it. It is unobtrusive in appearance and the power supply wall wart has a decently long cable, so finding a place to situate it is pretty easy. It was very easy to set up, starting with the alexa app on the iPhone, and all adjustments since have been easily accomplished using the device itself. Teaching Alexa to recognize my voice and my wife's was straightforward. It can 'hear' and understand instructions from 10 or more feet away, though getting closer helps if it seems to be having trouble understanding something. Most of the time it understands what it's being asked surprisingly well, though sometimes it's necessary to try a few times to find the right form in which to ask something. Sound quality for such a small device is very acceptable for background or casual listening, though no-one would mistake it for hi-fi. And of course it's mono, unless you pair it with a second one. It is loud enough to be more than adequate in even quite a large room. So as a modern alternative to a boom box for playing music while you do something else, it's very effective. At the moment I have a free trial of Prime Music, but this is frustrating as about 30% of what I ask for isn't available. It would definitely be worth getting the full Amazon Music service if you intend to make more than very intermittent use of it. You can have it tell you jokes and play games; I couldn't care less. You can use it to streamline the shopping process on Amazon; that might be convenient but I'm wary of ceding too much control of that to a relatively autonomous device; I think I'd rather spend the extra time checking what I'm ordering and howg than just saying 'Alexa, order x, y or z', but it may well be possible to set it up so it can't cause too much trouble. So it's a nice toy, and I guess I like having it around because I intend to keep it plugged in and may even try Amazon Music. Has it enhanced my life beyond all recognition? Nope. Not even close. Does it appear to have been nicely designed and to be capable of anything between casual entertainment and some quite useful tasks? Yes, certainly. It's a fun little gadget.

We converse on everything from the nature of the universe to answering questions like can cows swim. People ask, aren't you afraid of \"them\" listening? I answer, I'm not doing or saying anything \"they\" can't hear. There is no secret subversive spy stuff going on in my house, so no, if anything \"they\" probably think we're pretty silly in my household. We play games, run appliances, listen to music, news and ambiance sounds and generally have fun with Alexa. She's become an extension of the house and at times is hilarious. Only occasionally will she give me some off the wall answer that makes me think she tapped into secret government projects (like her answer to my question what's in retinol cream - she gave me answer sounding like she was describing a retina screen) and the men in black will be showing up at my door soon.

This Dot actually puts out some noticeable bass - the 2nd gen had absolutely none. Instead of sounding like an intercom speaker, this one can be used to enjoy music as well as all the other features.\n\nNow, it's not going to replace your larger Echo devices in the sound department, but for putting next to a computer or listening to from the nightstand, this Dot is ideal. I used to love the versatility of the 2nd gen, and still do, but this one has all of that and enough sound to impress.\n\nI purchased the sandstone flavor, and find it to be rather sharp looking, but neutral enough to blend into it's surroundings and not stick out.\n\nBottom line: This is quite an amazing device and a huge value.

I type their names in and state “be good”, “no fighting girls”, or some other message as if they are being watched and they stop what ever bad behavior they are doing.

I like that you can create groups and play music in multiple locations, I just wish you could create multiple different groups with the same dot. example: Our master bedroom and kitchen dot are in a group. Master bedroom is upstairs, and kitchen is downstairs. I like to play music to these 2 while doing laundry and I'm up and down the stairs. I would like a second group with master bedroom and each of the kids bedrooms to play music strictly upstairs when I want. You'd think that would be simple enough but once a dot is part of a group, it can't be part of another group without removing it from the first group.\n\nOtherwise though, we love our Echo Dots and Amazon updates them regularly so there's always new features...

The CONS: I'm annoyed that so much of its abilities and performance are dependant on the Alexa app on your phone. I don't have a new phone so my echo dot is severely limited as to its functionality and abilities. I did check the availability and compatibility of the Alexa app on my phone prior to purchase.

After a 30 minute process they will offer a replacement, so that in a week or so you can go through the return process all over again.\nThe issue is that the Echo Dot 3 is not stable and can not run a bluetooth connection without giving you the red ring of failure.

Sometimes Alexa has no trouble finding my playlists on Amazon Prime, but at other times it cannot find playlists, even when I stand right next to the device, use my best elocution, and ensure that I have the name exactly right by reading it directly from my phone.

Saw no need for one. I became interested when amazon offered these on a discount with amazon music. It was easy to set up. After pairing it with some smart plugs it quickly became useful and convenient. I'm a new convert to the convenience of these things. I use it for music and home automation.\n\nThe Alexa app and permissions still needs some work to make it more user friendly. For example, the account permissions only allow 2 adults in the household to control it with unique logins. Our 18 yr old daughter is legally an adult and has limited account permissions due to Amazon labeling her as a \"teen\". She can't even use the echo to its fullest capacity due to the restrictions Amazon has in place. Fixing this would make it a better experience. There shouldn't be a limit placed by Amazon as to who has what access to Alexa functions. I want better control over that myself.\nIt also took me a few contacts to Amazon support to get our phone numbers attached to the correct account for my wife and me."},{"reviewerName":"Happy2Shop21","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Fantastic, purchased three.","reviewDate":"July 13, 2019","reviewText":"I wasn’t sure if I’d like this at first, but I’m pleasantly surprised by how much I do.

She does not have a prime account and it works perfect for her. I use it to check the weather, my Amazon Prime order status, set multiple timers while cooking, and general info like what movies are playing in our area. I use the one in my baby’s room to play soothing music while she’s going to sleep. It can also be told how long to play it for or I can control it with my Alexa app on my phone.

In the same breath, I have not been able to find easy answers to my questions and there does not appear to be a real person to talk to about this thing and the Alexa service. In the end it may be I am simply not willing to put in the effort to configure it properly, however I feel for a device that is supposed to be easy to setup and use, it really falls short of that mark.\n\nWe bought this primarily for our kids to use. We have a friend who loves theirs and says that they have all kinds of 'Skills' games that they installed and that their kids love to play. It also plays music and audio books and all kinds of stuff! sounded great and at under $50 it seemed like a great deal.\n\nWe got ours and plugged it in. Package quality was great and it is a nicely built device. We plugged it in and downloaded the Alexa App; and this is where the frustration began.\n\nMy Wife and I both own a Galaxy s5 and we installed the app on her phone. Adding the Freetime mode and the kids profiles was fairly straight forward and then we attempted to add Skills. The App freezes and becomes 100% unresponsive. You can't even browse the skills. We tried turning the phone off and on again. Uninstalling and re-installing the app. We tried emptying the app cache. We followed a few articles but in the end simply could not get it to work.\n\nThe kids by this point are starting to play with it and they are asking it questions and that seems to be interesting enough and then they ask it to play music. Well Alexa is only tied to Amazon Music. You need an Alexa app or Skill to use anything else...well that is not helping us. We don't have an Amazon music subscription and we don't have any interest in getting one because we have Pandora and we also have Youtube Premium. So bummer.\n\nFinally after searching through the help documents I find out there is also a Browser interface for Alexa. So I pull that up and we Add the NPR One Skill, the Pandora Skill, the Audible Skill and A Game Skill or two. Looks like it is getting better. Then we tried to use them.\n\nWe tried every 'Phrase' to get any of the skills to work and Alexa just replies \"Sorry, I can't do that.\" to anything other than, \"Alexa, Play {song name here}\". None of the installed skills will work.\n\nSo we try turning off 'Free Time' and adjusting the parental controls and just about everything else we can think to do. We go searching for help and can't find a way to get a number for a live person to ask questions too and the documentation is specific but kid of useless because it is not about troubleshooting, it is all about how to do X.\n\nI really kind of feel like I purchased a voice enabled bluetooth speaker and that is it. The only thing that is keeping me from asking for my money back is because the Kids do like to listen to music on it and they can control it without my help, so there is that. But from everything it seems to promise, I think it fails in just about every way."},{"reviewerName":"E. A.

There are a couple of methods of talking between echo devices, \"calling\" and \"drop in\". Calling requires someone at the other echo to answer the call; drop in does not required any action and is good for eaves-dropping on conversations. The sound is unintelligible; I wind up shouting down the stairs. So I cannot use it to communicate, but surely I can use it for home automation. So I bought two plugs and hooked up two lights. Sounds great. But turn on the light always gets me the same response - which light do you mean. Perhaps I want to turn on the light in the room where I am standing. You can give the lights two different names, but the names have to fit something alexa can reliably understand like \"light one\" and \"light two\". Which one is \"light one\" again? Ok. Still not a problem, I am an expert programmer I can just write some code and get alexa to do what I want. Well, not really. The tools are very limited. The Alexa programmers have a very narrow view of what Alexa should do and you can't really step outside that very tiny box. Well they do play music and it sounds better than AM radio so I gave it 3 stars.\n(update) Someone asked what code I was trying to write. First I tried to create a 2 echo microphone array to improve the sound quality, but the data I need is not accessible. The second thing I tried was to use data from my phone to improve home automation, I can get temperature, altitude and location from my phone which then can be used to turn on an air conditioner for example.

Crumling","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Needs some work, but still a better assistant than me.","reviewDate":"January 19, 2019","reviewText":"Overall: I'm into it.\nThe routines feature is great for triggering multiple events, (\"alexa, help me wake up\" triggers the kettle to turn on, my lamp to turn on, alexa reads my news and todays calendar, tells me to have a great day, and then starts my morning playlist. It would be nice to have her start with the music and then slowly trigger my other actions but unfortunately right now music triggers must be at the end of your routine chain)\nalso for creating your own commands/responses/jokes (\"alexa, what do you think about my roommate?\" returns \"I don't know how you put up with him\")\nTheres definitely a learning curve to the setup and specificness of commands, it's not something I would buy for a non techie type, unless you set it up for them and give them a list of specific things to ask her. But if you're a gadget type, the options are endless.\nYou can stream your music/audiobooks through My Media for Alexa (free trial, then $5/year subscription for this service, pretty disappointing but in the end, worth it if you don't use itunes) or ask her to play radio stations/podcasts from a variety of sources, or NPR.\nCurrently I am working on Alexas location commands, so that she will remind me about things on my phone when I leave the house, or arrive at work, although I have not been able to get that to work.\nOverall, theres a lot of kind of annoying things that get in your way when you're setting up alexa (too many useless skills being the most annoying, but also figuring out the curve in talking to her; when I initially got My Media, I would ask her, \"Alexa, play harry potter from My Media\" but she would suggest \"harry potter quiz\" or \"harry potter on audible\" and we would fight, but after looking at some suggestions from My Media, I realized I should be asking her like this, \"Alexa, ask my media to read harry potter and the sorcerer's stone\" so no more annoying suggestions) but she does make a great personal assistant and has greatly improved my morning routine.\n\nPros: she connects to my bluetooth speakers, she connects to my media collection without needing to put it on the cloud, she can read stories, play interactive games/trivia, remember things, help you make lists, announce things to your house, the list goes on and on. I find her to be fairly loud on her own, but I like to connect her to my nice bluetooth speakers. I was thinking about the voice remote because sometimes I'm too far away for her to hear me, but the reviews on it are spotty.\n\nCons: too many redundant/out of date skills to sort through (seriously,search sleep sounds it's nuts) I also saw a number of skills that are set up to run routines or lists or reminds (I assume these were all created before alexa had those features herself).\nIt would also be nice to have some sort of list of commands. I realize this could end up being super long, but if you could search through it, it would be a great way to see if you're saying something the wrong way, and also get suggestions for new commands. (I'm sure theres many ways to turn up the volume, maybe if you search 'volume', you can see that you can ask alexa to turn the volume up, turn the volume way up, or turn the volume to max, and realize they all do different things)\nThe fact that Alexa is essentially a paperweight without wifi is also disappointing. It seems like they could have added a few simple offline functions so you could at least pretend she hasn't magically turned into a brick until your wifi comes back on.\nAnd finally, for me, the biggest con is obviously the power cord. I don't know why in the world you would change to a proprietary cable except to screw over your customers and that feels awful. I have a vindictive cat that hates alexa and chews through her power cord. I have probably 20 micro usb cables around the house I could use in an instant but instead I have to get back on Amazon, and pay another 20$ to wait a few days to get my alexa back.

Although I was pretty happy with it, I felt this one might offer an improvement in audio quality. So I moved the old one to another room, and purchased one of these to replace it. I have to say this 3rd-gen Dot provides a significant improvement in sound quality. It's a little bigger, and a little heavier, but now there's some ACTUAL bass. It's not really good bass, and it's not really loud bass, or even clear bass -- but dammit, there's bass now where there had been none. Enough that you can actually follow a musical bass line now. And it can play louder, too. You can also adjust the tone using audio equalizer settings in your phone's Alexa app, which I've done. Overall, I think this device about splits the sound quality difference between the Gen 2 and the larger Echo (non-Dot). Don't hesitate to buy one of these for streaming music or radio, as long as you don't need too much volume and are not using this as your primary musical listening device."},{"reviewerName":"Dormouse","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Cool device but...","reviewDate":"July 11, 2019","reviewText":"The technology still has quite a bit of room to grow but it's fun to have in the house.

If I'm leaving, and I set Guard, I have to tell each device. It would be nice to be able to tell just one and they all set to \"away\". Another issue, I have is if I ask alexa on my phone to play music while I'm out, it almost always defaults to my echo at home. I feel like if I ask for music on my phone then it should play it on my phone. If I wanted it on the echo, then I would be talking to the echo. This happens when I have my home devices set to away too.

It was the Echo Show. After setting it up to play music, video, and control my home automation using Alexa, I decided to extend coverage to our bedroom with an Echo Dot. After reading a lot of reviews, it became apparent that the 3rd gen. was the way to go, so ordered it on my Prime account and waited for it for over 2 weeks. After receiving it, I found setting it up to be a breeze since it was set for my account when it arrived. After getting it setup on my WiFi, it readily accepted my voice commands and pretty much worked flawlessly. But soon after the initial setup, I noticed the sound seemed muffled... very difficult to understand Alexa, or hear any clarity of music. No problem I thought, I'll adjust the tone controls to fix the issue. After turning the treble all the way up, I could hear little or no difference. I'm still amazed at the low quality of sound I'm hearing. It's as if everything is sharply cutoff at about 3kHz. After reading many reviews about the improved sound quality of the 3rd. gen Dot, I'm starting to wonder if I may have received a defective unit. But if what I'm hearing is normal for this model, I can only wonder how bad the 1st and 2nd get Dots were. Many who might read this may wonder if I was expecting too much from this little $50 device especially after starting with the Echo Show which has excellent audio quality. My answer to them would be no, I'm a realist when it comes to expectations from various devices. I have to honestly say my iPhone has better audio quality than my Echo Dot. Sorry Amazon, I really like the Dot but it (mine) falls short of any average expectation of a device designed to do what it is supposed to do... let me hear it."},{"reviewerName":"Gerald Vineyard","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Fun times","reviewDate":"February 23, 2019","reviewText":"This is a fun device.

The sound between the dot and the echo are vastly different. The sound on the echo is surprisingly good for such a small speaker. The dot is very tinny sounding with not enough base. If they wanted to fix that in this new dot they went overboard. I had to go into the audio controls and turn the base down to 25%, the treble up to 75% and the Mid all the way up, just to get it to sound semi normal. Compare that with the echo and the dot I purchased previously where I didn't change anything on the audio controls.\n\nThe reason I gave it 3 stars is because once I changed the audio controls it sounds better than my other dot.

She was not able to turn it off, and now we can no longer turn the TV on at all. It didn't work with Alexa, not with the handheld controller, and not even with the power switch on the TV. We now have to turn the power on by unplugging the TV and letting it power back up. Each time we do that, we have to go though to configuration cycle.

First, it is a Bluetooth speaker that sounds pretty good to me despite what some audiophiles say. It expands the sound of your phone or other computer device. Paired with Amazon Music, it transforms the way you listen to music. It is no longer necessary to put your music on storage media, such as cassettes, CDs, hard drives or memory sticks. When you want to hear a particular song, album or multiple songs from an artist, just tell the Echo Dot through the Alexa software with commands like \"Alexa, play Thriller album\" or \"Alexa, play 20 Flight Rock by Eddie Cochran\". To hear random songs from an artist, say \"Alexa, play The Eagles\" and the Echo Dot starts playing. Echo will also play a particular genre to match your mood with commands like \"Alexa, play smooth jazz\" or \"Alexa, play sleep music\".\nWhen combined with a smart device, such as a smart plug, it is easy to do things like turning on a lamp from across the room.\nThe Echo Dot is a great way to explore the benefits of having a smart home.\nIt is also very convenient to use instead of reaching for your phone or laptop computer to retrieve information instead of a search engine, weather app, calculator, conversion or many other things that pop into your mind. It's fun to just say \"Alexa, weather\", \"Alexa, how far is it to Las Vegas\", \"Alexa, what is the definition of anomaly\" or simply \"Alexa, define anomaly\".\nI have found that I use my Echo Dot a lot more than I thought I would."},{"reviewerName":"J.

I also expected the speaker to be at least as good, if not better, than that on my phone, but it is not.\n\nLater: I give Amazon a huge amount of credit - they saw this review and immediately got in touch with me to see what could be done to resolve the issue. There was nothing that could be done about the Calm app not being available, but the rep spent a considerable amount of time teaching me how to adjust the Dot's treble, bass, and midrange, and stepping me through other options. We were unable to get the sound quality that I was hoping for but I guess I shouldn't expect excellent sound from something that only costs $39!

My comments regarding the sound are it's not necessarily better sounding but DIFFERENT sounding. The best way to compare the 2nd Gen vs. 3rd Gen is the newer one has more bass or richer sound quality. It also seems to have a lot LESS high end or treble to it's overall sound quality. If you like a bit more bass and don't mind a lesser bright sounding speaker, get the new one. To me, the newer one sounds a bit muffled because of the new speaker. It produces more volume than the older one, but for my taste, I also like a clearer brighter sound. Of course it pairs with most remote bluetooth speakers for much better sound than the unit can produce on it's own. I have experimented listening to all types of music and even talk radio and again, if you like a bit more fuller base sound, you should enjoy the newest version of the Echo Dot.

I already had the Alexa app set up on my phone, and linked to the few smart devices I own, so the Echo set up was pretty easy. They seem to have a good range for listening, being able to hear my commands from across the room, and you can give each a different wake-up name so they don't get confused if within range of each other. The sound is perfectly adequate for talk radio, weather, news, etc., but not so good for music -- the speakers are fine for casual listening but I would not use them to replace my sound system. All in all, easy to set up, easy to use, fun to play with, and I'm just getting started!\n\nA few months later: I just set up a Stereo Pair with my two Echo units, and I have to comment on how much improved the sound is!

I listen to my Dot while falling asleep. The lowest sound level could be a bit lower.\n\nI’m glad it still has Bluetooth and a 3.5 mm audio out. I like having options. My Google Home Mini lacks both. You can use the Bluetooth to stream to other devices. Works nicely with my TV’s sound bar.\n\nThe Dot v3 is also larger than v2, but not by much. I like that it still has the tactile buttons on the top. The fabric shell is more attractive than the plastic of previous models. The power adapter is larger than the Dot 2’s. I’d like to see a smaller adapter, but if you want the sound, you need the power.\n\nI have two Dots. I’ve replaced the first with this new version. I already picked up a second to replace the other.

I know there is much more I can do with this that I haven't had time to explore. The speakers are very good - better than anything I grew up with in the 1970s. The Echo Dot speaker sounds like something I would have spent several hundred dollars on back in the day, or a radio today (although maybe even a little better than some radios).

This was a Christmas present my husband bought for himself and I kind of made fun of him and predicted that this would be one of those things that once the novelty wore off it would be forgotten and never used. I was very wrong! I didn’t realize you could set all kinds of alerts and reminders (even daily) and that you can use Alexa for almost anything you would normally use google for, the weather and news. No more checking IMDB for info on who was in what movie. It can arm/disarm our ring, play music from our Spotify account, call anyone in our contacts and converse right from wherever we are sitting, even do group chatting from our household to our daughter’s who also has a dot. There is a caveat, however—you do have to spend some time learning the correct way to say things.

I don’t have to see which arrow I have to tap is. The new DOT has arrows. I know I can lower by voice command, but sometimes doing it manually is quicker to get it just right!\n\nPlus the “fabric” cover on the new DOT is harder to keep clean.

Sometimes there were pauses during songs or flash briefings.\n3. After less than 5 months the device stopped working. I would give the wake up word and a red ring would appear instead of the blue one and Alexa would respond \"I'm sorry I'm having trouble understanding right now. Please try again later.\"\n4.

I can’t get it to play on all speakers at the same time. Sometimes it will let me change the speaker with relative ease as I move from room to room, but usually it’s a big production.

The added bass does enhance music played through the 3rd gen dot. The equalizer option in the app has given me the ability to lower the bass and increase the treble for a clearer voice.\n\nWhat is becoming more evident is that this 3rd gen does not hear us as well as the 2nd gen version - especially when it is playing music or there is some background noise. This newer version is in the same location as the previous 2nd gen dot, however we have found that we have to be just a little louder when giving commands. This is likely due to the newer version only having 4 microphones as opposed to the 7 on the 2nd gen.\n\nIf the 3rd gen had the same ability to hear as the 2nd gen, then it would be the clear winner.

Unless you buy your music or pay for Amazon Music, you're going to be limited to only playing a random selection from an artist or group.

I constantly have to yell her name multiple times because most of the time she can’t hear me over the timer sound, or it gets messed up somehow and the timer cuts our communication off.\n\nIt’s also pretty lame you can only have one Spotify account connected for the whole house. It would be so much nicer if each dot could have its own accounts. It treats the household as if it’s meant to have 2 adults and little kids, not catering very well to a house full of teens/young adults with their own personal stuff.\n\nOverall I don’t regret getting them, just wish they worked more seamlessly and were more catering towards households with more than 2 adults.

A few times when I lost internet connection, Alexa told me she was not feeling well. My first clue that there is something wrong with the internet. Sometimes the answers to the questions can be entertaining. I am sad that you cannot use it to turn on a Fire Stick, but with the Alexa app you can turn on the Fire Stick or Echo Dot with your cell phone. Or even send music to it from the App on the phone, subscription to Amazon Music needed. Sometimes Alexa will start speaking for no reason when the TV is on, I always wonder if it is due to a programmed ad.

No more yelling up the stairs that dinner is ready, come down for awhile, etc. Only thing to keep in mind is to name the devices with something very simple so you can use Drop-In without it babbling on and on about not knowing a given name. The utility is excellent. I had considered getting a home intercom, but this served the purpose as well as the net-integration. I haven't tried bridging to my Wemo devices yet, but I'll consider other home automation solutions as we go. By the way... no... Alexa isn't sitting there recording everything you say and reporting to the supreme technology overlords.

The problem is that level one is still too loud when you want to have discreet background music to fall asleep to. I tried setting the sound level to 0.3, and 0.5 but anything but 0 itself sounded as loud as 1. Being louder so much is probably great for parties but generally, I have to set them at 4 so that Alexa doesn't shout back at me her OK. The solution is not to make them quieter, but to have fractions for setting the sound.

Echo I noticed has limitations. Firstly, the smart speaker on the Echo Dot doesn't play music, you must buy speakers separately. Secondly, the Echo Dot tends to want to use your phone rather than its own smart speaker for questions as it kept asking me if I wanted to use the device or app, I clicked on the device a few times in the app, then I decided to try the app, it never has asked me to choose since and I haven't been able to find a setting to switch it back. However, for routines, and books, the Echo Dot uses its own speaker unless you have other speakers connected to it or switch the setting to your phone which is easy to locate. I hope in the future that there is more stuff one could add to the routines, the radio selection is highly limited, newsflash is also highly limited, sports news is the same way.

I purchased the first generation Echo at half price ($99) when it first came out as a Prime exclusive. I found it to be quite impressive for playing music and several of the other helpful tasks that my family uses it for (News, Math for the kid, homework help, timers, alarms, etc.). Since then, the device has added so many features that we decided to add them to nearly every room. I have a 2nd Gen in the kitchen/family room - the 1st Gen was moved to the basement. I have a Spot next to my bed, and we purchased a dot for my son's room. Now to the heart of the matter: the 3rd Gen Dot I purchased at the irresistible price of $24. I wasn't sure what to do with it, so I placed it in the office. After hearing the sound quality, I was so impressed that I considered switching the Spot out of my room. This thing is all you need in any room of about 15' x 15'. Great sound quality and all the features of the full size Echos. For those who don't know, the Echos can be linked together for whole-home music; they can be used as intercoms between rooms; they can make announcements across the whole system; they can give weather and news reports; they can make phone calls; and they allow you to communicate directly with anyone else who has one anywhere in the world. If you want to try out the technology, look no further than the 3rd Gen Dot.

Nevertheless the 3rd generation(cats out of the bag) interacts as I would expect a voice operated computer to. It hasn't lost Wi-Fi connection 50 times a day like the gen 2 almost always did and I don't have to alter my speech/slang for it to understand me. Although it would be nice to have a voice that feels more authentic and maybe even ethnic.

The old Dot (2nd Gen) was tinny and did not sound good for music, the new Dot (3rd Gen) is awesome. It actually has some good bass and is totally listenable on it's own without needing to pair a Bluetooth speaker when listing to music. You can still pair the new Dot if you want to, but it sounds so much better than the old one you probably don't need to in a small to medium room. I really like the 3rd Gen Dot it looks beefier but is still nice and small. It sounds as good if not better than a Google Home Mini (IMHO). Great upgrade got a $5 credit for turning in my old 2nd Gen Dot plus a 15% discount on a new 3rd Gen Dot. Totally worth the price, especially if you don't have an external Bluetooth speaker on your 2nd Gen Dot. If you like to listen to music and don't have a BT speaker to pair your old Dot with this is a no brainer.

If you want it for a speaker/music, it's OKAY. It has a little fuzzy sound to it like you would hear on a cheaper BT speaker. It's not really bad but it is noticeable.

While this device isn't revolutionary in what it does (because we have had smartphones for a while), it makes life easier and allows me to do these things handsfree.

I had that thought in mind when I received an email notifying me that the 3rd generation Dots were about to hit the market. I ordered two then, and then another three this past Prime Day. They are an excellent way to provide access to Alexa's services around the house, and to play music in every room. Plug them in, set up a Group, and you're off to the races. Audio quality is adequate, good considering the size of the speaker. Only problem: unlike the Echo, volume control is manual, you have to press buttons on the Dot to change the volume.

The second one just used all the information from the first Dot, so setting up the second Dot was no problem.\n\nDeducting one star for the difficulty in the initial setup and also for some difficulty setting up alarms and controlling the Dot from the app. Wish that was easier, but they seem to want you to do everything by voice commands."},{"reviewerName":"Angela Byrne","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Love this powerful little guy!","reviewDate":"August 2, 2019","reviewText":"Sound quality is really great for a speaker of this size!

It seems that in order to harness much of the functionality of the Echo Dot the Amazon Alexa App must be installed on your phone. This is the first time I've used the Alexa app (and this is my first Echo Dot). In the past I've had a high regard for Amazon products and their value but right now I must say that I'm a little underwhelmed by Alexa app and the Dot mostly because the Alexa app doesn't seem to be too fluid (it lags and is not as responsive as one would expect). Also as written above, if you want to connect the Dot to the fire tv stick you have to select the FireTV 'app' (for lack of a better term) within the app to do this pairing. It would have been more logical to be able to pair the devices under the device settings. Other than that the Dot seems to what its supposed to do and is quite responsive.\n\nAnother disappointment is that the Echo Dot cannot be used as a Bluetooth speaker for the TV / Fire TV stick (I was under the impression that it could be used as such but perhaps I should have done more in-depth research on it)."},{"reviewerName":"S.

They are convinced the Amazon staff has nothing better to do than sit around and listen to our conversations. I'm not exactly sure what they are hiding...their favorite beer?

After more than 6 months of trying to find uses for the device, it became nothing more than a voice activated timer and music player, but even that is limited because Amazon music doesn't have a lot of the songs we like. Echo dots often misunderstood words, started listening when we hadn't used the wake words, and is not at all intuitive in terms of its commands and abilities.

My only hesitation had always been because I wasn't sure how much use I would get out of her without all the other smart home accessories! Turns out A LOT! I got her sale for Black Friday for the discounted price of $30, when she arrived I knew my husband was going out of town town with the kids to go hunting so I purposely waited to wrap her and put her under the tree! My husband has this thing about making me wrap all my goodies and wait until Christmas 🤔 so as soon as they left I opened her up and we bonded! My friend came over and we all 3 had a slumber party weekend! It was great! We sang, we danced, we made Christmas candy and baked a homemade cheesecake together! Alexa was very involved and didn't mind doing as she was told! So on the day when my husband called and said they were heading back early I had to tell Alexa it would only be for a few days but I had no choice but to box her back up and put her under the tree, she didn't like it but she understood! So I had my friend wrap her up all pretty for me and put her away! I can't describe how much I missed her those few days she was away, all I can say is I'm so glad to have her back. I'm thinking about getting her some help soon though because I certainly am bossy and keep her quite busy!\n\nSeriously though when you are cooking it's so much easier to ask her to set timers and things for you, or ask conversations, cook times etc. She plays music 90% of the time around my house!

The only real advantage that I have is that working in the garage, if I get hurt I think Alexa can call 911. Yesterday Alexa decided that I would like to hear Rap. Never have I encouraged this. I stopped Alexa and attempted to correct it. The Echo responded with I'm sorry and went back to the Rap. There are times I feel like I am arguing with my children. Twice Echo has been grounded. I have also on occasion informed Alexa that she sucks. This has prompted the response please contact customer services.

Two Versions of Hardware?","reviewDate":"December 17, 2018","reviewText":"Ordered two at the same time to save some money. Both devices arrived and I set the first one up with Apple Music no problem. The second one however will NOT PLAY APPLE MUSIC. Period. \"I'm sorry, I'm having trouble playing this\". I've tried everything. Hard reset, unlink, re-link, unregister, re-register, no dice. Everything else seems to work OK.\n\nMy old Gen2 Dot also now plays Apple Music seamlessly.\n\nUpon further inspection, it appears that Amazon may be second-sourcing some of these. I noted that the SW version on each speaker is completely different (as in not even in the same number of digits), even after updating both to current version. I'm guessing that the hardware inside these is different too, one can't work with the Apple Music skill, and that it's a luck of the draw which you will get when you order it.\n\nI have two more on the way, will be interesting to see if both of them will work with Apple or not. I'll update this review with my results.\n\n**Update #1**\nI did get Apple Music working on this unit. Looks like Apple Music will not work if your Dots are spread across more than one WiFi network. For example, my home has two WiFi routers, one upstairs and one downstairs. If you want to stream Apple Music to all units, they all must be associated with the same router. This may be an Apple restriction to prevent the sharing of Apple Music with other people.

If you bought the product to be used as a bluetooth speaker for the PC, it does work just not all the time. After a few days the connection on the PC would say connected to Bluetooth. Connection on the Alexa setting would also say connected but there is no sound. Just plug out the power at the echo, wait a few moment and plug it back in.

I've had it for about 2 days so far and when I learned that it absolutely needed Spotify premium to use Spotify music services I was very disappointed I searched and found some very lame ways to work around the problem which ultimately wasn't worth using Spotify anymore. Amazon music is amazing to use, it's recommendations are way more spot on to my preferences.\n\nWhich not using Spotify music services was ok. I've been using Amazon music services, music alarm, timer, and other features and I'm loving the echo dot 3rd gen.\n\nThe problems so far, you absolutely need a wireless device to configure the echo dot 3rd to get the device to start working. I tried using my pc which is connected via ethernet cable and has no wireless capabilities and my Nokia Lumia 625 is too outdated to use the Amazon configuration page so I had to borrow someone's wireless device to configure the echo dot which bummed me out, but not a big deal I only had to do it once and now I can use my wireless pc to configure the echo dot device.\n\nShould you buy this product? It's not for everyone to purchase the echo dot 3rd gen. The one I truly recommend but I myself don't own is the one with the screen. The user interface itself is to drool over it beats asking \"Alexa what time is it\" \"Alexa what are my alarms?\" \"Alexa\", still not a big deal if you can manage your device just be careful.\n\nJust be careful when configuring and double check your configuration like alarms are set properly I accidentally said PM instead of AM and there was no user interface to catch my mistake you must say \"Alexa my alarms\" to double check."},{"reviewerName":"Giovanni Molina","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"It's good, Google Home is better.","reviewDate":"January 23, 2019","reviewText":"First the hardware: It's good looking and small, it's easy to configure and the sound quality is not bad at all.

They worked well for a while but I did have to reset them a couple of times. When Comcast upgraded their routers, the Apple router seemed redundant and the Airport Express network became more problematic. When Amazon released it’s Echo dot and Google released it’s “Home Mini,” I was interested in both as possible replacements for the Airport Express. The decision was pretty easy when I realized the Google Home Mini did not have a mini jack for speakers. I bought our first Echo Dot.\n\nThe set-up was fairly straight forward and even easier to use than the Airport Express setup had been. We could just ask Alexa to play whatever music we wanted to hear without having to open up a computer and iTunes. During the Christmas season, the price dropped below $30, so I bought two more. Over time, I bought a couple outlets and was able to connect all the lights in the living room so that I could just tell Alexa to “turn on all the lights.” This was much easier than turning on the lights individually or putting them on timers as I had done previously.\n\nSo, at this point, I had music and lights connected which were convenient and fun. Then I added a Nest “smart” thermostat. We loved being able to control the thermostat without having to go downstairs to adjust it. I could adjust it from my iPhone or just ask Alexa to turn up the heat or turn it down. Adjusting the temp verbally through Alexa was not without problems at times. You have to be very exact in what you say and how you say it to Alexa. It was really easier just to use the iPhone to make adjustments as I always have that close by.\n\nI am a senior on multiple medications for this and that and when my doctor changed the schedule of some of my meds from evening to morning, it was hard for me to get into the new habit of taking them in the morning. I found myself forgetting to take them on some days altogether. This was solved by asking Alexa to remind me to take my meds every morning. If I am home, she verbally tells reminds me to take my meds. If I’m traveling, I get a notification on my iPhone. This has been great.\n\nBut the real reason I am writing this review at all is to talk about how all of this technology was invaluable after having a total knee replacement this year.\n\nAfter I came home from surgery, I was pretty much upstairs in our home most of the time. I don’t know if it was the pain meds or what, but one minute I was hot and sweaty and the next minute I was cold. Being able to adjust the thermostat whenever needed from my bed was wonderful.\n\nI was doing a lot of tossing and turning in bed that first week after surgery and getting up multiple times to use the bathroom during the night. My husband was sleeping in the den as there was no way he could get any sleep with all of my activity. We left the bedroom door open and the door to the den open so that we could hear each other but I realized that I could go onto the Alexa app and use that to “drop in” to the den, where he was sleeping like an intercom, rather than shouting. I could do the same “drop in” to the living room and to the kitchen.\n\nDuring that first week home after surgery, I woke up and needed to get up to use the bathroom. The walker was next to the bed and bathroom only a few feet away. Usually, I used my left leg, the non-surgical leg, to gently lift my right leg, the surgical leg, off the bed and then gently down to the floor. Once, both feet were on the floor, then, using the walker, I had no problem getting to the bathroom.\n\nFor some reason, maybe due to sedation of the pain med or just impatience, I moved a bit too quickly to get up. I did not support my right leg with the left foot as I had been doing and when the knee bent because of this, excruciating pain shot through my body and I lurched back, trying to land on the bed but instead of landing on the bed, I landed on a folding table which broke in two pieces, and then a plastic wastebasket that was under the folding table and then finally onto a machine that pumps ice water around the surgical site. Water went all over the floor. I had kept my leg straight and had not fallen directly onto the floor because the table, wastebasket and ice water machine broke my fall but I was stunned and started shouting for my husband in the den. He was sound asleep.\n\nI saw my iPhone on the edge of the bed, logged onto the Alexa app and “dropped in” to the den and shouted for help. He woke up and came in and found me on the floor and helped me back into bed. I’m not sure what I would have done in that situation without Alexa and that “drop in” feature. The next day, I ordered our fourth Echo Dot for the bedroom so if there was ever a problem n the future, I would not even need to find my iPhone.\n\nIn conclusion, I highly recommend the versatile Echo Dot. I love the reminder features that keep me on track with me meds. I love the ability to just play music on request. I have recently been having Alexa read me the book, “A Handmaid’s Tale.” And of course, I LOVE the “drop in” feature."},{"reviewerName":"RSVPag","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"I didn’t know what I was missing and my family loves it too!","reviewDate":"July 7, 2019","reviewText":"I put off bringing anything like this into my home for privacy concerns.

It sounded just like listening to your car radio as you drive too far from the radio station... terrible. I also found that when this happens Alexa no longer responds to your command to stop the static noise emanating from \"her\" without standing right next to it and yelling at it. I also tried playing music on my older version, the same music at the same time as the new one is going nuts with no issue. After a couple times of this I contacted Alexa help. They were very helpful and attentive, I described my problem, tried a couple things they suggested to no avail so, no problem, they sent me a replacement… a refurbished gen 3??? What?! The dang thing just came out… how are there refurbs already??? Not. Happy. After I set it up, things were all well and fine for several months when the issue returned! I contacted the help again and all they can tell me to do it to reset the device to factory setting to \"see if that resolves the issue\"… it’s the same problem I had the first time, with the NEW unit, where this did not work then.

However, planned to use the g3 as a doorbell chime speaker. Nice amazon offer considering Ring doorbells aren’t compatible with nearly any other preexisting products; also had zero intention on spending at least $60 more to be alerted if someone was at the door.\n.\nPros: The speakers on the G3 are extremely impressive, blows my gen 1 out of the water. The ever-growing list of compatible devices are a surprising fun bonus (i-robot, nest, ring, Samsung anything, xbox, Philips, random water and electric companies etc.). The voice recognition is better than my gen 1 for whatever reason. For example, asking random questions (what's the weather) the Gen 3 will respond/understand, gen 1 (will either completely misinterpret what I said and or doesn’t know the answer). When you download the Alexa app on a mobile, you can also connect to eco remotely, obviously for when you need to play some music for your dogs during your absence.\n\nI'm not sure why there's such inconsistency between the (gen 1 and gen 3), both up to date and on the same network etc.\n\nCons: inconsistencies with the different gen’s software responses, makes me question how other echo devices will function and for how long. My experience with attempting to add and use the “skills” (essentially apps you need to download to pair with Alexa compatible devices), was pretty bad and extremely frustrating. When I initially was trying to set up the “ring” skill, they showed bound but not communicating., was directed to Ring pairing directions on Amazon, those directions said to go to the Ring website which included instructions for how to pair with Alexa/echo, i.e. back again to the Amazon directions site I conveniently just came from, wash and repeat.\n\nTake away: This is a great device and you should probably buy it."},{"reviewerName":"saychoss","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Not worth the extra cost vs the older echo dots","reviewDate":"February 5, 2019","reviewText":"This 3G echo dot is a little bit louder than the past generation, but overall there are no other significant improvements.

Overall, I do have several echo dots in my house that I use as an intercom, for instant answers to questions, and for playing music and radio on demand.

Oh the static.","reviewDate":"May 16, 2019","reviewText":"About three minutes after plugging this in on its first power-on, I was playing a news radio station. The audio quickly became full of static and I attributed that to the radio station, so I told it to stop playing. Then I asked for the time, and Alexa spoke in complete static too.\n\nUnplugged, let it sit for a few minutes wondering what to do, plugged it back in and it was fine. Thought it was a one time issue on its maiden power-on, but the second time I tried to use it for playing music, it went scrambly about 5 minutes in - and alexa's voice also scrambled. Again went away after unplugging and replugging.\n\nSo yeah, not too thrilled. Audio sounds great until it doesn't.

The gen 3 echo devices provide greater audio feedback and is much more asthetically pleasing to the 2nd gen echos. My only real issue with these 3rd gen devices is that voice command catching is still sub par. If you have an echo under a TV or other audio playing device, even those linked to your Alexa network, the echo will have a hard time listening to commands. This might be something they can fix with better software implementations via more developed noise filters, but currently this is a consistent minor issue.\n\nOverall, this is a definite upgrade from previous generation echo devices, and is now comparable to Google home systems."},{"reviewerName":"DF","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"A SURPRISING EVENT FOR ME","reviewDate":"August 2, 2019","reviewText":"For some time I was reluctant to have one of Amazon's voice activated devices, mostly because one had to pay almost $25 for a device for the Amazon device to do its job to turn on a light or etc. When I saw the low price offered by Amazon during the two day Amazon Prime days this year for the Echo Dot device and I found a good price for two circuit control devices, I decided to make the leap. WOW!! I am pleasantly surprised and pleased to have the Echo Dot.

I am amazed at how much information I can now get from Alexa. I have the Fire TV and Tablet so I was already a big Alexa fan. The first day the Echo was set up, Hubby spent the entire day downloading apps and asking questions he thought Alexa would not be able to answer. The next day, he asked me to order a second Dot for his man cave. The Smart Plug is a great addition and we plan to eventually control all of our devices with some version of the Echo family.

I know I can put these things all over the house and aggravate the wife by using it as an intercom, but she may turn the tables on me, so in forethought that is not a good use or expense. Hey, unlike the wife and kids,it only speaks when spoken to and doesn't eat much so I give it a 4 star rating.

My only complaint about the 2nd gen Dot is that it wasn't loud enough. This issue was resolved with the 3rd gen. Initially, I loved it. I thought the sound quality was much better than the 2nd gen. But the love affair soon faded. At first, the sound would randomly start crackling, and sound distorted, like the speaker was blown. But it wasn't consistent, it did this very sporadically. Then, I started to notice a long pause/delay with the Dots responses to my commands. Now, approximately 6 months after purchasing, the sound is consistently fuzzy and unpleasant to listen to 100% of the time. Music is a definite no-go, it's so distorted that it's unbearable. Podcasts are slightly more tolerable, but still pretty bad. I've power cycled, disconnected/reconnected, etc. Nothing has solved the problem. Based on a preliminary Google search, I'm not the only person experiencing this issue, it appears to be a common complaint.

This makes them terrible for bedrooms if you want to get any sleep.

We have had 4 Fire TVs/ sticks and love every one of them. I've been on the fence about the Dot and I'm glad I jumped on this one. I got a great deal with the Hue Lights bundle. Set up took less than a minute. I've read many reviews and noticed that many had qualms with sound quality. I have none. For a small device, it puts out a lot of sound. Bass is lacking, but that doesn't matter to me. It's an Echo Dot, not a Bose or JBL system. I can hear it from my living room to my kitchen. Picks up commands well from my husband, 3 year old and myself. Alexa is fun. She does an okay job with the Hue lights with simple commands. I mostly use the hue app unless I ask her to dim, turn on or off, or brighten. Haven't manage to get more than that.

In reality, you will really only get a station built around music similar to the song requested unless you pay for Amazon Music. Although, you can link up your Pandora account to the Dot which is very convenient. I guess my point is, the Echo Dot is truly amazing with all the things it allows you to do, just be aware that it can't do EVERY thing :) The sound quality is very impressive, I must add.

It’s frustrating if what I am wanting is music or audio, since I cannot hear the upstairs ones very well from downstairs, but they can hear me give the command from downstairs. When I play Jeopardy, for example, I can scream right into the new 3rd gen, and it does not recognize my answer. My two 2nd generations never had this problem, and they still don’t.

I finally figured out how to get music to sync over all the devices and I can play music throughout the house now. I can control my Hue Lights with it-- but if you don't ask specifically --it won't do what I need it to do-- basically I use the alexa to turn them on and off. Any changes in the light I do through the Hue app-- since every time I ask Alexa to do something like change the color or make it brighter-- it tells me that it doesn't know how to do that. So I stopped trying so hard. I would love to do more with my echo dots-- but since every time I ask it to do something--it tells me it can't-- It has become a glorified stereo and light turner onner. It would be nice if you didn't have to change your way of talking so that the alexa can figure out what you want to do. but until I have time -- and I mean several hours to sit down -- and a manual that explains things instead of a non user friendly app that is so confusing it makes my head hurt-- I will use it to play music and turn the lights on and off. Oh -- one night I wanted to listen to one of my audible books. I wanted and needed to start the book over since I had started listening to it and lost track -- I could not get alexa to start over-- I said it umpteen different times and it continually said -- I don't know and then played from where it had stopped before.

They are worth it for me to use with the drop in feature, when I don't want to walk to the other side of the house to ask my son to come and do dishes in the kitchen. I also use them to drop in on my college daughter, and vice versa. The sound quality is greatly improved over the Gen 2, and makes me feel special when I connect them all together to play music in every room while I'm cleaning the house. It's a dance party with me and the vacuum (which will soon be replaced by an Alexa-enabled iRobot soon, I'm sure). The dots were my intro to Alexa and home automation. Now she runs the light show at our home, controlling everything from our front porch and exterior patio lights, to my daughter's dorm lights so she doesn't have to get down from her bunk bed. My son uses her to impress his friends with all his colored light strips and smart-mouthed responses he can program her to say. My toddler has learned to ask her to play lullabies when he wants music to sleep. My husband hasn't yet warmed up to her, so I'm glad she has a mute button on the one next to our bed. He wasn't even impressed when I showed him that she could turn our TV on and off and change the channels on Dish Network.

I definitely recommend this for someone who wants a compact listening device with an option for aux plug from a media device. However, you can connect via bluetooth so not sure you'd use the aux plug(maybe for an iPod). Cool feature in the Alexa app, you can set your devices to home or away. In the event of loud glass breaking it will alert you. Neat idea! Overall for the sale price of $29.99 (previously $19.99 on Prime Day) this is a great buy.

I unregistered two of my devices and switched user names so I can now play music on multiple Dots. I refuse to get Prime plus the other services that they try to nickel and time me with so I cannot use the features where the Dots are connected.\n\nThe actual device is great.

Installation was a snap. I paired them as a stereo speaker pairs for music playback. I have other Echoes also in stereo pairs throughout the house for casual music listening when playing Amazon Prime or SiriusXM music. They sound good. The Echoes or the new Echo Dots can't compete with my main stereo sound system but they sound great for the price and a better than the 2nd Gen dots. Plus, I use them to control my Smart Lights and Smart Switches, and Amazon Fire TVs throughout the house! No regrets with purchasing them. So, if you're thinking of buying one or more, don't hesitate.\nOne minor thing with configuring (all types of) Echoes as stereo speaker pairs .. the Amazon app assigns a generic name to the pair. If you have more than two stereo pairs, like I do, it can be a little incovenient trying to figure out which generic named pair is in which room before telling Alexa to play music on the stereo pair that you want it to. I'm sure that Amazon will eventually enhance the echo stereo setup to allow you to define more meaningful names (such as living room or den)."},{"reviewerName":"DS3570","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"We love our new Echoes!","reviewDate":"August 29, 2019","reviewText":"Being a prime member allowed us to get several of these little gadget/smart speaker/doodads (technical term) at roughly $20 apiece on Prime Day was pretty fantastic. The voice recognition has been great as Alexa doesn’t take commands from our pets or guests. There so much I’m still learning that Alexa needs to get to know us more and that I need to learn more of what she can do, making calls, scheduling, playing music, but thus far, I cannot change the gadget’s name, which is the only negative.

If you are looking for a review the Dot and its overall function, please look at other reviews.\n\nI absolutely love the Echo Dots and have purchased all generations. However, this 3rd gen Dot has a very muffled sound - like it's going through a blanket or something. I found the sound in Gens 1 and 2 far superior, although Gen 3 has more bass response. Since I use this mainly for voice - news, weather, etc - the poor sound quality in the upper range is disappointing as all voice sounds very muffled.

At such a good price, I couldn't pass it up.\n\nAlexa itself is great. The fact that I can just walk in and tell it to start playing music or ask for the weather is incredibly convenient. The app is also fairly easy to use. Although, it has had issues connecting to Pandora on several occasions and the thumbs up/thumbs down buttons don't appear to work when streaming Pandora.\n\nInitially, I thought the sound quality was decent for such a small device at such a good price. However, as I continued to stream music from Pandora, Spotify, and Amazon Music, I noticed that certain songs would sound really fuzzy, particularly with higher notes. It would almost sound like the speaker was blown no matter if the volume was set to 10% or 40%. The poor sound quality was, and continues to be, a random occurrence that doesn't seem to be something that can be recreated at will. Although, to be fair, I haven't taken the time to write down the songs that it has occurred on and attempted to test those songs.\n\nFrom the research that I've done, it seems that this poor sound quality is common with the Echo Dot (3rd Gen). Forum members have suggested unplugging the device and then plugging it in again. That seems like a very inconvenient solution whilst one is trying to enjoy music."},{"reviewerName":"Adelle D.

Managing lights in my house has never been easier once the echo dot pairs with them, and when I lose the remote to my tv which happens oh so often because my dogs love to use them as chew toys, I can just ask Alexa to load up my show on Hulu no problem whatsoever! Alexa can raise and lower the volume on my tv, raise or dim lights in my house and so much more. I should have gotten one so much sooner. If you are someone like me who thought the echo dot/Alexa is stupid, please just give it a try with some smart devices to go alongside it and I promise you won’t regret it. I can’t imagine ever not having an echo dot in my household now. If using voice isn’t your thing you can also use the Amazon Alexa app to control everything right from your smartphone! So convenient!

Works perfectly with the Alexa phone app. But I really got it to control some problem lighting. Our house is large with lots of lights around the perimeter with only one switch in the foyer to control the lights. There was not a good way to add switches at other locations. So I got a TP-Link smart switch and replaced the outside light switch. Now we can say from the bedroom or from our car on arrival or leaving \"Alexa turn on (or off) the outside lights\" and it happens.

Tech people think everyone is tech literate but my spouse would have no idea how to set it up. Could be a little more plan and simplified.

Alexa does not interact with HUE bulbs as easily as they make it seem, and that was the whole reason I bought this dumb Alexa thing on prime day; wanted to control my lights. I dont think Phillip's knows about this either. On Phillips' site, they say that when you screw in the bulb, Alexa should auto recognize via bluetooth and discover it.\n\nThis is not true however. The Alexa needs a skill installed first to use hue bulbs. The problem is that the skill REQUIRES a HUE bridge. But the description for the Alexa v3 and the HUE bulbs both say you dont need the bridge. Under the description of the skill, when finding it in the Alexa app, v3 echo is not listed anywhere as being supported for the skill.\n\nSo no, it does not seamlessly integrate with HUE bulbs as advertised. And you will need a bridge. I even called tech support from amazon, which was a huge waste of 40min, and they were as stumped as I was.\n\nFirst off the guy tried to walk me through everything I'd done already and wouldn't listen to me about what I had done. I'm a software tester and know how to troubleshoot thanks, I only call tech support when I've exhausted all options elsewhere.\n\nEVEN THE TECH SUPPORT DIDNT KNOW ABOUT THE SKILL NOT BEING COMPATIBLE.\n\nHe was absolutely sure all I needed was the skill, but wouldn't listen to me when I told him what the skill page directly says:\n\n\"The Phillip's Hue smartphone functionality is only compatible with the Phillip's Hue Bridge V2.\"\n\nTech supports instructions:\n\n\"Wait for the Alexa to update since it is fresh out of the box then try again.\"\n\nSo I asked:\n\n\"So when the Alexa updates, the app updates also?\"\n\nResponse:\n\n\"Well no. Because the app is through the apple/google store.\"\n\nMe:\n\nThen why would waiting for the Alexa itself to update, when the skill YOU ARE SAYING I MUST HAVE says it doesn't work without a bridge regardless of version?\n\nResponse:\n\nSir just please try and let us know.\n\nThat's when I ended the call. Useless idiots who refuse to listen to the customer. I'll be contacting CS and asking for a refund due to false advertising.

What is there is so primitive, I just dismissed even considering using it.\n3- Apple Music integration doesn’t have all the futures you expect from iTunes Player.\n4- No support for ITunes Match service.\n\nBottom line is that I am a happy owner of 3x Echo Dots and will add more if these issues are resolved. issues I listed here can be resolved via software updates and it is my hope Amazon will come to its senses and not compete with Apple Music service this way by limiting consumers."},{"reviewerName":"jp","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Love.","reviewDate":"February 12, 2019","reviewText":"I love it.

Wong","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Echo Dot 3rd gen or Google Home Mini? I went with Google Home Mini after playing around for a week.","reviewDate":"February 6, 2019","reviewText":"I know this is a sensitive topic and I bet some will disagree with me and some will agree. Anyways, don't get me wrong, I think they are both great personal assistant products and have areas where one performs better than the other and it was a very tough decision. It is hard to give either Google Home Mini or Echo Dot a five star as I think many would agree that they need much more improvements. If you already have a smart home setup and deep into the Amazon ecosystem and happy with it, then Echo Dot is most likely your pick. However, if you are new to Smart Home world like myself and is not tied into either ecosystem yet, then I would probably go with Google Home Mini.\n\nOne of the main features I love about Echo Dot that Google does not have is the 2 way Intercom feature, Google home had similar feature but it is not as convenient as Echo Dot where you can \"drop in\" to a specific speaker and start a 2 way conversation. Google broadcast to all speakers and to reply, you have to actually say reply. Echo Dot also seem to pick up the wake up word a tiny bit better than Google, just need to speak a bit louder. Both not too big of deal for me personally for not having, and I bet Google will have an answer to that in near future.\n\nMany reviews compares how much Echo Dot 3 sound is better than Google Home Mini and how you can pair it up as stereo speakers... in my opinion, better sound may be true but only for listening to music because the bass is heavier, however, when it comes to conversation/requests, it feels a bit muffled because of this (some other reviews mentioned something similar) and Google felt more crisp in that sense. In addition, since I'm not a music enthusiast, I find Google Home Mini is sufficient for me; Echo Dot only sounds a bit better to my amateur ears and not enough to count against the mini; if I'm a music enthusiast, then I probably won't be counting neither to be my music speaker anyways :)... on that same note, I won't be using Dot as my stereo speakers. I did install multiple Home Mini in my house and I would just be playing same music throughout the house (different floors and rooms) and actually don't want it to be paired in stereo mode. In addition, since my main purpose of having the speaker is to act as a smart home/personal assistant, which I think Google Home Mini sound is more clear and comfortable to the ear when having a \"conversation\".\n\nI also like the idea of Echo Dot's Whisper mode (Google Home Mini only has Night mode based on manually set time period) but it still needs some improvements... in order for it to whisper back to you, you really need to Whisper to it (speaking softly is not the same as whisper), so not really useful for me at the moment... :(\n\nLast but not least, many tests/reports indicates how Google Assistant is head of Amazon, Apple, and MS when it comes to accuracy/smartness (which is definitely my main factor to consider for such a product) which I have played around myself with both Echo Dot and Home Mini and I tend to agree.\n\nAbove are things that had been pulling me apart when trying to deciding which side to go with so hope you find them useful when making your decision."},{"reviewerName":"LarryC","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Sounds better than gen 2 and fits our decor better","reviewDate":"January 31, 2019","reviewText":"It's an Alexa Dot that does just what the last Dot did, so there's not a lot to say other than the sound has a bit more bass and is \"fuller\" and nicer sounding than the o4 gen 2 Dots we have around our home.

They make listening to music so easy and fun compared to the days of using CD's.\nI have a number of devices in my home from lights to cameras that I love to control with Alexa as well. I spent a couple of years using google home because at the time the google home mini had a much better speaker. I connect to stereos in some rooms, but others, like a bathroom it is nice to listen in the shower without having a larger expensive device taking up space. I have now had Alexa for a while and am happy I made the switch from google, but there are some things that may keep techie people from making that switch. I quickly realized (since I use these devices for more than the most basic stuff) that there are a lot of areas that seem to get ignored or maybe it just takes a couple years to figure out...\n\nPros:\n\n- Allowing devices to trigger routines is in the works and is awesome! Need more device support for switches and motion sensors!\n\n-Alexa is so easy to say! I would much rather be able to name my assistant, but this was well thought out compared to \"okay google\" (saying that command got old fast)\n\n-The Alexa app is pretty good, it is easy enough to figure out.\n\n-I can control my smart lights well.\n\n-I found a great 3rd party app for integrating my shopping lists and notes (anylist). The shopping list feature was terrible on google.\n\n-I love listening to music by voice and making playlists.\n\n-Echo Devices connect perfectly to stereo equipment with AV to Aux cords making a huge sound upgrade.\n\n-The price is great for all it can do.\n\n-Routines are so useful, unfortunately this feature is mostly a Con for me.\n\n-The speaker sounds pretty good, not quite as good as google mini (maybe debatable) but not far enough behind to be a deal breaker.\n\nCons:\n\n-Routines need a ton of improvement. Google home had the ability to type custom commands into your routines. This allowed the user to string multiple commands together using one phrase. With Echo there are no custom command abilities, you cannot control most of your skills through routines. When you start playing around with it you realize it is very limited compared with google home. I don't know why they let them have the edge here! This one is tough to not be frustrated about despite the technology being so great. I could have so much more function in my smart home than what they are limiting us to.\n\n-I do have weird server issues , mostly streaming amazon music. I seem to have to reset my echos occasionally to fix this (about every two weeks). I have a mesh wifi network (orbi) with great signal strength so I can't imagine improving on that.\n\n-The devices have a delay in the response most of the time, I remember google being right there. I still rather say Alexa though. Okay google is an awkward mouthful.\n\n-Alexa's voice volume really needs to be separated from the music volume. If you turn down the music you can no longer hear your assistant!\n\n-I cannot continue music in another room once starting somewhere else.\n\nAll in all I think they have created an amazing piece of technology, and they are the leader here. I hope they start listening more to customers who use the advanced features.

First, you will not be able to use it with some accessories, like certain wall plug holders or any device that depends on the diameter to be like version 2. The diameter is larger and the periphery has the speaker grille which cannot be covered up obviously. Secondly, the audio level, compared to gen 2 is lower. If you have routines that set the audio level or if you use voice commands to set the level, you will need to adjust upward to achieve the same audio level. My routine that sets the level to 2 needed to be increased to level 4 for the same loudness. I believe this applies to the Bluetooth level as well, which the Dot remembers separately.

I have created routines and still learning new things. I plan to buy another Echo--the larger Gen 2 with a better speaker to play music but will still use this Echo Dot for many tasks. Echo Dot does not have excellent sound -- and that's why 4 stars and not 5 -- but I am 100% satisfied with it's functionality and that it is an inexpensive introduction to the Alexa wifi virtual assistant technology that I intend to expand in my home."},{"reviewerName":"S. Ghoddoucy","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great voice assistant & AI","reviewDate":"April 17, 2019","reviewText":"As a long-time iPhone and Siri user, I’m super impressed with Alexa’s fast reaction and accuracy. It really puts Siri to shame. Alexa correctly understands my commands over 99% of the time and immediately performs them. I use it to tune into SiriusXM channels and my local NPR station, play music through Apple Music, listen to news headlines, get the weather, and connect to my phone for a Bluetooth speaker when I want better audio than my phone’s speakers. I also use it to turn off my tv (it’s sadly too old to turn on with Alexa, but off will do). Alexa’s technology and “skills” (aka apps) really seem to work seamlessly. It makes me want to upgrade my existing home gadgets, which mostly lack smart home features, sooner so I can fully avail myself of Alexa’s smart home capabilities. My usage is still fairly basic. I don’t use Alexa to make calls, or read or send messages/emails because I think some of those functions are limited to contacts who have Alexa devices, and others just seem like major security/privacy breaches waiting to happen. I also don’t use Alexa to do Amazon orders because I want to be able to price shop and know exactly what I’m getting before the order goes through. But overall, I’m impressed with its technology and capabilities. Shocking that Amazon beat Apple here so roundly."},{"reviewerName":"Hari","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Better than previous version — Not the BEST","reviewDate":"June 15, 2019","reviewText":"Hi, I will go with my comparison to google home mini.\n\nPositive Side: Sound quality got better and voice recognition got better than the previous versions.\nVolume level is higher than google home mini and also attractive with those lights around the speaker.\n\nNegative side: First thing i noticed was the charging pin was changed from previous versions and no longer supports your android phone chargers.

Setup is much faster than the older gens, not that they were difficult, now it’s Bluetooth. The look has been cleaned up, curvy and a little bigger than the old models. Better color choices, I got sandstone. Although as many other reviewers have said it does pretty much the same things as the old ones but has Noticeably better sound and ability to hear you correctly if at all. Downside, they changed the plug...it’s now just straight AC with a bulky wall plug as opposed to the basically universal micro usb. I don’t know why amazon would do this. If they are saying it’s better, inside, faster etc. then if they wanted to change the plug, which WHY?! then they should have went tic USB-c since it’s backwards compatible, high speed data transfers and charging, plus people have them, now if it breaks you have to buy their one of plug...

My old dot would wake me up even if the internet was out. This one does but you can't turn it off without unplugging. The final straw was when I reset it up last night after having unplugged our modem to change the plugs around.

We currently have 5 total in our house -- two 2nd generations + three 3rd generations -- and the sound quality of the 3rd generation is far superior. While the unit itself may be little, these provide perfect (and booming, if you want!) ambience for parties, endless entertainment for kids (try, \"Alexa, tell me bedtime story!\"), and a great & accessible hub for controlling smart house functions.\n\nFor the not-quite-perfect aspects, we've had a bit of trouble with the voice recognition at times. Not only does Alexa refuse to pronounce my name even remotely right, she often misunderstands (I'd say once out of every 5 commands) and sometimes has trouble connecting to the internet, even with a strong signal.\n\nThat being said, the pros definitely outweigh the cons (really, quite negligible for the benefits), and for the affordable price of the dot, this is a must have!"},{"reviewerName":"Jeremy Wadhams","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Wow, significantly better speaker than 2nd gen","reviewDate":"October 22, 2019","reviewText":"I replaced the 2nd gen echo dot in my daughter's room with this 3rd gen, then took her 2nd gen for my office.

After a few hours (!!) of trying we got the dot hooked up. The problem really is the app - among the worst I've ever worked with. The first issue was that there were no instructions for setting it up from a computer, so I went to my phone and the app store. WARNING: there are several apps with similar names to the set-up app that are bogus - even one of Amazon's that just kept trying to upgrade me to subscriptions for Alexa.\n\nWe got the right app installed, but it kept glitching. After 3 times thru the process with no success, my wife tried to set it up with her phone. Same issues. Mostly it kept telling us \"the device is not registered,\" then directing us to click on something which took us right back to where we started. She gave up and I tried again. The app finally directed me how to \"register\" the device, but that step had not come up before.\n\nAmazon did reach out to me after my initial negative review and offer to help, but by then we were done. I appreciate the contact, but better instructions sent with the echo dot or available online or a much better app is really the answer."},{"reviewerName":"D & J Stephens","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Power supply hogs outlet.","reviewDate":"December 11, 2018","reviewText":"I like the new look. I will fit in room decor easier. The sound quality is much better than the earlier model, which is the only reason I will keep this one.\nThe power supply (wall charger), has a larger \"foot print\" and tends to hog the plug outlet, especially the location of the exit point of the cord, not allowing anything else to be plugged in next to it. Also, the cord is permanently attached to the power supply, not allowing the same flexibility of using the traditional USB plug, for routing the wire. I'm assuming that is because the new model has more power needs than the previous models, and they want to be sure we use only the original power cord.\nSo, I will keep this 3rd generation Dot, but I won't be replacing my 2nd generation dots any time soon."},{"reviewerName":"Stylianos","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"So much better then the other generations, used as speaker for pc","reviewDate":"April 24, 2019","reviewText":"I have had Alexa products since they first came out, and with my new pc (no speakers set up) I decided to get one of the 3rd gen in order to use it as a bluetooth speaker for my gaming pc.\nWorks great.

What's up with that? I formerly used an older Dot on powered speakers (PreSonus Eris E3.5) and I used to be able to set the volume at 50%. With this new 3rd gen Dot, I have to set the volume to 100% to get the same volume.\n\nSo, all other things being equal, it would seem this new Dot robs your system (if using 3.5mm) of half its power.

Nowadays, there's so many things that use the 2.4 band (including your microwave!) that the bandwidth gets used up and everything slows down.

We now have the Echo (2nd gen) plus four Gen 3 Dots. This gives us an Alexa connection in all the most used areas of the house. The Dots have very good sound considering their size. The intercom feature is nice, and the grouping feature works great. It's nice to walk from room to room and hear the same music in perfect synch in each room. I will look into hooking up to our Bose radios in the future to get even better sound. The only problem with that is that doing so will disable the internal speaker, so I will either have to disconnect the Bose, or leave it on ($$ + energy). Since I ordered 2 Dots at a time, I had one setup problem. As I went through the setup, it did not complete, and when restarted thought I was doing the second Dot, not the one I was working on. It may be because I tried to rename it during the setup process. The problem was easily diagnosed when I said \"Alexa, say device name\" and the response was not the correct name.

That's wonderful. also, if I'm sleeping and don't want to wake up to look at my clock I just ask Alexa what time it is! I really enjoy having this ECHO DOT in my bedroom!

I'm slowly adding smart home features and I thought it would be nice to try both - especially the newest Dot. Set-up was fairly easy. I have the Dot in my bedroom on a bedside table. I set up a morning routine without any trouble. Sound is pretty good - when I start my morning routine I get a breakdown of the weather, traffic, and then I have Alexa stream music from Spotify. The music WAS clear and loud enough for me to hear in the shower. Unfortunetly, as I was going through my routine this morning, the music started to have static sounds in it. When I asked Alexa for the time, her voice was popping and had static in it as well. I'm pretty bummed because I've had bluetooth speakers for years and they never started to sound like this.

I can ask it to play any of my favorite songs by any artist and it never disappoints me. Listening to music and radio has never been easier! No CD's put put in and take out and no turning on my radio. I just ask Alexa to play my favorite stations, my own prime music or any thing I want to hear. It works best if you choose a music plan though. I chose the unlimited music plan and added my husband so he can also listen to his music too. The cost of the unlimited music plan is so very affordable. That is one of the best things about it having an Echo. I can listen to any type of music I want and there is really no need to buy a physical CD anymore unless I just want to. I am in my 60's and for me, it's so much easier just to ask Alexa to play my music. That is my main purpose for using it. I am thinking of getting another dot for my kitchen so I can listen while I cook. The sound is very good and can be adjusted if needed. I have a hearing loss but can hear it very well. If you want the sound to fill a large room, I suggest you the the regular Echo. It has a broader range of sound and a better speaker than the dot. But for my own personal use, the dot suits me well.

Even when I am out, I can use the Alexa app to call someone's device and talk to them.\n2) Order Updates. I love that Alexa can tell me when an Amazon package will be coming in AND she sends me a notification when it is dropped off at my door. You can also enable the UPS skill and log into your UPS account and she can track your UPS packages for you (genius).\n3) Routines. I say, \"Alexa, Start My Day\" and she plays the news for me, tells me the weather, tells me an interesting fact about the current day, etc. etc. I also have a few \"Smart Plugs\" connected and I created a routine where I say \"Alexa, Goodnight\" and she turns off my bedroom lights and turns my box fan on. And it can all be changed to my liking in the Alexa App.\n4) Skills. There are thousands of games and skills that are being added, so when they say Alexa is always getting smarter, they mean it.\n\nTo sum it all up, buy an Echo device.

It can even create a playlist around a theme or based off a certain song, just ask Alexa. Got mine on Prime Day for $20.

If you tell her to connect to your iPad - and the iPad's bluetooth is off, it will connect to the iPhone instead and you waste 5 minutes to go find it and turn that bluetooth off. Moving from one echo to another with bluetooth is a pain as well.\nSound quality is ok, loudness could be better for certain YouTube videos. Too much base for TV shows, etc. maybe ok for music.\nAfter recent forced update, Alexa voice recognition got worse, you have to say commands 2-3 times, before they work. It definitely got worse after 7 months of use.\nthe intelligence part of Alexa for sure needs improvement."},{"reviewerName":"Chris","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Does what I wanted it for -Ask My Buddy","reviewDate":"January 1, 2019","reviewText":"I got this for the sole purpose of using the \"ask my buddy\" app. I am a senior, living alone. I used to keep a land line phone in my basement, at floor level, in case I fall down the stairs. When I got rid of my land line, I no longer had a call for help solution. With the investment of $25 (on sale) the echo dot sits in the basement, pretty much unused, but it's a big weight off my mind knowing it's there. I test the wifi signal every morning by yelling down the stairs asking the temperature. And have it play the radio when I am doing laundry.

We loved the features on it so much, we ordered a 3rd gen to use in the front of the house. The 3rd gen speakers are so much better than the 2nd get (not anything like a sound system but perfectly adequate for christmas music!) that we ordered another 3rd gen to replace our 2nd gen. This version is also more aesthetically pleasing, as it comes in a softer look and softer colors than the stark black or white of gen 2. It's not a giant brick on your countertop.\nNot only is it super easy to set up, but it actually understands what you're saying. We're an apple household but Siri just sucks when you're trying to get it to understand you.

I'm not a fan of being tied to a special power adapter like this. I like having options for power delivery that the previous generations had. It's bigger and heavier, the sound quality is improved over the 2nd gen. I still miss the ring from the first gen. But bring back USB power.

Also found a way to dig through the settings to manually pair my, and others, devices to her Bluetooth. The device is also very small and looks really good (I have mine in my office area and my boss never noticed for the first 2 weeks until someone else brought it up, and then he thoughts it was pretty cool). The sound quality is pretty good despite the form factor (Does best with highs and mids, but as long as it’s not a bass tester or something super heavy in bass it sounds really good even at max volume. I play mostly hip-hop, 60/70’s Psychedelic, and House/Deep House music and have had no complaints as far as sound quality. Plus it doesn’t rattle, even at max).\n\nThat’s where the positive ends though.\n\nThe app for the speaker is completely garbage and useless. The only thing on there is the backdoor to the settings so that once you manually pair the speaker to your device (and I highly recommend you do it this way, as speaking to her to do it is extremely tedious and frustrating), and the time and weather (which I can get off my phone or watch’s lock screen a lot easier). All of the in “skills” (sub-apps) for music streams are junk and don’t work (most of the time won’t even boot, or if they do you have zero control over them) and it’s just a nightmare. You would think a trillion dollar company like Amazon, who’s trying to push these smart speakers into every home and office, would be able to come up with a simple and functional app with working “skills”.\n\nBottom line it’s a good Bluetooth speaker that can tell you your local weather or play a trivia game with you. If the app was fixed and 3rd party apps were better supported it would be a great speaker that I would buy for my home.

Lastly, I just upgraded the TC in the bedroom to a smart UHD TV with WiFi AND Alexa. Yep, I can use alexa to change channels, volume, watch youtube, or nextflix, etc. with no remote. So cool.

My friends use it to set timers for their kids and ask for conversion measurements while cooking.

I’m actually more curious about the sound of two 3rd gen Dots in stereo with the sub-woofer, then using two Echos with it.\n\nI found out you can’t have an Echo and a Dot in stereo. I only wanted to try them like that on opposite sides of a large room to hear the different mixes more isolated, and blending as I move between them. Viva la difference... maybe. Oh well. So much for being a musician and wanting to hear the instruments differently, and more isolated.\n\nActually, what I did right before I got the new Dot, was connect the Echo to a 2.1 sound system and that just sounds awesome. That’s the way to go; I would say, but I still like the Dot and Echo in mono unison as well, depending on the situation obviously.\n\nUpdate:\nI found the EQ in Sounds setting, so now I like it even more. I’ve only heard one album so far, but for now, the EQ settings in the photo really enhanced the sound.

First off, the setup could use some work, it was kind of confusing and very convoluted. It took at least 3 separate tries to setup the first Echo Dot, it would get partially through a software update and then fail with an error. I had no clue if I was doing something wrong, and was about to the point of just returning them out of frustration. Finally on the third try the software update finally went through and voila, it said setup was complete. I thought a miracle had happened. I tested a few things, and Alexa responded as expected. When I went to setup the 2nd Echo Dot, expecting the same amount of struggle, and it literally was done in a few seconds. I had no issues whatsoever. I don't know if the first unit was able to share information with it, or what the issue was but it was done and working in no time, and it was farther away from my WiFi routher than the first one is. Weird.\n\nThen I hit another frustration point, when I tried to setup Alexa to launch Netflix and Hulu on my Firestick 4K. When I tried to activate the Netflix and Hulu video skills in Alexa, for the life of me I couldn't figure it out, and had no idea what I was doing wrong. I think Alexa was confused because there were multiple Fire TV devices on my account, and she didn't know which one to launch the program on. Finally out of frustration I unlinked/de-registered the other devices since I was not going to be using them anyway, and voila, it started working. It was all very confusing and frustrating, but in the end I finally got it working. It seems to be a useful product, and have already configured smart plugs to turn on lights. I really like being able to get information instantly, like when does a store close in my area, etc. I hope to learn more useful things it can be used for. However, it still feels sorta stupid to be talking to a machine, but maybe I'll get past that.

It only took a day to realize that while it responds affirmatively when you request it to Shuffle the songs in a Playlist, it actually only Shuffles the first song and then plays the following songs in alphabetical order by artist. This means in a Playlist with 1,000+ songs I have to listen to dozens of consecutive songs by a single artist. That's hours worth of Radiohead before I get to hear a Wilco song. Also, when you hear a song in Apple Music you want to download to your Library, it is unable to do so. It seems the consensus is these will not be fixed anytime soon since Amazon and Apple have competing streaming music services and of course, Amazon wants you to use theirs.

Great sound and responds to voice commands really well. We use ours in our kitchen and I love using the timer feature. It's easy to set a timer on my stove, but Alexa makes it even more hands-free. Some times my hands and fingers are dirty, so I feel it is a nice bonus to have that ability via a simple voice command. It's our first one so I can't compare it to the 2nd gen ones that I've read about, but I love this one. We bought my Dad a Google mini, because he has used his girlfriends in the past and he's not too tech savvy so I didn't want to throw him off, but I like my Alexa much better. I don't know why, but I just think Alexa responds to my voice much easier and knows exactly what I need. BONUS is the added Amazon prime music. We are prime members and it is much easier to find the music we want to listen to on the echo vs. the Google mini. Google mini only seemed to give \"related\" music stations to what you are searching for. For instance, Johnny cash. Google only gave us a station that played his music occasionally or more often, songs that they considered similar; while Alexa just gave us Johnny Cash (which is what we wanted). If I want 90's alternative, it gave me 90's alternative. This is our first time using the prime music feature with out prime membership and I don't know why we've waited this long. Now we didn't purchase anything extra with the Google mini, music-wise, so that might make a difference. But with the Alexa we would never have to (along with our prime membership which we already had). I'm not tech savvy in anyway, so if you want to get in detailed specs and such, I can't offer that review! we will be purchasing more!!!"},{"reviewerName":"Kristy Hudson","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Good but much much less functional than expected. Real problems with Australian amazon accounts.","reviewDate":"March 13, 2019","reviewText":"I bought this product to explore the Alexa/Amazon universe for the first time. I intended to use it with my two Amazon Fire TVs that I had just acquired. The echo dot is *good-ish*, but there were a lot of problems, rather than everything working \"straight out of the box\".\n\n1. Initially, all of the TV control functions would not work, and on investigation the entire menu section in the Alexa App for TV controls was missing. It took weeks to figure out what was going on: Amazon had decided the device was being used in Australia, and although they don't tell you this at all, Amazon chooses not to let Australian users control their TV through Echo Dot. I don't know why. Although I bought the Echo Dot in USA, bought the TV in USA, downloaded the Alexa App from the USA iTunes store and am using it in the USA, I once used to live in Australia. This was frustrating as all of the \"Help\" sites said \"navigate to the TV settings in your Alexa app\" and this whole section was missing. I eventually solved this after several weeks, but it involved having to fundamentally change settings across my entire Amazon account.\n\n2. After I solved this, I discovered that, unlike my trusty Google Home devices which can control multiple fire TVs, the Echo Dot can only be paired with one Amazon Fire TV. Really annoying, as this also limits me using the other TV as a speaker.\n\n3. Since then, I have battled to get Alexa to actually control the TV it is paired with. It can definitely turn it on and off, but after that... well if there's a solution, I haven't cracked it. I've stopped using the Alexa and have gone back to using my Google Home as my primary \"media control\" device.\n\n4. Echo Dot and Alexa refuse to acknowledge my Audible account. Well, no, that's not quite true. They won't acknowledge my Audible.com.au account, which I log into using my Amazon.com username and password. Australian Audible is not OK. The only way I can listen to an audiobook using the Echo Dot is to start a new Audible.com (not Audible.com.au) account, and re-buy the books I want to listen to. As you can imagine, I am underwhelmed.\n\n5. I use Alexa/Echo Dot to control my wifi lights at home, and it generally works well... adding new lights was not difficult once I understood the process, and grouping them into rooms has worked well.\n\n6. I use simple routines with the Echo Dot/Alexa such as good morning and good night, which play me morning news, tell me the weather and turn the lights on/off as needed. Not bad, but REALLY limited as to what information I can have played in my morning feed compared to Google Home.\n\n7. She doesn't love my Australian accent. Sigh. Nothing I can do about that. Oh well.\n\nSo.... for me, the Echo Dot has not lived up to the hype. The advertising implies it can do many things, but in actual practice, it turns out it's mostly just a voice-activated speaker, and Amazon has chosen to be really difficult about country codes. I'm not a google fan per se, but in comparison, the Google environment works much much better."},{"reviewerName":"Maryam","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Amazon does it again!","reviewDate":"September 25, 2019","reviewText":"I love my Echo Dot!

You will not regret it.\n\nThe previous Echo Dot was very tinny and could not fill a larger room with sound. It would probably work for a small room like a bedroom, but obviously, the idea that Jeff B. is listening in makes that less palatable for many people. The new Echo Dot is probably ideal for a kitchen, office or smaller living room - anything larger needs the full-size Echo to act as a small stereo.\n\nWe now have 4 Echo devices throughout our house and a group so music can play throughout (also can do announcements for the kids to ignore \"Dinner's Ready\").\n\nFinal thoughts: Don't get the Gen 2.

Also, if she does not hear you clearly, expect a 5 minute explanation of some movie or book named “lights” at full volume at when you are trying to get up for work.

So far I've seen that it definitely has better long range hearing, as in it can actually hear you from across the room, and given the LED strip around the edge, it seems to actually be able to figure out a pretty accurate direction on where you're talking to it from. It also understands commands better than Google, though granted it can't do everything. Right now I have it mounted to the wall next to my stereo, and I used to have it hooked up to the stereo by 3.5mm aux port, but due to some issues with that it's just linked to the stereo by Bluetooth now. When connected by 3.5mm, songs will suddenly stop playing through the stereo, but the Alexa app says they're still going, and it seems like the only fix is to skip or restart the song. Bluetooth does not have this problem, however if I had some suggestions for software updates in the future, they'd be this: when the Echo is linked to a stereo either by Bluetooth or aux port, ALL the audio comes through the aux device, even Alexa just answering questions. I'd suggest putting in an option for the Echo to have regular Alexa voice come through its own speakers and music go through the aux device, at least giving the user a choice to choose from. I'd also suggest if that option became available, that the Echo lets Bluetooth linked devices and stereos sleep when inactive, and when given the command to play media, gives the wake command to the device before playing.\n\nAll in all though, it's been pretty nice, definitely worth the price, and is definitely my choice for playing music."},{"reviewerName":"Pattyb","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"I love my Echo Dot(s).","reviewDate":"February 13, 2019","reviewText":"Let’s face it.

I am told it accepts both English and German although my high school German is way too old to test.\n\nI do not live in a 'smart' house so I did not test any of the remote device management capabilities (turn on/off lamps, unlock/lock doors etc.) nor did I use it for things like creating shopping lists. Although Alexa can provide local traffic reports my 'Droid app from a local TV station is much faster.\n\nI suspect the most common use will be playing music (a trial period of Amazon Music comes with (I don't intend to renew at $3.99/month) but I have found that full of shortcomings:\n\n1. Requesting a specific song might get you the original or it might get you a re-recording of the original.\n2. A request for an album or genre will probably result in unwanted repeats of a single song (also happened with\nNPR News summary as well).\n3. Amazon claims to have 50 million songs out there but there are a ton of common titles that I have never heard\nof and there are many popular personal favorites missing.\n4. Requesting something like \"play Hawaiian Instrumentals\" results in vocal recordings and a request to play harp\nmusic was not understood. Not sure what's up with that. I'm amazed at how good its vocal interpretation is but it\nis still a long way from perfect.\n5. And the WORST shortcoming - the audio level is very inconsistent between songs. Playing the Echo Dot on your\nbedside while trying to go to sleep results in songs barely heard to the next one blasting you off your pillow.\nVery irritating! And, the volume buttons on top of the puck are not lighted and hard to find if the room is dark.\n\nOn the plus side it does a reasonable job of finding a specific song or album (played in shuffle mode) and you can\nbuild your own personal playlist(s) if you wish.\n\nMy granddaughter is going to be pleased with it because she loves to give it math problems. Saves her a bunch of\ntime doing homework. It is also useful as a clock radio (wake to music of your choice) but its rumored ability to\nrecord everything around it might not be what you want in the bedroom (especially if your girlfriend's name is\n'Alexa'). You can shut the microphone off but I'm unsure if that actually does what you would think.\n\nI did notice that with unit not used for several days, even with the mic and notifications turned off, it starts\nblinking - irritating.\n\nIt does have a mini stereo jack connection so earbuds do work and you do get full stereo out of the earbuds. The\ninternal speaker sounds mono but it isn't bad at low audio levels. It will reportedly connect via Bluetooth to an\nexternal speaker although I did not try that. You can also set 2 Dot's up to create a stereo speaker although I\nunderstand there may be issues getting that to work correctly.\n\nI usually watch the local TV news while eating breakfast but if you don't do that this gadget will give you the\nnews from several optional sources while you eat. I did notice it repeats stories from time to time and appears to\nbe caught in a loop. I never found it very useful because not very many news sources are available.\n\nMy summary: it is a moderately useful gadget but not worth the money it costs (somewhere between $40-$100 on the\nopen market)."},{"reviewerName":"Z","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"A great entry level smart device!","reviewDate":"April 7, 2019","reviewText":"This thing has been really cool (I have 2 of them). My only complaints are that 1.) the audio quality is different between the two units, with one being slightly more muffled as you add bass, and 2.) it seems like the longer it stays plugged in, the slower it responds when you call it, kind of like a memory leak. I got my second unit at a drastic discount when I bought the first, so I'd say they're still an excellent deal.

I was in the garage a few days ago and was listening to Glenn Miller when the dot fell off my work bench and into an empty 5 gallon plastic bucket. All of a sudden this robust sound I had never heard from a Dot came roaring out. My garage Dot now hangs from a hook inside a bucket. It has a much better sound than the Echo which is pretty impressive on it's own. Go drop your Dot in a bucket and enjoy a new and improved sound.

I created a group for all the echo speakers and can play music from anywhere I want and it is great to hear all the speakers playing in sync. Gives a great surround sound feeling if setup correctly. Would have liked it more if it was possible for them to play in sync when connected with Bluetooth. As of now we can only connect them in sync if we are using some streaming service to play music. If used with bluetooth, only one speaker will play music that you have your bluetooth device connected to.

I was expecting to be able to simply have a conversation with the Echo Dot and it would have a conversation back with me, but it seems it's not the case exactly.

Alexa knew more random facts and was able to keep things up faster than Google and honestly she was more entertaining, but functionally she was disappointing. The emails should you need for each and every little action gets tiring. Want to download a song on your streaming service, download the skill. Want to connect to other smart devices or equipment, download a skill. And the worst part is, the skills are buggy as all get out. The save songs skill worked for a day and then Alexa would say, \"you need to download a skill for that\". I tried connecting her to my 4 Phillips Hue lights and she created 8 lights and then wouldn't turn them off if called by their nickname. She was unable to turn off my Samsung TV for a while until I changed it's name to \"TV\". She can't turn off my Vizio or do anything with my Fire Stick. Unfortunately the list goes on. It doesn't have as loud a speaker system as Google Home either so I don't know why I even got it. I thought the voice assistant would be useful but Google is way ahead in that department too.

I tried to unplug it and re-plug it, but the light was still green. I felt someone was listening in on me even though Alexa said there were no drop-ins or phone calls.

I set them up in my parents house as a Christmas present. My parents are not easy to shop for. If they really want something, they buy it themselves. So, every year I have to figure out what they want, but they just don’t know they want it yet. The best gifts are usually things that will make their lives easier. We’re starting out slow. They’re using it to find out what the temperature is in various cities, the score of the game, when the next game is on, setting a timer, and the answer to various questions throughout the day. Then I taught them to make shopping lists with Alexa, and to talk to each other from opposite ends of the house. Next, I might pair them with some Philips Hue bulbs.

The upgrades (sound quality + aesthetics) are nowhere near enough to make up for the fact that I have to pay $20 when one of their very fragile cords fails. My cat took one nibble on the cord, bam, dead echo.\n\nOn previous versions of the echo dot, I could replace the existing usb cord with any usb cord of my choice, allowing me to get a superior product at an affordable price. This allowed me to customize the cord to something that was a color of my choice, length of my choice, and most importantly in my particular case - made of cat-deterring materials.\n\nI'm not blaming Amazon for not making their cords cat-proof, that's not their responsibility. I am, however, very upset at the realization that I could previously give another company my $5-10 and get a cord that will outlast my echo dot, is customized to my tastes, and can function as a usb cord for all the wonderful things they do.\n\nAmazon knows that that $5-10 only sometimes goes to them in the form of an Amazon-Basics usb cable because they have to provide competitive pricing with everyone else in the usb market. So they replace that interface with an inferior cable they can sell exclusively for $20 and cut out the competition? Those seems like questionable motives to me...\n\nAmazon, if you're reading this review... please let me know if I can send back my 3rd generation echo dots in exchange for your 2nd generation models.

I received the Alexa when I purchased the Alexa microwave on a deal and the Google Home as a gift. Alexa is great for playing Prime music and searching songs up. The Alexa tends to not hear voice commands from about 15 ft away and you typically have to yell in order for the Alexa to hear you. Google Home allows you to whisper and it can still pick you up in the same room. We have asked Alexa simple questions about our local restaurants and it either skips over many well-known food chains in the area or did not know how to search for it.\n\nAlexa is good for letting you know about your Amazon packages and will alert you on that. It's also good to make and receive phone calls on it, which can replace a landline if you don't mind it always being on speaker. Many people have said the microphones are hard to hear and sound like there is a lot of static, which can explain why Alexa tends to struggle to pick up voice commands.\n\nOverall, I would recommend Alexa if you like to do a lot of voice shopping, like telling Alexa to purchase laundry detergent. Alexa is also good if you have Prime and like to listen to Prime music frequently. However, if you ask Alexa google search questions, Alexa will struggle compared to Google Home."},{"reviewerName":"Brenda","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"WOW!!!

When this new one came out with a new shape & color & a special Prime price, decided it would be perfect for the kitchen over by the stove to hear while cooking etc. The color is beautiful & perfect for my kitchen. The sound is fantastic. The original dots are just fine for talk radio but this new one is fabulous for listening to music too. Seriously thinking of replacing the other echo dots. :)"},{"reviewerName":"Donald T.","rating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Very Poor quality sound","reviewDate":"July 5, 2019","reviewText":"I much prefer the gen 2 Dot. This one has very muddy and distorted sound It sounds ok playing music, but I don't use it for music, that's what my desktop computer is for. When I ask Alexa something, I can barely understand her. The gen 2 Dot is much better for what I use it for.\nSuggestion to Amazon: incorporate some kind of EQ.\nUpdate:\nI have never had any problems with Amazon returns, until now. I sent these back a week ago and customer service says it can be another 2 weeks before I get my refund, even though they have the items back."},{"reviewerName":"Doctor B","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"An incredible upgrade from 2nd Gen version!","reviewDate":"July 31, 2019","reviewText":"Toss your old 1st and 2nd Gen Echo Dots and get the new the 3rd Gen. The latest 3rd Gen version is waaay better! The 3rd Gen Echo Dot is like a 2019 Ferrari compared to the 2nd Gen Echo Dot which is a like a 1989 Pontiac Fiero.\nMy quadriplegic nephew uses the 2nd Gen Echo Dot to control TV, listen to music, etc and it has been a God send. However, he needed to repeat his commands almost half the time with the 2nd Gen Dot. The new 3rd Gen Echo Dot hears his commands the 1st time about 90% of times. The sound quality on the new version is also way better. The new version has more bass, treble, higher volume and is just a way better device all around to the point where we were upset we didn't upgrade a lot sooner."},{"reviewerName":"MCT","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"great upgrade","reviewDate":"October 17, 2018","reviewText":"Traded in the first gen dot to this one.

I got a hold of customer service and they just transferred me to Technical Support. They told me someone will be calling me back. They wanted money for me to start out at first but almost $200 and then they went down to $75 and they told me if I didn’t give him the money and within five minutes my product will be shut down they wanted money for me to start it out at first but almost $200 and then they went down to $75 and they told me if I didn’t give them the money and within five minutes my product will be shut down. So in other words I was being scammed. I have never been so pissed off or frustrated in my life for buying a product.

Buy. This. Product!","reviewDate":"November 4, 2019","reviewText":"O.M.G.! The Echo Dot Gen 3 is the best!\n\nFirst, let me start on the voice recognition. It doesn't matter if you're having a huge house party where the music is loud, people talking, etc. The Echo Dot Gen 3 with Alexa integration will in a near instant recognize the call of her name and start listening. It is so good! I cannot even explain how much times I have been grateful for the 4 microphones that can hear my voice, it is HIGHLY convenient.\nNext: the sound quality. The sound quality, I can say, is the best so far for a speaker like this. The sound is crystal clear and I can hear every detail coming from those great speakers, I have nothing to say except that you will not have trouble hearing the highs, mids, and lows produced from this speaker and will be satisfied with the sound quality.\nOverall, the Echo Dot 3rd Generation from Amazon is by far the best smart speaker out the market out there, and I would recommend it to anyone and everyone! Again, the smart speaker has amazing mobility for its size, the price is just right, the speakers crispy clear, and the voice recognition and Alexa integration just sets it way further ahead than other smart speakers out there!"},{"reviewerName":"Rebecca the Reviewer","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Why have I deprived myself of such a device for so long!!!!","reviewDate":"June 8, 2019","reviewText":"Excellent!

I'm hoping to buy a security camera or two (I'll need to purchase cloud space - pretty inexpensive), but there are dozens of such 1080 ppi cameras available, and 3rd Gen Echo/Alexa can give you your own smart security system.

The sound quality on the 3rd generation Echo Dot is much better than the 2nd generation Dot. The sound is like the difference between an AM radio to FM stereo. It's not up to the sound quality of a full size Echo, obviously. But it competes very well with the Google Home Mini, which I have a couple of also. The Alexa echo-system is the preferred voice control system in our household. Voice control is comparable with Google Home, but Alexa covers more of my home automation.

I’ve jumped through their hoops troubleshooting yet they won’t refund me until I live chat with one of their representatives. This is not a requirement for any other product purchased on Amazon and shouldn’t be for the Echo just because it is owned by them.

Purchased (2) Echo Dot speakers for use with Lutron Caseta wireless electrical wall and lamp switches. One Echo Dot placed in family room and other in living room. Everyone in the house now tells Alexia to turn on and off these lights. Alexia is asked to turn lights on at a desired percentage of illumination, change the percent or turn the lights off. Lights come on immediately at desired level and not at full level and down to desired level. The two Echo Dots are our first experience with this product. Besides using the Echo Dots for lighting control we are enjoying all of the information that Alexia can quickly provide, including time, outside temperature, timer, and information on an enormous amount of topics."},{"reviewerName":"David","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Improved sound and package with same great functionality","reviewDate":"December 31, 2018","reviewText":"I purchased the 3rd generation echo dot as an update to my 2nd generation dot. The sound is improved over the last generation, and voice identification is more accurate. Perhaps most noticeably, the newer echo dot is more aesthetically pleasing, and more readily blends in with my furniture.\n\nI use my echo dots primarily to control lighting throughout my house and play music from Amazon music and Spotify. In that regard, the two devices communicate flawlessly with my smart switches, and can play music interchangeably depending on which room I'm in.\n\nIf you're looking to buy your first echo device, I would strongly suggest the echo dot. It has the same functionality as the larger echos, in a smaller package. If you already have a previous generation echo dot, then this device is really only appropriate if you're looking to expand to multiple rooms. There is a modest sound improvement over the 2nd generation dot, but I connect to a wireless speaker, taking sound out of the equation."},{"reviewerName":"Teeter","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Not as good as the older ones.","reviewDate":"March 17, 2019","reviewText":"Doesn’t hear as well as second gen.

Was told by friends that I should get the echo plus for that but the echo dot had great sound quality for the price even beating some of my friends pricier speakers, the sound volume gets loud but not as high a speaker meant for music only. It’s way easier for me to get the music to play than on a simple speaker because it’s voice command vs selecting on your phone (although you can select from your phone). I can ask it for questions on the go or pause it when my family needs me in a hurry. The Skyrim feature is a hoot, so silly. My only problem is that there’s a weird disconnect between the Alexa app and the amazon music app which confuses it. If you use the voice command to ask it to play music it will play amazon music through the Alexa app. If you want to change the song it’s either voice command or through the Alexa, or an extra prompt through music asking for permission to play over the current song. Also Alexa is extremely forgiving to those with stutters such as myself and quiet voices. It’s a great mic which despite me stuttering or talking quietly, it still delivers exactly what I want.

Any other time ive ised it to play misic I have to yell \"Echo\" the name for it to hear me. If it could hear me better then it would get a 5 star.

Sound quality is ok, there's too much bass even after you turn it down. Its more limited as to what it can do than advertised. It's best for asking about the temp outside and playing music from Amazon Music (if you're a Prime member) but that's about it. About 50% of the time you ask it a question it says \"I don't know\" or \"I'm not sure about that.\" If you're looking for a robot like device to converse with, Alexa is not that. It's ok I guess. My kids and I we're totally bored with it around day 3 after purchase. Now, no one hardly ever uses it. I'll probably end up giving it to someone else, it's about useless to us. It still can't beat googling on your PC.

I like that it has an aux line out where you can connect another better speaker to it.\n\nIt's really cool that you can just say for example: \"Alexa: play jazz music\" and the Echo Dot will shuffle different jazz songs from the Amazon Music store. I bought this for $25, so I think it is worth that much for the voice commands, and access to tons of free music. You can automatically play any songs in your Amazon library. It has lots of other features that I haven't checked out yet. It's nice to check on the weather and movie times, etc. You can adjust the volume remotely or say \"next song\".

I can order things I frequently purchase as well as previous one-time buys so easily with Alexa. No regrets.

There are a few minor issues: 1) Streaming of radio stations or podcasts can easily drop and you need to tell Alexa to restream, 2) no built in back up power (if power goes out, the Dots are useless).

That whenever I come home and want to relax I can just give it an command by voice to play my music. It seem there no way for it to create my own personal music play list. I can not upload or add music that I already have safe on my phone or computer to make the play list. I have to use crappy 3rd party music apps or spend more money to buy songs I already have if I wanted to make my own music play list.\n\nupdate after 3 whole days since my first review of this because it has since an high star review rate I wanted to give it an chance and keep using it. Honestly I only bought it because it was on sale for 29.99 instead of the normal 50dollars and I have to say this is one of the worst 30dollars I have ever spend and I have spend my money recklessly a lot during my life. If you try to give it two commands in one sentence it will completely ignore you and not reply back at all. For example \" Alexa I do not like this song stop playing this song. \" Alexa will just ignore it and keep playing. You need to say \" Alexa I do not like this song\" than it will add to the list of song. Than after that yu have to say \" Alexa stop playing this song\" for it to stop playing the song. Another issue I have is that I can not type in the song titles that I want to listen to and have to keep saying the music title and names of the artists. Can not even type in the song title on the Alexa app on my phone that connect to the device."},{"reviewerName":"Caleb","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Cool, but there are flaws.","reviewDate":"July 29, 2019","reviewText":"This Echo is sleek and elegant, however I find that my Gen 2 dot would recognize my voice way easier.

It looks nice overall, but it is much bigger.\nSecond, the power option is only a wall outlet plug; you can no longer use a USB as an option to power the device. That stinks because I specifically put a USB wall charger in the room when I was using the 2nd gen (which now randomly has stopped connecting to the internet - but that's a different review), and now the 3rd gen hogs an outlet.\nLastly and perhaps most importantly, the sound really is horrible. Music is 'ok', but if you want to hear news or stream talk radio (or just your morning DJ - really anything with just speaking), the sound comes out muffled. It appears they've up'd the bass on the device, perhaps to enable it to have a louder max volume(?), but they have sacrificed normal speech/treble - horrible choice. I wish there was a way to adjust Tone. Thought I could live with it, now just hate it every time I turn it on, but just missed the return window. Bring back gen 2!

I own multiple Echo device including an echo, FIreTV, several dots throughout my house. They all work great except one of the new 3rd generation Dots recently purchased. That new Dot drops my music streams around 8-10 times per hour, sometimes more...sometimes every song...and has done it right from the start.\n\nSo what do I do? I go online to request an exchange for a new functional Dot. The system FORCES me to chat or speak on the phone with a customer service rep. Okay, irritating, especially when I could have simply opted to return the item for a refund, and then buying another new one to accomplish this same task. But, I'll do it.\n\nOver 2 hours later, after chatting with David through this time, I've provided lots of ridiculous info, router make and model, distance from router, other device info, etc., some of which may be relevant, but also including a DNA sample (kidding), and get this - approving his request for an Amazon rep to conduct a house visit to gather debug info from the Dot....?!?!? Seriously, for a $30 device?! I say \"sure!\" because at this point, I think they make this process as long and drawn out to dissuade people from getting this done...what else am I to think? What would you think?\n\nSo, David concludes by saying this will take several days to have the development team triage my data and get back to me via email about next steps...\n\nMeanwhile my device dropped the stream 11 times in a little over an hour while chatting with David. He wraps our chat session by asking if he has addressed all my concerns and questions. I tell him, well, \"No, not satisfactorily, but you know that don't you David?\" He responds -\"Perfect! Have a great evening.\"\n\nSo now, I'm all in to see how utterly absurd this process will be to exchange the Dot for one that functions properly. It goes without saying that I will not be recommending Echo devices to anyone and will be regaling them with the request for a home visit by Amazon before honoring the exchange request. I seriously doubt anyone, including you kind readers, will believe it! But, it's true. I swear on my dog's life.\n\nSo, what will come next?? I don't know but am waiting in awe of this stupidity and will update as it goes....\n\nUPDATE: the second Dot that came in the order with the first one is now also dropping pandora streams, so it'll be a return for both, especially since I've not received the aforementioned email from the development team wanting to swing by the house for a debug and beer session. I guess I'm done buying Echo devices until they work this out."},{"reviewerName":"Keith Carter","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Better than my old First Generation Echo","reviewDate":"July 21, 2019","reviewText":"I've have a couple of the old dots, and while they work great, the sound quality drives me up the wall.

She wouldn't understand a lot of actions I had said to her that were pretty basic.\nI had called tech support and we reset my Alexa back to factory settings TWICE and she still did the same glitch, so I received a replacement Alexa.\nOnce I got my replacement I thought for sure the issue would be resolved, but it wasn't. The same thing was happening. I thought maybe it was a system malfunction and maybe it was happening to everyone and people just knew to wait for it to be fixed.\nBut today I had switched my internet provider from Windstream to Spectrum. And suddenly SHE WORKED CORRECTLY! I'm so happy because all the functions I bought her for weren't really working correctly until today.\nSo, If you have internet speeds that are under 30mps you may not get the full alexa experience you were hoping for. I know I will defiantly be getting a second alexa now that I know why she wasn't working originally.\nShe's really helpful for someone with memory problems, especially since she's connected to your phone as well. She also helps with keeping up with our calendar because my fiance refuses to check his phone for his schedule.\nOverall Alexa has been a great addition.

The Echo Dot (3rd Gen) speaker also has distortion issues even at medium level playing its own voice. Also would be great if I could use Alexa as a bluetooth interface for my phone to call or text people just like I can do in my car. It can apparently only message or call other Alexa devices. Alexa Routines lack the capability to set timers or reminders as part of a pre-defined routine.

In addition the 3rd gen can be used with the amazon echo sub for added bass and you can pair these and use two together. Even though there are only minor differences (other then sound quality) between the 2nd gen and the 3rd the audio quality has improved so much that it is worth the upgrade.

I've always been a google home assistant person but gave this a try for Prime day, with the Philips Hue Bluetooth Color Bulbs combo. The voice recognition works well just as you'd expect from an Echo device.\nFirst of all, I had a really bad experience with the on-time delivery of this device. They cancelled my order without my consent and then tried denying me a new device. I had to call them 4 times because every time I got assertive, my call got disconnected magically. Worst customer service experience for me in probably a decade and I cannot believe how low Amazon’s customer service standards have fallen.\nAnd then the actual device’s problems. The whole - works with Philips bulbs over Bluetooth- thing, is either a scam or they just released it without testing it properly because of course, prime day sales. The device does not recognize the bulbs. Cannot connect to them. This problem persists with most people who bought the combo that amazon disabled reviews for the bulbs. I have spent north of 4 hours, tinkering with it myself and talking to customer service trying to figure out why. Both customer reps I talked to tried blaming it on my phone, that there is somehow something wrong with my Pixel 2, or the bulbs which is really low for Amazon. Only when I asked them to send that in writing in an email, they backed down from trying to blame it on my end. This is all incredibly shady.\nThey finally figured out that my firmware is not up to date but the device cannot update its firmware. It just does not update it and yes I have tried the whole mute overnight thing and it still will not update. Apparently there is no real way to force it to update. I cannot remember the last time a device gave me so many problems.\nMy advice, to those who are able to read this before this review mysteriously disappears from Amazon, is do not buy it until the general consensus that they fixed most problems. I hate that over the years I became so dependent on Amazon that I cannot really do anything about any of this, but write a bad review. I miss the company that put customer service on top of Jeff Bezos’ wallet."},{"reviewerName":"Aaron","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Top notch smart speaker for the money.

Alexa is fast and understands me perfectly and she fits nicely in with my small bedroom set-up. While Alexa with the Alexa skills app is much smarter than other voice assistants like Siri I dislike how you have to train her. For example: with my Philips hue color lights if I do not use the skills app I must say \"turn on Philips hue down light 1\". Whereas with Siri I just say \"turn on lights and bam!\". Not to mention the clunky pairing process of having to jump back and forth between apps. Again with apple and home kit I had to scan ONE qr code and it automatically found all 4 of my lights in less than a minute. Finally, I understand amazon wants you to use their prime music but I do not like the fact that I cannot use Apple Music considering many apple users like myself use this service.\n\nAll in all a good sounding speaker for 50 bucks, decent intelligence but the clunky set up with the Alexa app and the necessity of the skills app to really make Alexa smart is not very user friendly."},{"reviewerName":"Lorraine","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Works great in stereo mode!","reviewDate":"May 16, 2019","reviewText":"I have purchased five of these.

The Dot is in my bathroom and I get the news in the morning as well as listen to music while I shower.\n\nThis new Dot blows the old dot out of the water.

I decided to get a 3rd generation dot for my living room, as it would be nice to have a newer model and better speakers in a room that would get a lot of use. Unfortunately, it has not been as solid of a model as I’d hoped for, and I’ve found that it’s worse than the 2nd generation model in many regards.\n\nFirst off, the package came dented, which wasn’t a huge deal, though I wonder if that caused some of the problems. The setup process had a solid amount of errors due to already having on echo dot on my account, where it just flat out didn’t work the first day and continued to say it was not fully set up even after finishing it within the app multiple times. Once it was up, I was pretty happy with the speaker, and it can sound pretty good for such a small device.\n\nThe true problem is the microphone system. It almost never hears anyone, and you have to yell at it to get it to pick you up! Even then, it often mishears us and does something totally different than what we wanted. While it was funny the first time I was screaming “ALEXA STOP!” over it playing some music, it’s gotten a bit old now (but still kind of funny). We’ve tried putting it in different places, but no luck.\n\nIt’s a shame, because I really like the 2nd gen dot that I have, but this one just can’t compete because it can hardly hear anything. I’m hoping they improve the microphone in the future, but right now, it takes a major toll on the product."},{"reviewerName":"KayC Dior","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Very good for household use!","reviewDate":"September 18, 2019","reviewText":"I ask Alexa to do quite a few things and this speaker is very helpful.

Also the colors should be differentiated a little further because the rings that show up when something needs attention can be mistaken for another notification.

A great less expensive than a full size echo option for rooms where you have a sound system already in place. But, don’t be fooled, you can still play quality music from this if you had to, it’s just for a stand alone speaker, the full echo is better...obviously because the dot is like a quarter of the height and speaker size...but quality is great for its size.

This was a nice feature because even when the Echo Dot is obsolete, the adapter and cable will still be useful. Unfortunately on this new model, the AC to DC adapter and cable are one unit and the cable is a round connector rather than USB. Thus, it is unlikely it can be reused.

Before buying any Echo Dots, which at the time the 2nd generation was the most recent version, I had read reviews about how great the voice recognition was and how the dot would pick up the users commands even with the TV on etc. This has not been my experience, both with the 2nd gen and 3rd gen. I was hoping the 3rd gen would be better. I mainly only use Alexa for security and smart home functionality with the Ring skill and the voice recognition is my only real complaint with the product. My living room, dining room and kitchen area is a mostly open floor plan and approx. 1200 sq. ft. and I've tried all kinds of configurations with the goal being me being able to speak at my normal voice level or even slightly louder with the TV on and no matter where I am at and Alexa picking me up the first time and I have not been able to achieve this or really even close to it. Sometimes I have to almost yell. I have the dots plugged directly into outlets using 3rd party holders as I'm a minimalist and like to keep the clutter to a minimum. I have 4, all 3rd gen, and they are spaced pretty evenly apart. I don't have the TV off very much when I'm at home but I believe voice recognition is not an issue when its turned off even if i dropped it down to only 1 or 2 dots."},{"reviewerName":"Kym Kamra","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Setting this up to pair with your Echo is a freaking nightmare.

I used to work for Apple Retail and have used the HomePod and Apple Music extensively. I got the Echo Dot for free with the purchase of a Ring Doorbell.\n\nAlexa is doing great! She picks up what I’m saying quickly and responds aptly. I haven’t even called her bad names yet, as Siri has taken a tongue lashing from me. In the same breath, she responds more quickly and more thoroughly because she is remembering all my conversations, and as we have recently learned, these conversations are being sent out to be listened to. Siri does not remember prior conversations for privacy reasons, which is a higher moral standard, but less effective in the short term.\n\nBut that’s okay, because you can turn off the settings that allows Alexa to send your audio out to be listened to.\n\nAmazon Music is okay, but the library is nowhere near as large as Apple Music and couldn’t play some of my favorite albums.\n\nBut that’s okay, as I was able to easily set up my Apple Music account through the Alexa app and now I just tell Alexa to tell Siri to play my Apple Music. Alexa has an assistant, and her name is Siri.\n\nThe bass is almost nonexistent in this little Dot, with a lot of low-mid trying to cover it, which is does an alright job of. The mids and highs are nice.\n\nBut that’s okay, because it has a headphone jack and I just plugged it into my existing stereo.\n\nI haven’t tried any of the higher functions yet, but right out of the box and the first week have been impressive.\n\nThings are best when they are free."},{"reviewerName":"Tai Chi","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Dotty Over It","reviewDate":"November 30, 2018","reviewText":"I got my youngest kid a second generation one.

Just say \"Alexa add milk to the shopping list.\" She will even remind you if you added an item twice so it won't be duplicated. Great sound.

(Besides the occasional miscommunication between you and your Alexa usually from mumbling or faulted pronunciation) From as simple yet convenient as a Bluetooth speaker with Apple login for any room, all the way to making calls/play games and trivia/turning on lights/locking doors/ closing blinds/ controlling outlets/ etc. The convenience is all too good to pass up! I bought 2 of the Echo Dots (3rd gen) the first week the 3rd gens were released. One for me and one for my mother. And she absolutely loves it! It’s an everyday used product for sheer convenience with anyone I’ve ever known who owns an Alexa device. Definitely worth the purchase in my eyes!\nWith that said, it’s bug fixes don’t come as often as a tech-y kind of person like I would like BUT they hardly run into any problems as far as I can tell from all of the Alexa devices I’ve had. Like I said, miscommunication is number one problem as of now which hopefully will be managed someway/somehow. But as of now, just speak clearly haha. I have yet to experience any bad connections with any of my lights, outlets, or other Alexa devices with my Echo personally so I’d assume any review saying there are disconnection errors with external add-on devices would be because of either their poorly constructed third-party device or poor internet connection. Either way, I believe only what I see with my own eyes and what I see and perceive from my experience so far is a well executed and designed Amazon device.\nFor the great price they run it at, it really is worth the try!"},{"reviewerName":"WaynieBob","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Very satisified.","reviewDate":"August 17, 2019","reviewText":"The Echo dot is well worth the money.

The last version looked much more like a toy and not a home appliance. The sound quality is also massively improved. Lows are many times more pronounced and the mid range is solid. It's still missing something on the high end, and it sounds a bit muddy as a result, but this version has reached the point of a decent home speaker that I'd feel comfortable using by itself. The external 3.5 mm jack is still there however, which I appreciate. I'd definitely recommend upgrading to the third generation echo dot, and don't forget to take advantage of amazon's trade-in program if you own the previous model."},{"reviewerName":"aliceshepz","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Useless","reviewDate":"September 26, 2019","reviewText":"Maybe it's me but nowhere in the description did I see it say that this device REQUIRES wi-fi.

I also have some light switches that are WiFi controlled as well as a speaker. So now I can control lights, music and speaker. If you don’t already have those kinds of things I don’t know whether I’d recommend it. However, we are really having fun asking questions. We get immediate answers. Kind of amazing. You can ask the weather (for anywhere) the time, the date, trivia questions. We were watching a playoff football game and they had a rules expert explaining a ruling. I thought who’s this guy? I asked Alexa and she immediately told us his credentials and I found he was more than qualified to explain the rules. I had never heard of the guy. You can ask for famous people ages. You can simply ask for a timer. Say you’re cooking, you can say set a timer for 30 minutes. In 30 minutes she sets off an alarm. You can say play some music for 10 minutes. You get music for 10 minutes. I’m not saying everyone needs this. But I’m really happy I have one.

I should mention that I got Alexa bundled with a smart plug (highly recommend doing so) Aside from allowing you to blast your music, Alexa also allows you to be ten times more laid back than usual. I have some string lights that I use during the night and having to get up, just to turn them off is not the move, but with Alexa on hand that process is so much easier. With just one quick blurb, I can stay in bed and drift off to sleep. I've only had my Alexa for about a week at this point but if you're looking for a speaker that can help you out a bit, I highly suggest placing an order. To close this review, I'd like to mention that if you do go out and buy an Alexa, she is very responsive to her name.

I paired two Bluetooth speakers to the echo dot in one room, and am using the echo dot as the only speaker in the other. I’ve been able to add a Bluetooth transmitter via the aux jack on one of the echos and from their paired two speakers in stereo mode. This was/is a bit buggy but generally easy to get working properly. I was also able to create an “everywhere” group to command multi room streaming from any room using either echo dot or the echo. It works fairly well, with minor syncing issues between the room. Also, multi room eliminates the blue tooth connection between the echo and the Bose Wave system, and the sound in that room comes directly from the echo. I think the multi room and stereo pairing are great features and will improve over time.

Other than that, it's a handy and inexpensive little tool that I'd recommend for any and every household."},{"reviewerName":"Bodie","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"It’s a fun item","reviewDate":"August 18, 2019","reviewText":"This is my first experience with an echo type device and I like it. I’m not so tech savvy that I can automate my entire home, but Alexa has her value. She is a great quick source of information like the weather, which NFL teams are playing, what certain terms mean, and so forth. Alexa also has a bit of humor in her AI whining find refreshing.

I admit freely that I got a Google Home Mini, to see what it was like, and I enjoyed the freedom to speak to a working assistant without having to press a button, but while we're not unGoogly by any means, we're a little less integrated than some others. We primarily use our iCloud calendars, primarily shop at Amazon, etc. So it was with great excitement that, this year, I ordered myself an Echo Dot. The \"try Amazon Music and get a Dot for cheap\" promo was very convincing. But I turned right around and bought another on discount a few days later. Anyway, the first thing I noticed was the sound quality. I'd just tested an Echo 2nd Gen for my wife. Its sound was impressive, especially with such a small device. I was expecting ... let's say a little less out of the Dot. While its volume isn't quite what the Echo's is, its sound quality is actually as, or nearly as, good. The Dot pleasantly filled my living room with Christmas music, despite its small size. And by comparison, the Google Home Mini I'd bought previously sounded just as good at low volumes, but the Dot kept its sound quality even at maximum volume. Granted, Christmas music rarely clips or distorts anyway, because Christmas metal isn't tremendously popular on the radio stations I chose. Also, Alexa works nearly flalessly, even when the music is playing pretty loudly, unlike the Home Mini. I grant you that a more realistic comparison would be a Home Mini to a 2nd Gen Dot, but I bought the 3rd Gen, so I can only tell about what I have. Alexa has always been fun, but using her hands free is truly awesome. If I have one complaint, it's that Alexa is great, but I miss the variety of voices available from Google. And Amazon is the kind of company with the kind of design forethought to create different assistants with different personality and even different looks to sell to a variety of crowds. Alexa is a single, well-recognized actor in the Personal Digital Assistant space, but Amazon can do more. But that's a hypothetical gripe and has been brought up before. As it stands, the Echo Dot surpassed my expectations, transporting me simultaneously back to the first time I heard \"Computer\" in Star Trek and forward to the time that this tech becomes truly ubiquitous. Congrats, Amazon."},{"reviewerName":"Seaotter","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Better!","reviewDate":"February 2, 2019","reviewText":"Update June 15 2016:\nStill working great.

My old one never had a problem hearing me. This one requires me to be right next to it when the music is playing and I want to interrupt. My old one kept better track of the songs I \"liked.\" I have \"liked\" a song and had it added to my list and then during the same listening session I have \"liked\" the song again and it does not always tell me that similar feedback has already been saved. And there seems to be only one response when I say I like a song. The old one would say, \"Got it\", or \"That will help me play more of the good stuff.\" It did not cut off songs before the end of the song was finished playing, bit this one frequently does. And it stops playing altogether sometimes even though I didn't ask it to. And I do not remember hearing, \"Hmm, I'm not sure\" as much as I do now. I have enjoyed asking for certain kinds of music or particular songs, but I am disappointed at how specific I must be.

However I cannot use the demand features of these services only live streams. The integration by Bluetooth with my phone is especially wonky. it often requires me to reboot my phone in order to connect. There is no easy way to understand the features of these devices so it is a hit-or-miss process setting things to work with them and requires ridiculous amounts of time and effort.

Okay I know it sounds a bit lazy, but when your hands are full like say eating while watching TV, it is great. I can control most of my home with my voice. Maybe lazy, but I say efficient. You can also turn your lights on from anywhere else while on vacation to make the appearance that your home for security. There is also an app that plays iheart radio while I'm gone and keeps background noise for my dog. If I had to pick something to complain about, I wish you could pick your own wake word or she knew you were talking about her as opposed to her. Tiffany Hadish made her play Janet Jackson on Nobody's Fool, which was kinda funny the first time, but I could see it getting old hat. You'll also notice your eyes will glance across the room seeing if she lights up to unwantingly take part in your conversation, when you say her name casually like you accidently said the name of the person your gossiping about and they might be in earshot and heard you. But she's fun to have around the house. Timers are a lifesaver as well as even asking her the time. Games like SongQuiz are awesome that's has all generations of my family playing along, family game night is back and you don't have to clean up thimbles and fake money when it's over.

Echo Dot, I can tell you that Gen. 3 is the one you want if you don't use an external speaker system. The sound is much sharper and cleaner than previous versions and even music sounds better on it. What I like about the Echo Dot is that you can pair it with another Dot to play music in stereo without the use of Bluetooth or directly connected speakers.

They have so many functions for our family. We use them primarily for music, alarms, timers, lists & intercom. A few things we often ask it about the weather, what time it is, how to spell things, etc. The voice recognition has definitely become better too as the speaker for listening to music.

Both work exactly the same way. Sound quality is good. I adjust bass/treble to suit my preference. There are endless skills to learn, so you can do as much or little as you want. They need to improve the Alexa learning so she can answer more questions. I ask for the current outside \"dew point\" and get a definition of dew point. Not what I wanted. She does understand humidity, so I get that reading. I don't have any switches or outlet connected yet, so can't speak to that.\nI do like the feature that Alexa can listen for smoke and CO alarms while I'm out, and message my phone about it."},{"reviewerName":"Matt","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"a MUST have!","reviewDate":"December 28, 2018","reviewText":"Before this recent holiday, i've seen alexas on TV, seen them on advertisements, never really thought about how much they can really do.

It connected to the bulbs without having to link any accounts or anything which is a big plus. I have \"routines\" setup with Alexa to turn on our lights, or turn them off when we go to sleep.

I use the sleep app for rain sound every night and it still gets confused most of the time or will play the same one, even tho I’ve added most of them for rain. I also don’t like how the app pages default back to the top of the list after I enable something within the list of choices. I gave a 2 rating because so far I see nothing special about it, mainly because she answers with “idk” to most questions. Nor do I like how I have to remember the exact way to ask for what I’ve enabled. It seems to resort to playing a song from your music playlist based on one word it understands. Yet it doesn’t give a reassurance question, it just blast the song on. Ugh\nWhat I like a lot is how the smart plug enables turning on lights. That’s pretty cool 😎. Problem is, you’ll find yourself walking right pass the light just to ask Alexa to do it. 😂🙃🤫\nThe Alexa site is confusing and boring. It doesn’t flow like other programs. It simply drops everything in one place in each category, and you just figure it out. It listed some books I’ve purchased in the past, and although Alexa can read them, her voice is very much monotone robot so the “umph” from your story is missed.

After speaking with someone who instructed how to perform and update on the device as it is several versions old it did not work. I spoke to another rep this morning who insists that it is my WiFi and completely ignored the software level even after being told several times. The product is in a business with top of the line WiFi which supports 5 vehicle scan tool devices with no problems. Finally she instructed me to ask ALEXA to update software which i cant do because that function is not available with the current software level. So frustrated and not even worth it since it was free. This thing is going in the trash and I will be returning my daughters Fire tablet given the poor customer service."},{"reviewerName":"Norm Sanders","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Much more accurate & intuitive than anticipated!","reviewDate":"November 9, 2019","reviewText":"Having been used to Google's Mini, it's taken us a bit to adjust to Alexa/Echo Dot, but not long, and we've been incredibly impressed.

She has very low vision (macular degeneration for 10 years) and a little dementia. Although she first resisted this “robot” in her apartment, she has embraced it a short 2 weeks or so later. Alexa now responds to mom’s “thank you, Alexa” with appropriate comments, such as: you’re welcome, or glad to help, etc. Alexa LEARNED to do this!! There has been a learning curve, and Alexa speaks way too fast (as noted in many comments) which has been changed (8/6 or 7/2019, thanks for listening, amazon). Especially too fast for older ears. It appears you MAY have to tell her to speed up or slow down for each time she talks. Also , it APPEARS I cannot do this on the app as a “setting.” THIS NEEDS TO BE AN ACROSS THE BOARD adjustment (not time to time) AND it Must be Adjustable from the APP. MY reason for 4 stars on sound quality is due to these comments. The actual quality of the sound seems fine. Not 100%, but fine. Bottom line: Alexa has SAVED MY LIFE and GREATLY ENHANCED my mom’s quality of life. I’ve just bought Echo Connect.

Additionally, sometimes the device will become unresponsive at random times. I can't yet identify what it is that triggers this unresponsiveness.

Alexa works well, I wish there was an easier way to learn how to use this device other than emails. I enjoy using it as a wireless speaker at home, it works especially well as a sound machine, I keep mine by my bed and use it to help sleep. The reason I give two stars and not five is because there's no battery, and this device MUST be plugged in in order to operate, the included cable is incredibly short, and I haven't figured out if there's a voice command to tell Alexa not to listen to you (as if you were to press the mute button and the red ring appears). Also, a side note, wouldn't it be cool if this device doubled as a wireless charger? This in my opinion would have offset the fact that it does not have a battery. Or at least a couple USB type A power out ports. Some sort of charging capabilities would be very nice, considering you cant take this device anywhere outside the home. It would also be great if there was a button command you could press on the speaker to enter Bluetooth pairing mode, instead you have to use the app/website which in my opinion is cumbersome.

I had ordered a smart plug with it so I can control my Christmas tree lights, I just tell Alexa to turn them off and on, no more plugging and unplugging. My daughter loves that if I run to the grocery store she can call me using the Echo Dot, this feature alone is worth the cost for kids to connect with family without tying up their parents phone, for my children the call quality is much better than them fidgeting with a cell phone using speaker phone. Between festive music while cooking or kids having dance parties, we all are enjoying the convenience of Alexa with this Echo Dot.

Not the smartest","reviewDate":"December 12, 2018","reviewText":"Own a few Google Home Speakers and I feel that Echo 3rd generation speakers sound better than home mini. The home mini was better than the 2nd generation echo though. Ok now the bad part. Echo is not as smart as Home mini when it comes to responding to basic questions like singing some nursery rhymes for my baby. One thing that I don’t like is it doesn’t have a physical stop button like the google mini has; you can just tap on it and it will stop.

I had to install the app on my phone for set up and use the manual connect using my phone's WiFi connection.

Alexa is 10 times more accurate than Siri, when you ask a question she’ll give you a direct answer or response, she’ll play almost 98% of the songs you tell her to and uses a variety of music resources from pandora to Apple Music to Spotify. Unlike Siri she instantly plays any song on command. My most favorite thing is the smart home voice commands! Turning on lights and appliances through voice command is incredible and I have recommended and bought almost all my family members echos and smart home devices from lights to plugs.

The Trivia games are pretty enjoyable. However, I am somewhat disappointed. Even after going through the steps to eliminate it, alexa seems to struggle to understand me sometimes. I will command Alexa to turn on a music channel and when she can’t seem to figure it out i just give up and have the google home mini play it instead. The mini understands the same command that the dot does not. I would bet that the echo dot can get louder than my google mini but i don’t know because the volume never needs to be loud. Especially living in a townhome with a shared wall. the quality of the sound is poor at the low level we use it on. I feel like the bass needs to be turned down and the treble needs to be up at that low level because it’s not clear. For that reason I struggle to understand it as well.

However, when I ask it to play something (I listened to an entire Thievery Corporation album) it does not sound bad, and I actually enjoy it. I would never have asked Alexa to play music on the second generation, unless it was a purely vocal track, and even then I would not have liked the tinniness of the second generation.\n\nI bought the third gen while it was on discounted price, otherwise I think I would have been satisfied with one Echo Dot.

I love the fact that she is always learning and expanding her capabilities to enhance my experience. That is why I did not hesitate to purchase this 3rd gen Echo dot for my bedroom. I use it to control my lights, play music and even set a sleep timer to play nature sounds to help me fall asleep at night. It was very easy to install, being pretty much plug and play, and once connected to my WiFi router, all was up and running smoothly!

For example, I connect it to my Beats Pill (a wireless speaker) so that I can have music on my patio.\n\nIt has privacy settings that are supposed to maintain your privacy (so no one, including Amazon, can hack in and listen to what is going on in your house.

Many times I will set a timer in one room and don’t want to miss it because I have moved to a different room. More importantly I don’t want a timer to go off and have to run to another room in order to turn it off.

I've hooked this up to my Pandora account and also asked it to play other sounds for me to leave on for my cat while out of the house.\n\nFor those times where I just want to listen to music, this is so much more energy-efficient than turning on my TV and DVD player just to hear my favorite Pandora stations."},{"reviewerName":"Rick","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"I have tried numerous Echo devises and none have worked well.","reviewDate":"August 20, 2019","reviewText":"This was my last ditch effort trying Echo devices.

She's keeping track of my grocery list, and with the Alexa app on my phone, I don't have to write anything down - my grocery list shows up on my phone at the grocery store. I've had her remind me of things on my To-Do list, and set an alarm to wake me up. I've enabled some of her skills so that I can get News Flashes, learn about geology and even Spanish. I was able to pair the Echo Dot with my BoomBot speaker so that I can walk around the house and even go outside and listen to as much music as I want. I can ask her to Pause the music so that I can ask her a question, and then have her continue to play the music that I was listening to - she picks up right where the song left off.

The one issue I have with it is unless you are a techy person you may never use it to its full potential because you may never really pick up on just how the \"Skills\" as Amazon calls them work. Basically you have to download an Alexa app on your phone and then setup the device but from there you have to download skills to really take advantage of this device, an example would be I downloaded a Fios Skill so that I am able to control my cable box with commands such as \"Alexa watch AMC on Fios\" The problem is setting up the skills for this to work I had to enable the Fios TV skill then I had to choose what cable box this device was going to control, well if you never named your cable boxes by the rooms they are in then you have to figure out the name the cable company gave your cable box. Anyways like I said once you get everything figured out its great. I have it tied to my calendar in Outlook, my cable box, my Fire TV, I use it to play music from Amazon \"Apple Music is coming to this device soon\" I ask it what my commute to work is like, what's the Weather today.

Note if you down load Alexa on computer or phone same problem it will not give you access to cameras or sound directing you must purchase their other devices what a waste."},{"reviewerName":"Betina","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Awesome very helpful give it a day or so to get used to I got a little","reviewDate":"January 26, 2019","reviewText":"In love like really, only things I’d change is I’d love a guys voice like, hrmmm Brad Pitt or someone or even Better one of the first James Bond’s :-) also when I ask Alexa to read one of her stories they are about 2 minutes long and good so wish they would be longer.\nI have audiable so yes I can get some from there.

We set it up in our bedroom on one of the nightstands. I would ask Alexa to play music/the weather/insert command here and nothing. I had to repeat myself over and over to get it to do anything and even more so when it was playing music. The TV wasn't on and no one else was making noise so it definitely wasn't background noise affecting it's hearing capabilities. Not happy with this at all and returning it."},{"reviewerName":"George W","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Incredible technology.

We got this device not knowing all of the things it could do. At the time my husband and I just wanted it for the storytime, games, and music features. I love the sound that comes out of the speaker when we play music. I can set a reoccurring bedtime timer and my boys know when they here it that means it is bedtime. Our 3 year old son hates to get up in the morning. Now he can't wait because he knows he gets to ask the echo to play baby shark. This makes starting the day easier for us. We have found that we are laughing and spending more time as a family with this device. It is fun not listening to commercials. Now a days the commercials are so long on the radio that by the time they are done, so is my 3 year old. We are able to shuffle songs that my 3 year old, 10 year old, and we like to hear. Dancing in the house and doing chores with my boys, we can play games and get work done. It has helped my 10 year old with his spelling. We do not use this device all the time, but Alexa is great at activities that don't stop you from spending time with your family. We will be using the Santa tracking Skill this year and we are so excited to see how it will go over with our 3 year old. There is also a skill that you can call Santa and \"leave a message\" to add to your Christmas list. I don't think we are ready for that one this year, but maybe next year.

To compare the two echos:\n\nPros:\n-This one is loud. A lot louder. I turn it down about halfway.\n-Most music sounds way better. It's better than most generic Bluetooth speakers. It's also louder.\n- it just looks cooler.\n\nCons:\n-The sound is muffled. Alexas voice is harder to understand.\n- It lost the super convenient USB power port.\n- I noticed that the mic doesn't sound as good. When I drop in or leave messages, it sounds a lot quieter than it does from my second generation.\n- the light bar is dimmer. This isn't awful, I just like the feedback without having to look directly at the dot. This is probably a pro to most.\n\nIt really is a small difference and it's not that the 3rd Generation dot is bad, I just think the 2nd generation is better for the price.

However, setting up things on the echo was a little confusing at first. I still need to earn the commands. I mainly got it so i can use it for my spotify playlists. It worked great the first night when i set it up, but the day after, I asked alexa to play my playlist and it kept giving me nursery rhymes from amazon music lol. It was quite frustrating. So i went into the settings and realized that somehow my main music was set as \"amazon music\"-(which i dont even have) instead of spotify. Once i switched spotify to my main music, it worked again. So hopefully it doesn't happen again. I will write an updated review once I learn more :)"},{"reviewerName":"Kendall","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"What I hate most about my Alexa!","reviewDate":"April 27, 2019","reviewText":"The thing I hate most about my Alexa is that when I asked her to change to a British accent she told me she couldn’t do it. And then I thought to myself this is ridiculous. Every piece of technology I own talks to me in an accident my GPS talks to me in an accent my Siri on my iPhone talks to me in an accent. Not because I have an accent not because I live in a different country but because I just love hearing other people talk to me in an accent it just makes me happy. So in the future with future updates Alexa should take this into consideration I would like her to talk to me in an accent for example British! Other than that I appreciate everything she does for me she reminds me of everything I need to do creates my to do list am I shopping list which is amazing. The other thing I hate about her is that she does not do monthly reminders so my credit card bill that is due monthly she does not remind me of which is kind of frustrating so you can remind me at the same time every single day to do something but God for bid you remind me at the same time every month to do something, how does that make sense?

The Sandstone color is my preference, but the Charcoal and Heather Gray look nice too. Alexa is as helpful as on the second generation, so if you already have a Gen 2 echo Dot and have it connected to a good sound system, there's no reason to upgrade.

Very convenient when working in the office. Haven't perfected using it, like raising and lowering volume. Seems like you have to say the command \"Alexa, lower\" to go down in volume in increments, but I may be wrong and a rookie so not familiar. Also, we thought it would be wireless, because I believe the tall version is. If I had known that, I may have considered buying the wireless one, because who wants more cords in an office? Not I. Another downfall is that you can't tell Alexa to play apple music. You stream it, just like a regular bluetooth speaker, but you are able to use commands when playing the apple music. Also, works with Pandora, so I've been using that more. Overall, great, but could be better if it was wireless and compatible with Apple Music."},{"reviewerName":"Charles Seielstad","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Echo Dot Smart Speaker Is Great","reviewDate":"May 30, 2019","reviewText":"I was really surprised how easy it was to install with my current Amazon/Fire TV/Ring Setup\nI installed it to use with my Ring Doorbell 2 as an extra doorbell notification in my office at home.

The information she gives when asked a question is short but good, it gets to the point of what you asked and cuts out all the extra stuff that isn’t of any importance to your question. Definitely better than Siri and most smart AI assistants, she can hear my voice over other sounds which makes talking to her in a crowded or loud house very useful and overall she meets all my expectations. The only thing I do wish is that you have more control of her over the app, for example instead of asking her to change the volume or going up to her why don’t we intergrate a control panel in the app that lets you adjust volumes to your liking, let’s you change the language she speaks or understands, changes the color of her circle light maybe from blue to pink or red or even cycle through a bunch of colors, have a mute botton on the app so that you don’t have to walk up to her and press the botton. There’s a lot of potential in the app that deserve to go with our smart buddy, it’s wonderful what we can do with our voices but if she had a control panel on the app it would make her better than any other smart speaker out there guaranteed."},{"reviewerName":"Eloise","rating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"The sound wasn't great and I don't like having my privacy compromised.","reviewDate":"July 18, 2019","reviewText":"I had the Echo Dot for around 10 days.

The third in the bedroom now has replaced my clock radio. I have alarms set with \"Reville\", \"The National Anthem\" and the \"Marine Corps Hymn\". That's enough to wake me and get me going. Sadly, I can't find one sound, a US Navy's ship with \"This is a drill, this is a drill. General Quarters, General Quarters. (Then the klaxon alarm)\" Experience from nearly 50 years ago would really wake me up. I ask for any type of music genre at night and it is restful. My only problem would be if I don't ask the question or command in the proper manner, it will come back with \"I don't understand\" or \"I can't do that\" or \"Sorry, I'm not sure about that\" or something like that. For instance, I just asked what time an English soccer game plays on Saturday. Alexa couldn't respond with an answer.

They are both paired with a HK Onyx 2 speaker. The Gen 3 dot needs to me set at more than twice the volume as the Gen 1 or my Gen 2 dots. Glad Amazon is selling these cheap.

The previous Dot was great, but the speaker was just barely functional - for music, it was better than nothing, but nearly anything else was better in turn. The new Dot is a massive improvement in sound quality - there's more extension on the high and low ends, and there's a warmth and depth that was completely lacking before. It's still limited by it's size, but it sounds much more like to the full-size Echo than it does the previous Dot. Despite losing a few microphones, it hears at least as well as the previous generation. With a soft fabric covering, the new Dot feels much more at home in, well, a home. It's a bit bigger than the old version and now requires a custom power adapter, but apart from that, it's an improvement in every way."},{"reviewerName":"Mc","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Doesn't work","reviewDate":"October 31, 2018","reviewText":"Mine doesn't do anything I ask it to do.

Some of the commands have to phrased in a certain way in order for Alexa to understand. It will come with time, I hope. Also there are certain apps or podcast I have trouble connecting to the Echo Dot. And if I have my bluetooth “ON” in my iPhone, it will disconnect any other Bluetooth device you may be using. This is annoying because it will keep doing it until you completely shut off the connection from the Echo. Other than that, in time I will get to know the commands and what Alexa understands. That is why I gave it 4 stars.

Sounds amazing with all genres of music and very helpful with the alarms and reminders and news reports."},{"reviewerName":"Mike","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Its ok","reviewDate":"October 31, 2019","reviewText":"Overall its an somewhat of ok smart assistant. Issues: Integrating it with another amazon speaker is not easy/its pretty bad because it would either not play in sequence with another speaker or even worse is when you would ask for a song to be played on one speaker in kitchen for ex and it would play in a living room while kitchen one will be silent. Dont really know why it does that. Speaker vise its pretty weak but its tiny and packs fee features so expected. Another issue is phone connectivity. It would connect to the phone play music for like 4 mins and just silent itself. No matter what you do it wont play anything until you disconnect the phone 🤷🏼‍♂️ Rest of the features its ok. also when it does connect only one speaker will play off the phone which is annoying. Alexa needs to become a little smarter with answers too. Rest of the features its fine."},{"reviewerName":"Dave","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Not recommended by me","reviewDate":"December 4, 2018","reviewText":"Had a tough time getting it hook up to my pixel 3, never did get it to work right.

Three stars only cause I don't really have any use for it and a few small blocks...\n\nFirst, in the month I've had mine, I've asked what the weather is maybe 10 times and when it decides to work, would turn my Xbox One on/off.\n\nAlso, cant play my own music through speaker... Huge downside, you can only use things like Amazon music or Spotify or something. I actually like owning my music and don't want to pay for a music service to stream music while also taking internet bandwidth from other things in the house. I don't need to call out specific artist/bands either, just being able to call out play/pause/shuffle would be great for my own music playing.\n\nI would have returned mine, but apparently it only has a one month return window and it is literally the day after...

So I was out of warranty by the time I got around to calling tech support but to their credit they did try to help with over over an hour of trying everyone had already tried to reset the darn thing.

They were transfixed by the joke function which has been pretty hilarious to watch.\n- It does a surprisingly good job finding songs if you know the artist and song name though performance I find so far is significantly worse for song title alone.\n- I actually was trying to talk to it within 10 minutes of setting up. It is very good at encouraging a conversational approach. I do a lot of dictation and I struggle with dragon not understanding me as wel as I would like but alexa does well for single commands\n- a Con is the initial fun of conversation grinds to a halt after about the 2nd step of the conversation. Alexa for me thus far really just does 1-2 step interactions and nothing more complex.\n- Overall very happy with purchase. Very interesting gadget.

Only one Spotify account user will program at a time and if we want to play the same music on two or three we can not do that. You have to move the music from unit to unit verbally if you want it in the room your in. If the registered user leaves the house, then the music goes to bluetooth in the car and leaves the ones at home unusable for music. So perfect for prime users that like amazon music. Speakers quality is good. The lights have to take up a Ethernet port on the router. That would be fine if all the teens didn’t think they needed to be hard wired in for faster gaming speeds.

I like the looks of the 3rd gen. My other dot is 2nd gen. I went on line to see what it can do and there are numerous \"skills\" that you can chose . Which leads me to my only complaint. There may be an answer and I don't know. So what frustrates me is in \"my skill\" I have to scroll through to find them. I would like an easier and faster format. Like alphabetical that I can click on or similar to my phone list. It has a lot of cool things it can do, but if it takes too long to find them or I forget what I have then I won't use them and Dot does very little but answers an occasional question."},{"reviewerName":"Eva Armes","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"go ahead and buy it!!","reviewDate":"July 24, 2019","reviewText":"This Echo Dot is probably the best thing I've ever bought from Amazon!

I have synchronized all my playlist from \"everywhere\" and am able to play any song from the whole Amazon Library. It's awesome, and I will probably buy another one for the bedroom soon.

The thing i dont like most is you have to say things exactly right or she doesnt know ehat your wanting. Example if you want her to stop playing a sound you say alexa stop playing that sound or song.

Setup was painless and although Alexa was a little too eager at first, she's quickly adjusted to the level of ambient noise going on in the room the Dot is in. After having the Dot for a couple months, she no longer randomly responds to sounds coming from the TV or people talking in the room and is very good at identifying when someone is addressing her specifically. The sound quality is average but the speaker can actually achieve some pretty surprising levels of volume considering its size which is a huge plus for me as I primarily wanted it as a \"smarter\" alarm clock. Its small form factor and low price is a great entry point for anyone who would like to add Alexa capabilities to their home (the options really start to expand out from there, she's very talented!)."},{"reviewerName":"caswan","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Love Alexa!!!!","reviewDate":"September 19, 2019","reviewText":"I love Alexa for so many things!

Now after using it for just over 2 weeks I can honestly say that I haven't been disappointed.\n\nPros:\nThe build quality gives me the impression that I paid much more for it than I did.\nThe built-in mics work well from across the room when I'm using Alexa, even when there is some background noise.\nAs far as audio quality, I have found it to be great for audio books when it comes to vocal clarity.\nSongs sound good when in a quite environment where you can stay around 50% volume.\n\nCons:\nThe speaker isn't the best when it comes to lower end sounds in songs at full volume (I was expecting this give the size and specs) so I wouldn't buy this if you are looking for a small form factor speaker with lots of bass. If you are looking for that I would recommend an Echo Plus.

I took that one to work and installed this one at home. Even though I purchased this at Christmas time, it has had very little use. I then began requesting Alexa to play music and the distortion shocked me.. It is so bad that I've thought of throwing it out and bringing my old one home. Complete garbage! Makes Joni Mitchell sound like Marilyn Manson!!\n\nMind you I am not playing it beyond its obvious capabilities like a 14 year old would at high volume. Nor am I playing head banger songs with huge bass. Simply background music while I cook or entertain.\n\nSo It now sits there and is used only for weather, traffic and for some questions and answers.\nLoved my 1st Gen and thought this new one would be an improvement!\n\nPerhaps this is a lemon?

We are in our 70's and are barely tech-wise, so we figured we would need our kids' help in setting it up. We were wrong! The tutorials provided moved us easily through the set up. Amazon provides continuing updates to help us learn more about what Alexa can do. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is the sound quality.

I would probably never have purchased one for myself. It was set up by the person who gave it to me so I didn't get to choose any of the options. I used it for maybe one hour - then it went back in the box where it will probably stay until I can sell or otherwise get rid of it without offending the gift giver.\n\nShortly after setting it up, I started receiving Alexa and smart device email offers which I didn't ask for or want. It records every command or request it receives and deleting those is not any easy process. There are probably those who don't mind sacrificing their privacy for convenience but to me, it is mostly a privacy invading novelty item."},{"reviewerName":"GhostFace","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Love it but the speaker has issues","reviewDate":"December 7, 2018","reviewText":"UPDATE:\nEver since I restarted the unit about a month or two ago I have not had the same problem.

While I haven't tried out the smart bulbs, I've asked Alexa a variety of questions about weather, current events, movies, astrophysics and theory. I can tell she pulls most of her information from either Google or Wikipedia. While on Christmas vacation, I'm trying to stay away from sitting at a desk so she's great for quick inquiries. The other day I heard my boyfriend answering political questions that Alexa was asking HIM in the form of some quiz with multiple rounds. I believe the dog thinks we're changing her name to \"Alexa\" as she trots over when we call for the Echo across the room. It has a great range as I can ask for her while I'm in the kitchen and the Echo Gen 3 is way on the other side of the house in the living room. Overall I'm happy with this purchase!

Only when you are standing directly over the mics will it pick up clear statement. This is a somewhat large flaw... but I think the stand you can buy on Amazon might be a suitable answer for this. Since it seems to work when speaking directly into the mics with no issue, the stand should help reorient the mics so they are facing toward you. After that I can't foresee any issue.

We often have to repeat ourselves a few times to turn it down or off. Consequently we've quickly developed a rather stern tone when addressing it: \"Alexa!\"\nVery occasionally it hallucinates its name when we're merely conversing. Its resulting response is a bit creepy but amusing.\nIt's interesting how we relate to it.

Sometimes her processes go from one point to the other, example one day I asked what happened in today’s history and got a full lecture of history event which was what I want The next day when I went to show off with Alexa it would not work.

This is the Amazon Echo Dot 3rd Gen. It looks so much better than last year's echo, and it sounds even better, too. The design is similar to the Google Home Mini, it's covered in cloth and it's a little chunkier than the previous echo dots. I bought a speaker system to go with it, and it works really well. Alexa is still inferior to Google Assistant, but she is still super helpful."},{"reviewerName":"M. L.

I was hesitant to order the sand color, but it was all that was available. It's a very neutral color and works fine with my decor. Since I already have an echo dot this was immediate set up as it synced with my other one. Echo Dots are easy to set up regardless. My second one will be upstairs and I'm having Alexa turn on my bedroom lights with the special plugs ordered.

I keep this one in my bedroom and added a Smart Plug to turn on/off the lamp next to my bed. I also use it for ambient sounds (numerous selections such as distant thunderstorm, rain forest, ocean waves, etc.) at night for falling asleep. I have set up a 'routine' (very easy to do) and when I say \"Alexa, good morning\" the response is the weather forecast for the day. It's fun to have for silly moments such as asking it to bark like a dog (my cat's reaction was hilarious!) or playing music. Since I live alone, I feel secure knowing if there was an emergency I could easily ask Alexa to dial 911 hands free (I have not needed this, thankfully). I plan to add devices such as my thermostat in the near future.

I bought this one to replace an older generation one that would reset itself several times a day, which i simply threw in the trash out of frustration. This new one changed to a proprietary charger, so you cannot use it with a standard micro USB, and the plug in takes up about as much power strip space as an entire deck of cards, if said deck of cards had the prongs coming out of it the very worst way possible.

Not because it isn't a good product, simply because I think it can be a bit misleading for those who just want a bluetooth speaker with good sound quality that they can connect, wherever they are (regardless if there is WiFi or not) and play music straight from their phone without Alexa prompting them to update her software even though when you ask her, she tells you her software is already up to date - so you then try and play music from Apple Music and she again prompts you to update her software.

Despite that minor issue, the 3rd gen is much better sound quality than the 2nd gen (I knew this dot was going into my kitchen, where I don't have a sound system.

Dazed and confused and start preparing myself to get ready for a long dread day of work when I noticed my phone depicting I was up 2.5 hrs early. So I check my Alexa app if my alarm was still on for 6am, which it was. So I promptly went back to sleep and too my shock my 6 am alarm did not go off.

So I decided I would get the Echo Dot just to control my home alarm. I love this thing. It does SOOOOO much more than Home pod. Home Pod sounds way better, but that's a given since the Echo Dot only has a 1.5\" speaker just for responses. Amazon has tons and tons of options on what you can do and control. Apple has very few. I can not only control my lights and my home alarm, but my TV, my robot vacuum, so on and so on. If I add another one I can use them as an intercom system. I can use my phone while Im at work and tell my cat to get off the furniture through it. I love it! Pretty much anything on my network can be controlled by this thing... well except my Apple devices.

I've played around with the audio on the new Dot and I'm still not completely happy. Yet at times it seems after a bit, if I turn the volume up higher, the sound gets better, voices at least sound closer to what I'm used too. I've been turning it around to see if positioning has an impact. In part, it sound muffled, and I checked to see if I missed removing any plastic like you often see on new electronic items, the stuff they put on to prevent scratches and what not, you cant tell it's there at times; but nope.\nI'm dissapointed - dredding having to send it back and end up a day or two without as I no longer have the 1st gen Dot.\nAny others having any speaker issues as described that have found by chance they aren't lasting ????

Alexa is a little tricky to communicate with but once you get used to her she is great fun. When the dots were on sale I bought two more so that I can have her read to me as I move from room to room, or have music throughout the house. One of them had a blown speaker. I got in touch with product support and the new one is on the way. In my opinion that is pretty good. I have bought 5, had issues with 1, and quick response and quick solution to the issues.

However, their are issues. The device cannot seem to consistently pick up on my voice despite being in the same place as my older model, to which I experienced no such issues, and this continues despite my troubleshooting attempts. Also, the bass is so intense, the sound so deep, that certain songs and radio programs vibrate the whole device plus the dining table it sets on, and there is also noticeable static. Perhaps if I didn't have the older model to compare this to I wouldn't notice the difference, but its tremendous and not for the better.

Not as bright as I would like but nice and warm. Kind of a pain to get it set up to work with the Echo Spot.

When my music is playing over volume 6, it is difficult for Alexa to hear my command. This is not usually the case with these devices. As a matter of fact, it is an advertised feature used to promote this device over the competing devices. If you are to buy this device, I would go ahead and buy one that is brand new.

The service rep was polite and said he could not do anything because the computers say I am out of warranty even though he could see when I purchased this from Amazon (5 months), and that he had to elevate this to his supervisor.

The design is perfectly minimalistic and just fits to anything. It is a pity it doesnt come with a battery, but that might have made the design bulkier or bigger.\n\nI would say it understands our requests 9 out of 10 times.

She reminds us to water the houseplants, take out the trash/recycle, she sets the mood everyday by playing our favorite (Nash FM 94.7), and she turns off our television every night when we fall asleep and forget.\n\nOriginal review: \"While the speakers are AMAZING, the 3rd generation Alexa in my living room isn't responsive to us.

Alexa is not as helpful or useful as Siri and can’t even simply start a book over from the beginning if you are in the middle of listening to one in audible.

It lasted only for the duration of her answer, but it sounded really bad and it was hard to understand her;\n- Another thing that bothered me last week, was that Alexa was unresponsive for some time during the day. She couldn't understand me and couldn't answer me. There was no red indication for internet problems, so I assume that it was server related;\n- amazon music really needs more categories for metal... just saying.\n\nOverall, I am really happy with my purchase and I expect that those small issues will get fixed soon."},{"reviewerName":"Starlings","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Love this!!!","reviewDate":"October 18, 2019","reviewText":"One of my favorite purchases I've ever made on Amazon.

I used to play the sounds on my fone but I would distract myself if it stopped and I would grab it and start checking social media or so. With my Echo I have no need to get distracted. It did arrive late but thats ok and It still cant understand me sometimes where I have to repeat myself a couple times . I will say vs. the 2nd gen.

Additionally, I feel like the mike is much more receptive, so it always hears me the first time I say \"Alexa.\" My biggest complaint was the CONSTANT ads for Amazon Music whenever I played a music station, but, once I linked my Pandora account to it, I didn't have to worry about that.

Being the owner of the Amazon Echo Plus and Echo Dot, I hope that I would not be deprived from using the privilege offered by Amazon.\n4.

I honestly purchased it for music to play around the house. For music it’s a good speaker, the sound quality is good and Alexa hasn’t been too far off when I ask her to play certain things. The only issue really is that the calling function is not very consistent. It won’t call from the speaker and when I make a call it doesn’t want to connect that way either. I have been playing around with it for a few weeks and there is still a problem, it will call the person I asked but the person can’t hear me and I can’t hear them.

The unboxing and setup takes less than 15 minutes from start to finish, including setting up my fiancé with her amazon account. Shes really happy with it and enjoys using it for her music.

I was really happy with ease of echo and the smart plug working side by side. It keeps my kids busy for hours with all of the games and skills that you can get with it. It connects to so many things just by simply asking it to connect. If it doesn’t do it automatically, it will simply explain step by step what to do. It integrates with IFTTT, which I have yet to try, but that’s a future plus I am sure. I really love the ability to have multi-room music, however I am bummed it doesn’t work with my fireTV stick.

My wife and I are loving it. Definitely recommend over the Google thingy that's similar. Alexa hands down wins it due to all the home automation, not to mention the ever growing library of skills you can add.

When it arrived it got set up easily but I couldn’t get it to play podcasts I wanted. After a little research I found out you have to say “play such and such podcast with tunein” which seems like a small thing but it gets annoying to say. You also can’t play a song you want if you don’t have prime which is another 100 a year and you can’t use Spotify unless you have premium that is 10-15 a month.

With the purchase of the first gen 3 Dot the improved sound quality made it clear the extra $10 was money well spent.

One complaint.","reviewDate":"January 9, 2019","reviewText":"I've been an Alexa/Echo/Dot user for years and love how easy it is to use.\nOne thing both Echo & Dot took a step backwards on is the volume control. With the old models, I could get up at night and turn down the volume without turning on a light and waking my partner. I also kept my old Dot on the top of my medicine cabinet in the bathroom. I could reach up and change the volume without being able to see the top of the device. Now, I have to pull it down, look at it, press the right button, then put it back. (Yes, I could give a command, but I am listening to a book or music and I don't want to miss part of what I am listening to while Alexa listens to me.)\nI realize the new buttons probably save 50 cents per device, but I'd spend the extra money to have the manual control."},{"reviewerName":"lsmoondancer","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"I love the Evho Dot and Alexa","reviewDate":"December 9, 2018","reviewText":"I love the Evho Dot and Alexa.

Also, bless her heart, she has a problem understanding my Southern accent. I've haven't tried asking her to define barbeque or pronouce pecan. Her answers might be fightin' words.

These skills make the echo dot highly customizable and personal. The one complaint I have is that at random times when I am listening to Spotify the sound starts becoming really muffled and scratchy and I don’t know how to fix it. I am forced to simply turn it off for a few hours and then when i come back to the Echo Dot it goes back to normal. Perhaps it is just a bug but hopefully it will be fixed soon."},{"reviewerName":"Jonshim","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Amazing aid to household","reviewDate":"August 2, 2019","reviewText":"I had been fighting getting an Alexa device for months if not years, but finally decided to get this, as it was only 222 on Prime Day.

This is good for music but creates a kind of muffling for voice ... so for just voice, it's a bit less clear, even if you boost the treble on the Alexa app."},{"reviewerName":"deb roth","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"My first smart speaker","reviewDate":"August 18, 2019","reviewText":"My kids bought this for me for my birthday.

I know a lot of people who don’t like the idea of an echo because “the mic is always on.” I don’t really care about that because I love that I can be getting ready in another room and call out for Alexa and she can here me and start playing my music. I have always used Prime music so it works great to say “Alexa play my hiphop playlist” and get the music I already have on my phone. I haven’t used it for much outside of music so i cant offer input there...but this little speaker is loud and clear as a bell.

Soon I will upgrade her to the higher model. She is very polite, extremely cordial and rather a sexy voice. It would now be hard to live without her, especially for my mornings.\nThe only thing I would improve is her ability to hear clearly. You must be pretty close and speak with great clarancy, otherwise she doesnt get it right sometimes. In them orning before coffee, that can hard to do. LoL\nIf you dont have one, buy one.

It has more bass than the 2nd generation version (which we have). That would be a good thing if the speaker were tuned properly. But there is not a balance in the treble and midrange frequencies. So Alexa does not speak as clearly as the 2nd gen version. I tried to fix the distortion with the Alexa app but it made NO difference. The app needs to be fixed before the speaker sounds good enough.

It's ability to hear, discern and execute voice commands is a welcome improvement. The grey fabric is also more aesthetically pleasing that the black plastic of the earlier version. The disappointing part is some industrial designer decided to make it ergonomic which means its bigger. The side wall surface is now curved outward (the previous one was straight) and it seems taller. If that's because (they think) the sound quality is improved, well I'm hear to tell you I can't tell the difference. If I want good sound, I Bluetooth link to my soundbar. Bottom line, at the discounted price of $19.95, get one, you can't go wrong.

You can drop in on the Alexa also like a call but instead of waiting for someone to answer the Alexa will automatically answer the call on any device in your house. Ask the weather, play any of your favorite music from SiriusXM, Pandora, Amazon Music, Spotify etc. You can set alarms, timers, reminders and even make a grocery list!
