I really find the light up system helpful especially on busy days at work when I might forget to go grab that cup of water.\n\nThis 3-in-1 speaker really shocked me at how well it works! For it to be so small, the sound is both crispy and deep, very loud. You can have the colored lights dance to the music as well which I thought was a really cool. It goes with me on my bike, in my backpack, with me around the house...\n\nAll in all a great health accessory and a heck of a conversation starter."},{"reviewerName":"Clay","rating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Best Value Smart Water Bottle - Terrible Customer Service","reviewDate":"February 28, 2019","reviewText":"AMENDED REVIEW:\nI'm really dissapointed with the customer service. I originally LOVED this water bottle (see original review below), but after a couple of months the charger broke, basically making it useless. When I reached out to them, they quickly informed me they'd send a new one, but never did. Unless you plan on purchases this several times, I'd say buy a more reliable one.\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\nSo I have had like 20 smart water bottles, and this is BY far my favorite, even before factoring in the great price. I used to have the Hidrate Spark and hated how you had to order replacement batteries from the company. While this one doesn't track your water intake, I absolutely love the light show I get every 2 hours to remind me to drink. I wish it was every single hour, but it does its job. Not only that, but the speaker volume is so loud when using it that way - it's amazing. Most other water bottles are 16 or 18 ounces, I love that this one is 22. Little things like the size of it, drinking spout, ability to recharge via USB, and closure all make a huge difference, as silly as that sounds. This is seriously my favorite water bottle ever!"},{"reviewerName":"Stephanie","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Does what it needs to.","reviewDate":"February 18, 2019","reviewText":"¬†I like this product.

I found the ICEWATER bottle on Amazon, and decided to give it a try. At 20 dollars a piece, it is very reasonably priced, which I love. First up, the aesthetics. I think they have an okay mix of colors, I mean you cannot go wrong with black and blue, can you? I like that the shape encourages a steady grip on the bottle. Plus, non-toxic and BPA-free material that is made in the USA (I always feel slightly on the edge when I see plastics coming in from the offshore industries)! My primary goal was to somehow make my husband consciously drink more water. So, the Icewater was plopped on to his work desk, and i reminded him to check it every so often. The bottles pairs well with most devices (we tried on an iPhone and two old Android devices too). After it pairs, use it like you would a speaker. THAT is what got me astounded! The speaker quality is spectacular for a bottle. Pretty decent bass too. Of course, this is nowhere near BOSE, but hey, you purchased a smart bottle remember? The bottle holds about 22 oz of water, which is decent. And that lambent glow every once a while works wonders i ensuring that my husband drinks sufficient water throughout the day. On a minus side, no adapter is provided, so we used the USB ports on our laptops to charge our (individual) bottles. I am not sure if the speakers are designed for the dishwasher, but I will say don't try. Wash it with your hands if it comes to it. In my opinion, this is a fantastic bottle for all the basic smart bottle needs.\nUPDATE: I originally purchased one for my husband, but thought about it once more, and purchased one for myself too. I mean, I like the idea of drinking out of a bottle that plays fab songs. :D"},{"reviewerName":"BonsaiRose11","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Good quality, but a bit \"smarter\" would be great","reviewDate":"February 19, 2019","reviewText":"First and foremost, this is a solid product. It does what it claims to do, and it doesn't look cheap or tacky. Where I was a little disappointed was in the fact that it isn't app-enabled. this is largely my bad for not reading the product description fully, but I assumed a \"smart\" water bottle would include some kind of smart tech element. It's great that the water bottle glows every hour, but the purpose is defeated if the water bottle isn't near you when it glows. It would be much better if it included push notifications so you're reminded to go and fetch your water bottle when it's time to drink. It's also lacking the \"how much to drink\" element. Some kind of measurement feature would be nice, or even a section in the guide outlining how much you should drink when the water bottle glows."},{"reviewerName":"Kelly Jo","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Must Buy!

I can go days and days without drinking water and only drinking sweet tea, flavored waters and juice (oops!) and I am trying hard to change that. The bottle works as described, although I don't always see the reminder light because there is no vibration or sound that accompanies it. Having said that, I have found that I don't really need the reminder light, because I like the way this bottle is set up, it makes it easier to keep on top of drinking water. I like the wide mouth feature, as I always put big lemon slices in my water, and the sport top is great so that you don't spill water on yourself (which is why I hated my last wide-mouth water bottle). The cap also features a little metal clip that can be clipped to the unlatch button, so that the bottle doesn't accidentally become unlatched in your backpack/purse. My two year old is thrilled with this water bottle and steals it from me every chance he gets, because the lights are fun and he loves to listen to music with it. The speaker was also a pleasant surprise, as it packs a punch for such a small speaker. It has nice bass and doesn't sound 'tinny' like most small/cheaper speakers. Overall, this bottle is great and I've taken it with me everywhere since receiving it!"},{"reviewerName":"Clipped Wings","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great speaker for $20.","reviewDate":"June 16, 2019","reviewText":"Edited to update rating. Seriously, buy this for the speaker alone. It's absurdly good sound for $20 and has a range of well over 30 feet (through a kitchen, a bathroom, a power conduit and two walls, it still played flawlessly. I can't speak to it's longevity, but even if this thing craps out I'll be getting another one.\n\nSurprisingly good sound quality for $20. I use it in my house just to listen to music now when not on my headphones.\n\nI bought it to use on my bike during my commute (it's incredibly dangerous to use headphones while running/biking where I live) and it fits my bike rack perfectly.\n\nHad some issues pairing it. I had to make my phone forget all other devices before it would detect the bottle, but now it pairs automatically any time I turn it on.\n\nI live in a very rainy area and can't find any info on the speaker's water resistance, but for $20 it won't be a crisis if I had to buy another.\n\nI don't have any trouble hydrating so the reminder light and dancing lights are a non-issue for me, in fact I carry a 32 oz bottle daily already so it'll be an adjustment to lose that extra volume but the speaker is nice enough to warrant the loss.\n\nI don't like the cap compared to my other bottle. It doesn't flip all the way open on its own and feels very cheap. There's also no strap, which my other bottle has, which means I lose a free hand while carrying it.\n\nDefinitely a good buy despite shortcomings."},{"reviewerName":"kunga","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"This bottle is literally a hooking up device, and much more three thing.","reviewDate":"August 26, 2019","reviewText":"It is the best water bottle in the whole world. I was hooked up with it the moment I opened the box. I love the bass feature of the bottle. When I put the bottle on my glass table, the whole table was vibrating, and I was like this is so cool. It felt like I was in a concert or a pub with this, rocking the table. With every beat, I can feel the rythim of the song. This is better than Bose headphones tbh. I was so hooked up in the bottle that I get to notice the lid machanism. How it work is really a genius. It is literally cool. Who knew a plastic that looks like a cut straw which same material as the the rubber that acts as a washer of the bottle could be used as a spring for the cap.\nBut now for the thing that I really want on the bottle as a bonus is a tattoo like design engraved on the transparent body of the bottle, not much design but little bit here and there. It could be a star or moon or clouds or fire. It will definitely complement the dancing lights feature. Thinking about it makes me really excited. I am definitely looking forward to seeing designs on the bottle. It will look Soo cool than the cool thing it is right now.\nAnother thing I want to see is that a ceiling display thing.\nI am so hooked up on this haha. I literally love the ceiling light display that I found. It is literally a plus. It can be used as a disco thing if it has a separate cap that acts as projector for the light. The disco thing could be a major thing when I am going to sleep.

It comes with instructions that are so confusing that you can't make much sense of them. The only thing I could get this bottle to do was make a random beep once in a while and twinkle colored lights once when I pressed start. The instructions say that you can get the bottle to act as a wireless music amplifier by going to your phone under devices and making a connection to \" waterbottle\". Of course , that device is not on one's phone, you have to go to your app source. There ARE apps for waterbottles , but not for this waterbottle.

I love it! It's a water bottle with a speaker! Also led lights emitting from it to remind u every hour to drink water and stay hydrated. Not only that but led lights can be used to pair up with the music ur playing! Pretty awesome from a small speaker. The music sounds nice and clear, nothing exaggerated but once u put it in a wooden surface , the bass is great coming from a small speaker like this. My only concern would be every time I wash it u may want to take off the bottom speaker portion off, it is water resistant but I wouldn't take that risk.

The water reminder sounded like a good idea, and the speaker would be a bonus. Let me say, that this is way nicer than I was expecting.\n\nFirst, the bottle itself: It comes apart into 3 pieces, the cap, the bottle, and the speaker. The bottle is easy to clean and maintain, and everything screws back together easily. It holds plenty of water, and does exactly what a bottle should do.\n\nSecond, the lights: The lights are bright, and remind you when it is time for more water. There is even a sound reactive mode for a neat little light show on your desk or wherever.\n\nThird, the speaker: This was the biggest surprise. I will admit, I wasn't expecting much from this speaker, but I was blown away. It gets loud, but also clear. If you have it sitting on a wooden surface, it also produces rich, deep bass tones. It is punchy, sounds quite a bit better than my echo dot, and the battery seems to last a very long time. (I haven't timed it, but I haven't had to charge it every day.)\n\nI am highly satisfied with this bottle and would definitely purchase again."},{"reviewerName":"Taissa","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"DOES NOT WORK!","reviewDate":"September 11, 2019","reviewText":"I was so excited about this water bottle!

She has a difficult time remembering to drink and I was hoping this cup would remind her every hour to take a drink. The problem is the dancing lights only remain one for less than 2 minutes and if you aren't looking directly at the cup you will miss the \"dancing\" lights. It took me most of the first day before I saw the lights change colors. The set up was very easy, and the speaker that is in the cup's base works great, but the lights aren't bright enough to catch your attention.

I was amazed that the speaker is so loud, not only is it loud, but you can skip tracks which is really great!"},{"reviewerName":"M.

I don't believe there are many people, if any, in the world who do. That's a problem with me, not the product. If you're looking at this, I don't know what to tell you. It does what it says on the box. If that appeals to you, you should buy it. I definitely remember to drink more water, I guess, and the sound is pretty good for a bluetooth speaker on the bottom of a water bottle. I don't pay enough attention to know if it lights up every hour to remind me to drink, but the light is pretty reflected through the water."},{"reviewerName":"Jacky Sandoval","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Not bad, like it!","reviewDate":"March 24, 2019","reviewText":"First, I didn‚Äôt give five stars because getting the reminder light to work is a bust. Lol I have no idea how, and I‚Äôve tried all settings and reading the questions on here but nothing. So...that‚Äôs going nowhere. I feel like the instructions could be far more clear on this. Also, colors in the pictures aren‚Äôt clear enough. The pink looks more rose gold in the pics but in reality it‚Äôs baby pink.\n\nOver all, though, it‚Äôs an awesome bottle. The lights are beautiful and you can make them move to the beat of the music. The speaker is clear and loud!

So every time you drink water you get drenched! First off I‚Äôll say the water bottle is great! The lights. are great. I‚Äôm not sure how the lights are suppose to display. I feel my bottle is a little bipolar. One day it goes off every two hours next day it‚Äôs every hour ü§î Either way I stay hydrated. Speaker sound is great however a lot of Bluetooth connection issues. Again, not always but some days the speaker plays for hours and hours until it dies. Other days like today, fully charged speaker is disconnecting every 2-3 minutes. Very frustrating.

The speaker is surprisingly loud and clear when you play music, I expected a low-quality speaker but that's not the case. I noticed that the silicon part of the top can pop out if you want to clean it but make sure to push it back in where the nub doesn't completely pop out of the other side, otherwise it won't create the watertight seal to prevent the water from spilling out when you tip the bottle over."},{"reviewerName":"Makingmemoriescrafts1978","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Awesome Bluetooth speaker","reviewDate":"March 20, 2019","reviewText":"But this to help me keep track of my water intake.

This is the perfect bottle to take camping - it can play music through Bluetooth, goes with you if you're out having a picnic or chilling by the campfire, and of course keeps you hydrated. It can actually get pretty loud, too, without sacrificing sound quality! (Note: we didn't let it get too loud while camping because we're not jerks).\n\nThe only negative is the bottom (Bluetooth/speaker) is impossible to remove, so I can't actually put it in the dishwasher and I have to be very careful when washing it by hand.

If you are not looking at the bottle, you might miss the it.\nBluetooth connect with any device without any pairing mode. If you are in office and not connected the speaker to your device, anyone else can connect to your speaker and play anything making thinks embarrassing for you.\nSuggestion for next model:\nAdd a pairing mode, so a device can connect to your speaker only when Bluetooth is in pairing/discoverable mode.\nAdd a sound option for hourly alert or keep the glow light alert 'ON' till some one manually turns then off after drinking water."},{"reviewerName":"Karlee Wyatt","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Fun and practical!","reviewDate":"October 7, 2019","reviewText":"I bought this for my daughter and she loves it.

So water bottle doesn't hold as much water as I'm used to. And when I use speaker while disconnected from the rest of bottle it subtly, slowly moves across surface of table LOL.

The one issue I have though is it arrived broken. The speaker button to lower volume does not work. The pause and raise volume have a click while the lower does not, it doesn't really hinder my experience much so im not going to bother returning it, but its worth mentioning. I may take it apart later and see if I can mend it but the rubber surrounding the speaker is glued in two places."},{"reviewerName":"Carol Adams","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Better than other Smart Water Bottles!","reviewDate":"April 2, 2019","reviewText":"This smart water bottle goes above and beyond other bottles I was contemplating spending more money on.

It still works just as it did the day I took it out of the box. I love the glow it gives and the bluetooth speaker has really come in handy in our office.

However, after 3 days of use, the latch/spring to open/close the bottle literally just popped out of the socket as I was trying to close the bottle and now it is no longer usable as a water bottle because it doesn't close.

The cable included is universal. Charging time, about an hour and a half, I expect the time is faster charging from a strip or wall outlet. Bluetooth pairing is easy, but it doesn‚Äôt share with other devices. I could not use the sound bar and bottle speaker together.\n\nSo I paired with my android phone. If you like loud, this speaker can get loud. I haven‚Äôt experienced the increase in bass when placed on wood surfaces. Amazing range, I carried my phone upstairs, closing doors behind me, walked through all the rooms before returning downstairs and re-entering the kitchen where I left the bottle. The signal never dropped.\n\nThe lights change colors or can be set on a single color. Two or three of these bottles set on red and green would make a nice holiday decoration. It goes without saying, this is a neat gift, Christmas or any time of the year.\n\nThe power base screws free from the bottle and functions on its own. The bottle is plastic, flip top\n\nI forgot to turn the power off before going to bed and the battery was not dead when I woke this morning.

I couldn't figure out how to get it to light up to ‚Äòremind‚Äô me to drink‚Ä¶ the light changes color, but it‚Äôs not very visible. Is it supposed to remind me merely by changing color? No idea.\n\nIt makes an annoying ding every time you turn the light on, because it‚Äôs turning the speaker on. Why do I need to run sound through‚Ä¶ my water bottle? Kinda perplexing. On a picnic maybe. Or if you are one of those people who plays music out loud as you hike/run.\nWhen it's low on battery (which happens too quickly), it says loudly ‚Äòlow battery‚Äô which is just unnecessary.\n\nThe lid is cheap and already cracking. I do like that it has a metal piece to hold it on so it won‚Äôt open accidentally.\n\nIt‚Äôs ok as a weird novelty gift I guess.\n\n---- Update a few days later ----\nI received an email and a text message from the seller of this, bribing me to remove/amend my review.

The speaker sounds good and can be played quite loud.\nAs a water bottle, it does not leak and is easy to open. It has a metal wire clip to keep it closed. I have only one concern with the bottle and that is dropping it. It has a heavier bottom with a rubber pad so it will likely bounce if it falls in that direction. If it hits on the lid...I had a similar bottle with a plastic lid catch that broke the first time that I dropped it. I don't intend on testing this bottle by dropping it and I must emphasize that this is a concern not something that happened with this bottle.\nThe bottle itself seems to be tough and well designed to hold in your hand or place on a table."},{"reviewerName":"Spike D.","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Nice bottle with extra features!","reviewDate":"December 17, 2018","reviewText":"The only complaint I have about this bottle is I could not take it with me on my bike ride. The hard plastic makes it difficult to put in/take out of the bottle cage. I think it is suited more to take in the office, when you could be working away and forget to drink water. However, if this is the main reason to get this bottle, there plenty of other things that remind you of something. My watch tells me to get up every hour, so I'd go and drink water at that time.\n\nThis water bottle is cool. Beside a decent bluetooth speaker at the bottom (that could be so convenient for a bike ride), you have changing colors that serve as a reminder. This also an opportunity for you to get up and stretch. The speaker can be detached from the bottle if you don't want to carry the whole thing."},{"reviewerName":"DF","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Silly but I have no complaints","reviewDate":"December 30, 2018","reviewText":"This is everything it claims to be, a water bottle with pretty lighting that makes the water glow, with a built in bluetooth speaker that does sound good, with a reminder that you need to drink.\n\nIt's also kinda silly, and I'm constantly asked why my water bottle is playing music or talking.\n\nPairing was extremely easy, as was getting the lighting to work (hold pause and it glows and rotates colors, which is pretty if you're biking at night). Every 90 minutes I got an audible indicator to drink. The sound is loud and clear, and while the range isn't exactly home theater, it sounds a lot better than my phone and is great for music when you're out and about. I noticed battery life isn't amazing. Within three hours it was dead.\n\nAs a water bottle, I have no complaints. It didn't leak, it was easy to sip from, and the speaker is well isolated and safe when filling the bottle, which screws onto the speaker part. The plastic is tough, and though it gets little scratches, I've dropped mine hard and it's still working great.\n\nFor the money it's got a lot of features. They aren't featured you needed but they work as advertised and I think this is an amusing product."},{"reviewerName":"loce_the_wizard","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"It's a strange product that shows we live in strange times","reviewDate":"December 26, 2018","reviewText":"My daughter needs to up the amount of water she drinks and the idea of a water bottle that changes colors to remind one to guzzle water seemed an interesting gimmick. It sort of works but like everything else, the changing light becomes part of the background after a day or two. It does not keep ones attention. The speaker actually sounds better than expected but one should have pretty low expectation for a speaker melded into a water bottle, I suppose.\n\nIs it worth the money? Maybe for some folks who do need gimmicks to remind then to tend to their thirst or who want to listen to podcasts at the beach. It's a strange product that shows we live in strange times."},{"reviewerName":"Jeff Edwards","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Damn Near Perfect","reviewDate":"March 18, 2019","reviewText":"I honestly thought this bottle had some color changing tech built-into the plastic, but no, that isn't it at all. It is not only a bottle, but also a mini bluetooth speaker which operates the colors in order to remind you hourly to drink your water or whatever it may be you are hydrating with.\n\nIt's always a good reminder to dink regularly, but an added bonus of a speaker too? Now that is pretty dang cool. The only way this could be better is if the case had been made so that it was more insulated in order to keep the contents cold or hot longer. Honestly, this is the only thing I can see that could be improved upon.\n\nThe speaker is not bad, especially considering how small it is. But with that said, it still is a pretty decent speaker. Don't compare it to an expensive JBL or Bose, but for what it is and what it does, I was pleasantly surprised how good it was. Just keep that in mind.\n\nAll in all I'm quite thrilled as to how cool this is.

It includes a lock to prevent the bottle from accidentally opening up inside of a backpack, etc.)\n- It‚Äôs easy to clean, which is appreciated.\n\nWhat needs improvement:\n\n- The speaker does not play Bluetooth music well. I have an iPhone and tried to stream music to it (a couple of feet away); the signal cuts out every few seconds. It reminds me of a cellphone that‚Äôs just about ready to lose its signal.

Our italian friends asked informations about it because it's impossible to find such an original bottle like this here! It has lights and bluetooth speaker! Fabulous! I highly recommend it!"},{"reviewerName":"iReview","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Well made but not sure I really need this!","reviewDate":"January 24, 2019","reviewText":"Interesting to have a water bottle that glows in different colors and has a speaker. The sound isn't great. I am really not finding a purpose for this.

Score for me! The lights are a fun reminder to hydrate. The speaker gives a great sound- much better than I expected. Even with the speaker at the bottom it is still lightweight enough. Also the clear cap that covers the drinking spout is very secure. I've had no problems with leaking when the bottle is sideways in my car or backpack."},{"reviewerName":"Anna Marucci","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"I love this water bottle!","reviewDate":"July 30, 2019","reviewText":"Wow!

The size is great too. Not huge and bulky but not small where I have to fill it up all of the time. And the sound really is amazing.

And boy did the ICEWATER Smart Bottle do the trick.\n\nFor starters,the actual speaker has some good clarity and low end. Shakes the water inside like that one scene from Jurassic Park when the T-Rex First shows up. Truly sounds high quality went into the speaker itself.\n\nThe bottle holds just the right amount of fluids I would need working as a mechanic. You truly can pop this thing open with one hand. But Popping it back on requires some force. No biggie. What I don‚Äôt like is the latch can sometimes not pop off all the way and instead just ‚Äúpops‚Äù. Lid stays on but now it isn‚Äôt locked and you can freely move it back, but that was just one thing I didn‚Äôt like that I had to mention.\n\nThe added light effects are bright enough for me during the day to notice and mesmerizing at night. The strobe effects blend well with whatever music is playing. Pretty great. What I would‚Äôve wanted though were more patterns of colors and more colors to choose from. I know that maybe giving us more than just Dance Mode would‚Äôve confused the Hydration Reminder with user presets but maybe different colors,haptic feedback? Probably ways to make the reminder stand out a little more than it does here.\n\nOther than that I can‚Äôt much complain. It more than delivers on what it says and I am completely satisfied with this product as a mechanic looking for music without getting into trouble and giving it more useful purpose to me than just play music. No part of the bottle offering is sacrificed in quality."},{"reviewerName":"Kim","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Clever Way to Hydrate","reviewDate":"February 14, 2019","reviewText":"Quick shipping.
