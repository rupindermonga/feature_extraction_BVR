BUT, I do feel deceived by amazon on this.\n\nThe Echo Plus does have a \"smart hub\" that uses Zigbee to connect to various smart home devices. HOWEVER, the Echo Plus can only utilize the PHILLIPS HUE system in a limited capacity. In order to get full use out of the HUE bulbs, you still have to buy the HUE BRIDGE.\n\nWhat you can do with the Echo Plus alone:\n1. Voice Control the lights.\n2. Change the color of the lights by voice, BUT you are limited to about 20 colors instead of the \"16 million colors\" that the HUE bulbs are capable of.\n3. You can set routines and groups, which is nice.\n\nWhat you CANT do without the HUE Bridge:\n1. Compatibility with many more sensors\n2. The ability to automate and set scenes\n3. get system updates over the air and future features.\n4. Have your lights sync with music\n5. Probably more, but I can't remember.\n\nAlso, if you change devices, or switch to a HUE hub, odds are you will have to redo all of your lights.\n\nWhat bothers me more than anything is that the product page for the Echo Plus CLEARLY states compatibility with the HUE system, and even use the HUE APP logo as shown in the picture. That's great, except that you MUST have a HUE BRIDGE to use the app, which is another $50-60 on top of the already expensive investment of the bulbs.\nCraig\nI would like to see Amazon clarify that the HUE BRIDGE is necessary for the full HUE system, but I doubt it will happen. Alternatively, I would to see them bundle the Echo Plus and HUE together so that you can get the full system right out of the box.\n\nHope this helps,\n\nCraig M"},{"reviewerName":"Chris_in_MA","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great Device with Impressive Audio","reviewDate":"October 16, 2018","reviewText":"Short & Sweet - For what it is, this device is amazing. Performance is quick, audio is great, and the built-in Zigbee hub works quite well.\n\nLonger Review;\n\nAfter dragging my heels for over a year, I finally bought our first Echo (2nd Generation) back in August. I loved it so much that I got us 2 more for other areas in the house. Being able to group them and play the same music or audio throughout the house is a novelty that won't grow old for me. I've only wished that they had a little more full sound, especially at higher volume. I'd considered the last Echo Plus, but the average of reviews I read didn't make it appear to perform significantly better than our already great 2nd Generation Echos.\n\nWhen I saw this new Echo Plus listed, I pre-ordered it to \"replace\" the Heather Grey Echo in our kitchen and move that one to our bedroom. We tend to have music playing in the kitchen more than any other room, and I wanted slightly better sound than the regular Echo in there. I'm honestly glad we took a chance on this device without any reviews to go by.\n\nAppearance;\n\nAs you can see in the photos, it's pretty much identical in height to the 2nd Generation Echo. It is a bit wider to accommodate the larger speakers, and the top is slightly domed instead of being flat. A similar 7-microphone array is on top and they seem to work just as well. There also appears to be a tripod-style connector on the base of the unit.\n\nSetup;\n\nSetup was surprisingly easy as this Echo Plus detected our network settings on its own. I plugged it in, it did its initial startup, and then told me the device was connected. Simple as that.\n\nAudio compared to 2nd Generation Echo;\n\nHighs are clearer.\nMids are more natural and better-defined.\nLows are deeper.\nOverall volume is noticeably louder and sound quality is improved.\nWhen paired with our other Echos, music and audio is in sync everywhere and this device stands out above the others in audio performance.\n\nGeneral Performance;\n\nWe have a quick network and I don't notice any perceivable performance difference between this new Echo Plus and our regular 2nd Generation Echos. Everything seems to work as it should.\n\nI bought this with the \"free\" Philips Hue bulb promotion. This bulb is our first Zigbee device and works very well with the Echo Plus. It is easily controlled by either the Echo Plus or the other Echos we have in the house. I'll be keeping an eye out for deals on these bulbs in the future. Like our other Echos, it also has no problem controlling our Kasa Smart Plugs.\n\nOverall;\n\nWhile $150 is a lot for a single speaker, for what I was looking for, this thing excels. If you like the 2nd Generation Echo but hoped it sounded a bit better, I would highly recommend this. Based on what I've read, if you were disappointed with the audio performance with the 1st Generation Echo Plus but want everything else it had to offer, consider giving this wonderful speaker a try.\n\nP.S.: The internal ambient temperature sensor seems fairly accurate and nice to have included."},{"reviewerName":"EyeLoveGlasses","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"If You Are Undecided .. Dont Be ... BUY THIS ECHO","reviewDate":"October 15, 2018","reviewText":"I jumped on the Echo bandwagon as soon as the original was released a few years ago. Loved it. When the Echo Plus with Built in Hub was released in 2017 … Nice. The hub gave me the luxury of controlling my garage door after buying Nexx Garage. With these two Echo's - I also purchased the Amazon Voice Remote because the Echos did not have much range for \"listening\" around corners and from different rooms. The Voice Remote was essential, but solved the issue. I also added an Echo Dot in an obscure corner of the house for better Alexa coverage.\n\nWhen the Echo Plus with ZigBee (2nd Generation) was released in October 2018 … I stressed over whether I should take the plunge and add another. Would it be \"that\" much better? I DID buy it and I am soooooooo glad about my decision.\nPROS: #1 - Pairing accessories with this latest version is easy and intuitive. Everything works flawlessly. My previous two Echos had me ranting in frustration when trying to add a smart home device. And most ended up being returned out of failure to pair. #2 - The internal microphone is so finely tuned - I can call out commands from other rooms and even outside the house (when the windows are open) and Alexa responds perfectly. #3 - THE SPEAKERS. Oh the sound is phenomenol !! Yet - I was going to call Amazon support because there was a \"rattle\" sound frequently from the speakers/unit when playing music. I went next to the unit to record the \"rattle\" so I could play it for the tech rep when I called. It was them that I realized the speakers were so dynamic - they were rattling my fine glassware that was in close proximity to the Echo. Once the glassware was moved - the speakers are sensational and flawless. I play Spotify all the time now. It sounds wonderful on the new Echo !!!\n\nThis 2nd Generation Echo is worth every penny and then some. I now have my entire house paired with receptacles, light bulbs, my garage door opener and a Phillips Color Hue bulb. Pairing and grouping everything was absolutely simple !!! There is never a glitch in operating the accessories. AND best of all - I know what I will be buying for family holiday gifts."},{"reviewerName":"Britney","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Surprised","reviewDate":"November 28, 2018","reviewText":"These were on sale for Black Friday/ cyber Monday. I didn’t see the point in having a robot listen to mine and my family’s every word. I read reviews and my boyfriend and I laughed at people saying they have 7 or 22 of these around their home, “what weirdos” “how lonely do you have to be?!”. I thought you just ask questions and she replies. How stupid.... WELL we love this. We purchased this one and a 3rd generation dot (one for the living room and one for the kitchen) I ordered the 2nd generation for as a grab bag gift for Christmas because everyone almost passed out last year when they saw that this dot was in a pool of gifts. We’re keeping all three. Living room, bedroom and kitchen, we even bought the light bulbs that Alexa can turn on. This thing can make grocery lists and it’s automatically on mine and my boyfriends phone (love love love this shopping list feature!!). We can talk to each other from one room to the next, my boyfriend keeps playing the worst music from the bedroom into the living room while I’m cleaning just to get a laugh. This is a nifty thing and we love them. If the government is listening to our every word, we’re going to get our own reality show.

It’s amazing how much better two properly spaced speakers can sound, even without a sub. Unfortunately, Amazon decided to release this product without full feature parity of it’s competitors.\n\nAs other reviews have mentioned, the stereo configuration ONLY works when streaming music from an online service. If you’re internet is out, or you want to take the speakers somewhere where no internet is available, you can only play from a single speaker at a time. That means local connection methods, like bluetooth and the 3.5mm aux in don’t play on a stereo pair (like they do with Google Home).\n\nI am really hoping this is a software kink that is quickly being worked out, and if support is added I’ll update this review. For now, I’m quite disappointed that I purchased a stereo pair of speakers and sub when half the time I only hear sound out of ONE of the three devices.\n\nDo yourself a favor and get a Google Home, Sonos, or if you don’t mind wires and want Alexa, get a Klipsch ProMedia 2.1 with an Echo Dot— much better stereo sound, lower price, and more functionality."},{"reviewerName":"Charlotte Keith","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Satisfying sound when paired, loud volume","reviewDate":"October 19, 2018","reviewText":"I really like the sound on these two speakers combined. I have a Bose, which always outperformed other small sound systems for me, but the Echo 2nd Gen--although individually not quite as good soundwise as Bose--sounds just as good when the two speakers are paired, and along with the subwoofer slightly outperform the Bose. The trebles are clear and the bass isn't overwhelming, but it's a good solid sound and feel. There's a good balance between treble and bass and you can ask Alexa to decrease or increase both. The volume level can also get extremely loud, which I found has been lacking in most speakers this size. The setup can be a little glitchy with the Alexa app, which seems buggy and is not that user friendly when it comes to setting up and pairing, but even I, who is no tech wiz, was able to figure it out and finally pair everything up. I've tried so many small speakers like this and have always been disappointed, so I'm glad I finally found some that live up to my expectations. Super happy I bought these. I'll definitely be keeping them."},{"reviewerName":"Chris C","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"No Bluetooth Stream","reviewDate":"October 25, 2018","reviewText":"Bought the combo deal, two echos and subwoofer.\nIt was a Nightmare to have them connected as stereo output.

The subwoofer really does make a difference to your music.\n\nNow here is my real issue. It only allows you to play stereo music through amazon music app or if you tell alexa. Which is unnaceptable because their apo is garbage and laggy. Sometimes it plays stereo and sometimes it only plays it through one echo and no subwoofer.\nCant stream from another source or just connect your phone to the stereo source which I hope they fix in an uodate."},{"reviewerName":"Wayne Russell","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"CANNOT GET ZIGBEE HUB TO WORK","reviewDate":"October 28, 2018","reviewText":"I Followed directions to get Hue bulb to connect. It came with the Echo and the directions say: To set up your free bulb, plug in and set up your Echo Plus, plug in your bulb, and ask, “Alexa, discover my devices.\" All I get is \"no devices found\" even when turning on skill in the app. I have a hue account set up and logged in. If you try to join the Hue app itself it said \"no bridge found\". I asked Alexa \"is Hub turned on\" and get no answer. I ask to \"turn Hub on\" same thing. I went and bought another HUE bulb and it does not work either.\nI bought this for THE HUB, but it does not seem to work. I'm sending back.\n\nOn a side note most new home automation devices are WIFI now and do not need a hub. I just wanted to connect my older devices without an external hub.\n\nI like the idea, but if I would make one of these I would have made a hub that worked and would have included Z-wave in the hub as well.\n\nI'm sending back and ordering the ECHO without the hub. I also ordered a samsung gen 3 HUB to go with it and all will be good.\n\nI do think the ECHO with the better speaker design is a great Alexa device. I love Alexa and everything the dot and Echo do, I just think the Built it hub didn't work out for them so well.\n\nADDITIONAL INFO:\nWe even tried to connect our front door lock that was Zigbee and it would not connect in pairing mode. Tried several times and no luck. I think the HUB on the device I bought must be defective.\n\nI have been working with home automation since the first generation and are very familiar with programming.

It’s nice not to have to separately turn the Bose on (how lazy is that?).

I'll not rehash that experience so Amazon will not call me again. OK if you don't have one of these Hubs they are cool and I like over Wink, GE and Hue. Hue hub I gave away but still use Wink for Zwave and Stanley locks. I run all the switches and WiFi off Alexa/Echo hub. Now I have Alexa both gen 1 and 2 hubs running. Good news this one just sync's-up and no issues so far. So why did I purchase this well for temperature sensor and most important stand alone automation when WEB is down. Temperature works great if you wish to know as she runs 1.5 to 5 degrees hotter then the room when in use especially if you are enjoying the my opinion improves sound quality. So great if you want to take her temp but a word of caution if you are running heating/cooling automation off her reading alone. As for standalone light controller when internet is out also, guess that is some enhancement as I couldn't get it to work just got the typical RED ring. Why 4 stars, 1 because it is cool, 2 because it works kind-of, 3 because I purchased it after know what gen 1 was like out of the box and 4 so Amazon won't call asking me about my review. Really is a fun great product nice new Android App update is what I use as the main driver for home automation after giving up circa 1978 X10/BSR system till a few years ago. Why not 5 stars?

Deep, richer and perhaps even louder than the old. I did like the old volume control (turning the top of the device) as opposed to buttons (so 1990s), but since I rarely use that function, I can live with it. The only down I can think of is the \"smart home hub.\" I don't know what it is, how to use it, whether it can replace the ones I already own, or where to find information about it. I posted a question pre-sale, but never got a response.

However, there are several things I don't care for so much:\n\nFirst, the \"Line In\" feature doesn't work. I've contacted Amazon support and they've said a fix is on the way, but I don't have an ETA on that so for now I'm only giving this one star. This is because the primary reason I purchased this device over others was the fact that it offered a Line In feature, which my wife wanted to be able to use our old iPod to connect it to the speaker. This is a pretty big defect, especially when it is advertised as a distinguishing feature.\n\nSecond, getting Alexa to recognize requests for specific albums is difficult. The phrasing has to be precise, otherwise she'll respond that she can't find the requested album and proceed to suggest something \"similar\". This wouldn't be so bad except usually I don't want to listen to something \"similar\" and I'm not so sure the suggestions are always good. This problem isn't so much unique to Alexa as I have similar issues with my google home, but google seems to be more responsive. I just don't like having to talk over Alexa to get her to stop talking so I can move on. I also find Alexa to be a bit more cold than my google home assistant, perhaps a little more robotic.\n\nI do like that the Echo Plus seems more responsive to my voice compared to the Google Home. Perhaps the mic is better in the Echo Plus than the Google Home.\n\nSound quality is OK and is comparable to the Google Home.\n\nThe \"smart\" light bulb that comes with the Echo Plus is only \"OK\". It was easy to set up, but I was disappointed that it couldn't do anything more than turn on/off and dim (I was kind of hoping for the ability to change colors). It also took me a bit of time to find a use for the bulb. Needless to say the use cases for a \"smart\" light bulb seem limited."},{"reviewerName":"A.

I had to do a factory reset because it got stuck on a notification that it couldn't play because it had disconnected from the internet, then it got stuck on a red ring immediately after. I had to delete everything I had worked to set up just a few days before in order to do the factory reset. It was working fine for a few weeks after that, then today it stopped playing my Spotify music, I had to relink my spotify premium account and reconnect the echo plus to the internet via set up mode, then it played spotify but could not access my playlists. When I asked \"Alexa, play my *name* playlist on spotify\" it would play a random playlist on spotify by the same name. Now is has unlinked from my spotify again, even though in the Alexa app it says I'm linked and good to go. I have given up.\n30% of the time it will misunderstand me or not hear me at all, and I speak loud and clear in anticipation of it not hearing me correctly and it is in the center of the room so the microphones aren't blocked. I have overlooked most of these little bugs and brushed it off as this relatively new tech still finding its feet, but today's spotify fiasco was the last straw for me.

I love this and now have dots in just about every major living space in the house and the Echo Plus in the kitchen.\nThe intercom feature is great for my teen who loves to shut her door and listen to music on the end of the house. I highly recommend the Echo Plus. Sound quality is perfection as well!!\n\nBonus: My five year old was not listening to me before the bus one morning. Instead of getting upset, I decided to set a reminder for 1 minute. One minute later Alexa came on and said she should put on her jacket and boots like your mom said or she will notify Santa that she was not being a good listener. I have never seen her move so fast in my life!!"},{"reviewerName":"Michael MacGregor","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Horribly, horribly glitchy.","reviewDate":"October 23, 2018","reviewText":"Saying the device I received was buggy is an understatement. Within a few minutes, it stopped being able to respond to requests. “Sorry, something went wrong.” What went wrong? No indication from the device or in the app. “Sorry I didn’t get that.” I’m two feet in front of it, and it can’t understand yes, no, or stop. Had to unplug it to stop music playback. It seems like after a minute or two of use, it just falls apart. Meanwhile my other Echo Dots have been without any issues since day one.

I remember getting my first plus and was disappointed with the poor sound quality. The 2nd gen definitely addresses that.\n\nOverall the echo devices are great I control much of my house, lighting, alarm, and temperature through my echos.\n\nWhat I like most is that the 2nd gen removes the need to have a hub. I actually avoided smart devices like the Phillips hue that required a hub. Now I don’t need to avoid them.\n\nFor the money this is a great device on its own.

I Googled Alexa (instead of calling Amazon for help) and found this site that looked like it was an Amazon site. They had me try to download the Alexa app, but the download failed each time because the website it rigged to always show a failure. That is how they get you to purchase their product. They tell you that you have viruses on your computer and go through quite an elaborate scheme, taking control of your computer, pretending to scan and clean up the so-called viruses. All of that is fake. They are not really doing anything. It only appears that way. I had a gut feeling about this and called Amazon. At Amazon, I was told that they would never try to sell you something to fix the issue and that they had no record of my call.

The two in the kitchen/living area are paired as a stereo. I found that the separation between the two Echo's is a bit spotty at times when paired as a stereo. Still trying to figure out a way to pair them both with the sub without them playing as a stereo. I think getting the full range out of each Echo would sound better. The sound quality gets spotty (pun intended) as you increase the volume. Two Echo's and a sub are not a replacement for a high end sound system obviously. But the convenience is nice being about to group areas on the different speakers/zones and have music everywhere in the house. I do wish a equalizer was available in the Alexa app for each speaker. I know the ability is there to achieve this with the technology that is in the Echo plus but Amazon has apparently decided not to provide that capability. Since I have a home office my attempts to mesh Alexa and Cortana (Windows 10) have been a bit frustrating. Although that is a skill that Alexa has -Cortana still needs work on the Microsoft end and it would be nice if Amazon and Microsoft provided a more fluid work productivity venue for the millions of us that work out of home offices.

A pair of them would make for a much better overall music experience, as a single mono device just isn't ideal when it comes to enjoying music... So, when the Echo Plus (2nd gen) arrived offering a built in stereo pairing feature/utility via the Alexa app, I immediately jumped onto getting a set of them and traded in my original Echo.\n\nThe first let down was the sound. The original Echo simply sounded a bit better. It could go louder, and the sound was just clearer/cleaner. Perhaps it is the quality of the materials used in the original Echo, which just seemed more like a premium device as to fit/finish and the richer sound. Fine I thought - but certainly having a pair of the newer units would make up for a better overall Echo experience? Well, no, not really. Sound wise, even paired, I feel the original Echo just sounded cleaner/clearer. The bass was less muddy and the dynamic range was also a bit better, especially at higher volume levels. Now I'm not talking about a night and day differences here, but still, I fully expected the Echo Plus to have evolved somewhat in the sound department... and that simply isn't the case here.\n\nSo all in all, if you are looking to upgrade for improved sound, well, there isn't really any reason to jump ship. Stick with your original Echo or explore the Sonus One speaker that has Echo support if you really want to upgrade your sound for music playback.\n\nNow, my biggest gripe about the paired Amazon Echo Plus is the fact that it is ONLY paired for music playback. Other than that, it acts as TWO completely separate devices. This is especially frustrating in a kitchen environment where you use timers and alarms all the time. Example: Ask Alexa to set a 15 minute timer. It does, choosing whichever Echo unit heard you I guess. Now walk around the kitchen and then call out, \"Alex, how much time left on my timer?\"... And low and behold, the other unit hears you and responds telling you that you have no timers set! WHAT? With a stereo pair, you have to remember which device took your timer request and ensure that you are only speaking to it in order to get any info out of it? Really? How hard would it be to just have them act together in unison as one unit!? Why not provide that as an option? A paired set should behave and act as a single Alexa device! They should respond in unison to commands - which they do not! They should also know about each other timers/commands, but unfortunately they do not. Right now, stereo pairing is NOT what I expected. It only plays music in stereo paired setting, nothing else. Rather than getting a nice volume boost when responding to commands, you get just a single speaker. This is a tremendous let-down for having purchased two premium devices and wanting to use them together. If Amazon would fix this MAJOR issue, I'd easily raise my review to 4 stars. My original Echo was easily a 5 star device. The newer Echo Plus (2nd Gen) is only a 3 star device if you buy 2 of them and use them as a stereo pair. Purchased alone, I'd raise it to a 4 stars. (-1 for the poorer sound quality compared with the original Echo)."},{"reviewerName":"John","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"New Echo Plus is amazing!","reviewDate":"November 5, 2018","reviewText":"We absolutely love our new 2nd generation Echo Plus!

The Bluetooth connection breaks up when connecting to a my Macbookpro Bluetooth speaker. Invocations for Skills do not always work for some developers and Alexa does not pick up on this issue and recommends actions that is not related to the command. When sending a command to open a radio station on one of the radio channels Alexa does not recognize the command and continuous to open to incorrect station. Even though I send feedback to the app to indicate that it was the incorrect station, I continue to get the same results. The system is not learning my most frequent commands. But the sound is great, the system is practical for timing and mathematical conversions, the list function is GREAT! The biggest learning curve is understanding how Alexa pulls information and from where. Once you learn the way to structure commands and where it should come from (i.e. Skills, Amazon Music...etc.) you can make good use of it. There were basic search engine requests given that Alexa didn't know. This makes me wonder what search engine or data base is it pulling information from. There shouldn't be any different between typing in the Google Search Engine and getting a result and asking Alexa a questions and getting a similar result."},{"reviewerName":"Merv","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"For great sound and better value than Bose 500 and Sonos One buy the Amazon Echo devices","reviewDate":"January 20, 2019","reviewText":"We bought 1st generation years ago and loved it, but for playing music we used our Bose Soundtouch 10. So our kitchen, dining room and bedroom had two speakers taking up space, the Echo and the Bose. Now the New Generation Echo devices with their new speakers are so very good plus so very small that we decided removed our Bose speaker from the dining room. In the kitchen and bedroom, we bought the Echo Shows which they also have great sounding speakers. We almost bought the Sonos One with Alexa, but after comparing them side by side in a show. We bought the Amazon Echo devices based on the equally sound and the better price. We paid $69 for the Echo, $99 for Echo Plus and not $199 for the Sonos. The Echo Shows, We paid $179 which was still cheaper than the Sonos One. Now don’t get us started on the new Bose 500 with Alexa at $399, which barely sound better than the New Generation Echo devices and definitely not worth $300 more.

Garrick","rating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great promise but poor reliability, strange happenings, primitive app, and so-so tech support","reviewDate":"January 15, 2019","reviewText":"The promise of Alexa/Echo is awesome. Connect and automate virtually everything in your house as well as various communications alternatives and other services and functions, and be able to control it all through voice (by talking to it). The main problem, however, is that it's unreliable. For this reason I give it 2 stars. The promise of Alexa is like a dial tone (remember that?) or your Internet service. It becomes an essential part of your daily life, and you expect it to WORK 99+% of the time. If it doesn't, it seriously damages the fundamental value proposition and causes frustration, inconvenience, or worse.\n\nThere are MANY companies who make \"Alexa compatible\" devices such as Wemo, Phillips Hue, etc. including Amazon itself, and as I'm sure you've noticed, many items sold on Amazon say \"Alexa compatible\". The problem is that on a pretty much random basis, items will lose their connection to Alexa and won't work through Alexa although the item itself still operates, and/or can be controlled by it's own app (such as a Wemo or Hue device). From everything I can tell, it has nothing to do with the Wifi connection since I've tested for strong signal strength and hi bandwidth, and there is no discernible pattern. A device will simply stop operating, and you get an error message in the app that the device is \"unresponsive\", or some other message. Also, sometimes the Echo will just not recognize what you are asking. I have an Echo plus, and two Dots. For some of my switches and lights, one Echo will recognize what I am saying, but another may not. Yet they are all connected to the same account and this happens relatively randomly for a given device, again there is no pattern.\n\nSo, it's just REALLY frustrating that on a fairly random basis, Alexa will just not work for a particular device at a particular time. I have to re-set, re-discover, re-connect, or re-install that third party device. BTW, this ALSO happens with Amazon-made devices, such as the smart outlets.\n\nAlso, there are different degrees of \"compatible with Alexa\". Some third party devices work completely fine through Alexa, but others have only partial functionality compared to using their own app. This is a problem since the promise of Alexa is a single point of control, but if you don't get to fully use the features of the particular device, you may have to occasionally resort back to using the third party app for certain features and functions. Check the ratings of your third party app integration. For instance, Ring makes very popular devices such as video doorbells yet it gets only 2 of 5 stars when connected to Alexa.\n\nAlso, I don't see why video devices such as security cameras can't be viewed through the Alexa app. You can (sometimes) control the device through Alexa, but if you are using the Alexa app, or if you don't have one of the Echo video displays, you can't actually use the cameras through the Alexa app. This is a big limitation since why should you have to purchase yet another video screen to use with an Echo, and sometimes if you're not at home and have to use the Alexa mobile app, you ought to be able to see security camera video through the Alexa app instead of having to switch to the third party app. After all, isn't this part of the promise of \"controlling everything\" with Alexa?\n\nThese issues are particularly problematic when you are out of town and trying to control things at your home, so when an item doesn't work, you may not be able to correct it (such as if it requires a hard reset). And if you want to check your security cameras, you can't get the video feed through the Alexa app. If you have any significant degree of home automation, you cannot (as far as I can tell) do it all through Alexa, you have to use multiple apps.\n\nAlso, an Echo will occasionally do strange things for no reason. Yesterday, my Echo Plus started making two beeps every five minutes. All day long. My two Echo Dots did not beep, just the Echo Plus. There were no alarms or reminders set, and the Wifi in the house was fine (actually my access point is in the same room as the Echo Plus, only a few feet away, so signal strength and bandwidth are strong). When I woke up this morning, the beeping had stopped. I have no idea why. Tech support said if it wasn't an alarm or a Wifi disconnect, they had no idea why and offered to remotely reset the devices, which arguably should never be the solution for such a highly-touted system.\n\nThe Alexa app is surprisingly primitive and cumbersome despite the elegance of the overall Alexa system and Echo devices. It takes too many taps to do simple things, the navigation is cumbersome, it doesn't remember your place on a screen, it is often slow to connect with the native app of the device you are trying to control, it's unattractive, and in general it's probably the weakest link in the whole system.\n\nFinally, as far as Amazon tech support, the \"pros\" are that if you dial the number, you get a live person within a minute or so, and the person you get is eager to be helpful and sounds as if they enjoy their work and want to do a good job. The \"cons\" are that unless you are lucky, you often get a person who barely speaks English fluently and you have to talk slowly and repeat yourself. Also, they rarely know the answer you are calling for off the top of their heads, and have to put you on hold while they research it. Fortunately, they are better and faster at researching the knowledge base than we are, so I often find it still better/faster to call than to try and find the answer myself although I will first do a quick Google search to see if the answer quickly pops up.\n\nAnyway, as they say, buyer beware. Overall, I like using Alexa, but you need to understand it's quirks and limitations. Some day, voice-controlled life as promised with Alexa (or competitive systems) will be here, but today is not that day."},{"reviewerName":"BillyOh","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great new Amazon Alexa Echo","reviewDate":"October 18, 2018","reviewText":"Wow, this Echo sounds great and the voice is so natural.

I will say in general that it looks cool, sounds fine (maybe a 5 out of 10 compared to real speakers), the music playing capabilities are excellent with Amazon, Apple, Pandora, and Spotify, and the voice recognition is ok - good not great. I had no problem connecting to a Phillips Hue bulb and eventually an Echo dot and a smart outlet. I use all the time to play music and radio, control lights, and make shopping lists. I bought on sale at the end of 2018 for $97.99 which I think was a great deal.\n\nThat said, I want to focus in on a four major issues that I wish I’d known about before buying:\n\n1. Podcasts\nThere is no native podcast skill on Alexa so you need to get podcasts through TuneIn, Stitcher, iHeartRadio, etc. All my other devices (computer, mobile) are Apple products where I use the Podcast app to listen and sync. The podcasts I listen to are not all on any one of these skills so I would need to download all the ones I need to keep podcasts synced between Alexa and my iPhone which is too much trouble. Plus I have a heck of the time trying to tell Alexa what podcast I want to listen to - who remembers the episode titles or numbers of the podcast they are currently listening to? Even just asking it to play the latest episode of a podcast wasn’t working for me 9/10 times so I just gave up and figured I will connect my iPhone over Bluetooth when I want to continue a podcast. But that brings me to my next issue:\n\n2. Bluetooth connections\nI was successful at pairing the Echo to both my iPhone and iPad but Alexa can’t connect to the one I want when I ask it to. If I ask to “connect to my iPhone”, it connects to my iPad. If I ask it to “connect to my phone”, it still connects to my iPad. The only way to get it to connect to my iPhone with a voice command is to turn Bluetooth off on my iPad - annoying!\n\n3. Multiple users\nThis is a big one. It is great that the Echo can have multiple users on it, so my wife and I can share the Echo using our separate accounts which are linked in Prime under the same household. You can even set it up to recognize each of your separate voices. However, ONLY THE PRIMARY ACCOUNT CAN CONTROL THE SMART HOME DEVICES. This means that if I want to control the lights and the Echo is set to use my account, I have to tell it to switch to my wife’s account first, then give it a command for the lights. Furthermore, you have command it to switch between accounts to use your personal skills and settings. Given that it can recognize my voice as distinct from my wife’s, I thought that if I asked to play something on Pandora, it would automatically play from my account. Nope - I need to tell it to switch from my wife’s account to my account, and then ask it to play something on Pandora. Want to turn the lights down? Have to switch back to my wife’s account. Want to play something else on my Pandora? Have to switch back to my account first. What is the point of having voice recognition if it can’t automatically detect who is speaking and use that person’s account? And what is so useful about having multiple accounts if they can’t both control the smart home devices? I can't control the smart home devices from my app, only my wife can, and I can't set up routines either. And last, there are some things I would like to be discrete to my account only - like shopping lists and reminders - but those have to be shared, so my wife’s Alexa app on her phone is getting reminders that I set up. There are some major kinks here they need to work out, but the good news is that it’s all just software fixes so GET ON IT AMAZON!\n\n4. Routines\nAnother big one here. There is a well-documented glitch that people experience with Echos where the music stops playing after one song. You have to ask it to keep playing in order to keep going to the next song. If you google “echo stops playing” you will see lots of discussion around this. Well we had it happen to us as soon as we set up routines. Routines are little scripts you can set up - actions Alexa can take when certain criteria are met. This is one of the primary reasons we went with the Plus instead of the Dot. We have pets in the house and we wanted to set up a routine where the Echo would send us an alert if the house temperature got above or below a certain amount. Well unfortunately as soon as we set up the routines, the Echo started doing the thing where it stops playing after one song. So we deleted the routines and reset the Echo and the problem has not come back. But now I am afraid to set up any routines because I don’t want to deal with the music playback issue. I hope they fix this glitch because not having routines is a big drawback.\n\n5. Alexa Guard\nI was also excited to learn that the Alexa Guard feature can alert you if it hears broken glass or smoke alarm sounds. But it’s not available yet. Still waiting for that.\n\nIf I knew someone interested in buying an Echo, I would recommend they try an earlier generation Echo Dot which you can get on craigsist for $20-30 and see how you like that before spending $150 on the latest Echo Plus. Too many bugs still need to be fixed."},{"reviewerName":"JOEnSF","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Fantastic, but ONE MAJOR flaw makes it worthless - to me!","reviewDate":"January 29, 2019","reviewText":"I loved this fantastic piece of home automation/personal assistant technology...for about two days.

Seriously, an Apollo moon launch seemed easier than getting any one of our Echo devices back to tea quite a simple WiFi signal. After 15 minutes w tech support, we had DELETED every Echo device in our house (and deleted all our playlists, preferences and EVERYTHIG else we spent HOURS setting up. Really! I asked after the tech call went past 20 minutes with no results... Reacquiring a dropped out WiFi SHOULD be one simple voice command or button push (if the WiFi signal /credentials hasn’t changed since it was last connected). After working 45 min w tech support we still had no luck on reconnecting ANY Echo device to our lame WiFi (which can drop in and out several times a day) at which point I asked the Amazon agent - do we have to go through this entire procedure EVERY TIME our lame WiFi signal drops out for even a second, to which she replied YES - at which point I told the agent to initiate a return for all of our Echo devices and related home automation devices. They were completely worthless to me with this one GLARING flaw. (And I had all the latest 2nd and 3rd gen High end Echo devices. No one thought to fix the huge flaw in three generations of the product line)? Well maybe I’m the only one who has WiFi that comes and goes.\n\nI love amazon and regularly place orders over $1000 a month just because it’s SO easy to do and always flawlessly fufilled...except the one MAJOR, MAJOR flaw in the whole, otherwise FANTASTIC Echo series of devices. The entire dropped WiFi signal SHOULD be fixed (provided the WiFi credentials haven’t changed) with a simple ALEXA, Reconnect to WiFi voice command or a one button push...and be back online and in business right away without the need of a 45 minute PLUS tech support call.\n\nEcho and Alexa are my favorite home Automation /personal assistant/ direct audio command to buy anything and everything from my beloved Amazon account, but this one flaw RUINED EVERYTHING. Other than that flaw I was fully investing into the whole Amazon Echo lifestyle, but unfortunately if your WiFi drops in and out your hosed and the entire investment in time and resources was for NOTHING!"},{"reviewerName":"Lawrence Bolger","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Miserable setup, learn from mine. Read to bottom for update","reviewDate":"November 29, 2018","reviewText":"My echo plus setup experience was very interesting! The Alexa App is instrumental in the set up, so were my headaches caused by the app or the device? After logging into the wifi system and thinking i completed all that was necessary, i was left with a message in the device area. It said echo plus not available and needs to be removed. I tried a few things, unplug, plug, hold down reset. While i could ask and get response that indicated connection to internet, the device on the app, had no other means of editing or setting up. I called support and got a very helpful agent. Together we explored aspects of the Echo interface to no avail. Finally something happened i now had a new message on app “device is recalibrating and could take awhile”!\nI asked the agent if this was unusual, and was told “very uncommon”, and she would call me back in a couple of hours.\nThings i learned, in lower right corner, icon looks like house with vertical bars. This was the access to device setting. Once my recal competed, when using the menu on left, selecting device i was greated with my room temp! Look in upper right on this screen find 3 dots. Touch those then menu for this device opens. I created a group for origional echo and new echo plus naming it “everywhere”! So now i can say “alexa play _____ music everywhere” and both units play.\nNow i need to find out how to change phone number (cell right now) to a different number, to utilize phone call out. I did use it to try it out and that worked fine.\nNow i still have question on the aux in? Can i use IPod to play my own music. As a prime member i can play what is on Amazon Music, by asking.\nOh the agent did call back as promised, so i asked her about the aux in use, the response was try it. I havent.\nSo what could make this better? Maybe a PDF style manual explaining the app interface and what icons are, and what each will do ( like the house i mentioned earlier) vs guessing.\nSounds great but came close to returning that is why i gave 3 stars.\n\nCreated new review on 2nd generation echo plus.

Most of my home automation was handled by SmartThings. With the addition of the new Plus, I have retired SmartThings and am slowing trying to have Alexa handle all of my HA tasks. The major issue holding this back is that Alexa's support for sensors is brand new and not yet fully developed. For example, the new Plus has a temperature sensors built in to it. But there isn't - currently, I hope - support for simply asking Alexa what the temp is in the room where the Echo Plus resides.\n\nOn top of which the features that are currently implements don't work so well. I created a routine that was supposed to send me a notification any time the temp in my living room got below 65 degrees. Just a simple routine to test how the temperature sensor is working. It worked sort of. I would get my notification but it would usually be delivered several hours after the trigger condition had been met.\n\nOtherwise, the new Echo Plus seems to work well. Discovering Hue light bulbs works seamlessly. The sound is much better than my 1st gen Echo, even to my ancient ears. It's smaller, better looking and so far, at least, does everything that it's supposed to do. Amazon just needs a little more time to build out the software."},{"reviewerName":"Experienced at life","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"I don't know much yet, but what I have tried, I like very much!!","reviewDate":"October 15, 2018","reviewText":"I primarily bought this because I wanted to enter the world of smart devices. I bought some google home minis, but found you had to download apps from outsiders in order to use the smart light I wanted. I looked at the privileges that were being demanded by the app and decided an app to control lighting had no reason to know who I called, when I called, or anything else about me personally. Amazon already knows me (my husband thinks they pretty much own me) so I was more in favor of using the echo plus since it has a built-in hub and no third party app or skill was desired for the smart light I bought (actually, I received a free smart light bulb when I purchased the echo plus).\n\nI had a bit of trouble getting the light to work - Alexa didn't find it at first but I reset the bulb and then I was good to go. I agree with others that the Alexa app interface is not really intuitive, but now that I have the light up and running, I am in love. My 94-year old father is not very mobile and when he comes to stay with us, I wanted him to be able to turn the light on and off while he is still in bed. This feature now works like a champ so I am very happy.\n\nI have played some prime music and that works well, but I still have a lot to learn about all the echo's features.\n\nThe only reason I would not give it 5 stars right now is the alexa app - but that is really a separate issue, so I gave it 5 stars."},{"reviewerName":"A.

I have a large great room with 40ft ceilings and it absolutely fills my home with warm sound which can be heard throughout my house, and with the \"everywhere\" group feature I can successfully play my music throughout my home on my Echo's in stylistic fashion. I've been an audiophile for quite some time and this kind of quality for something affordable blew my mind.\nI think my favorite feature is connecting this with smart home commands when paired with other devices - turning on lights, controlling my TV's, etc. It just makes everything so much simpler. I am highly anticipating future adaptability - the sky really is the limit with these devices. I would highly suggest these for your home as I have really enjoyed using them.\nThe only problem I've had so far is giving commands to play certain radio stations and the cursed \"I can't find (x)\" response. I really Alexa said something humorous when she can't find what I'm looking for, it would make it a lot less aggravating when I've been playing a Pandora or Amazon Music station and suddenly it can't find what I'm looking for.\nOther than the minor nuisance of that, I am free to stream whatever station I want via Bluetooth on my iPhone or other smart pad, which negates my only discrepancy.

There are literally thousands of things it can do for you and you're really only limited by your imagination.

Easier to use the TP-Link app. Same for Honeywell thermostats. No benefit to using Alexa.\n\nThe interior temperature sensor, that apparently took an hour to \"calibrate,\" is consistently off by 4-5 degrees.

The subwoofer is great and delivers on sound - but the ECHO Plus is lacking - it is much less receptive to commands (doesn't \"hear\" or doesn't interpret them correctly), and frequently just cuts out mid-broadcast. There's a significant delay between command and response, which suggests the pairing with the subwoofer component slows the whole system. (Maybe it's a two step process - the ECHO responds, then feeds the subwoofer, then you get the audio response.) At any rate, good sound but frustrating to use. First generation ECHO's, even the refurbished ones, are far more responsive. For a sophisticated full range sound system, there may be better smart speaker systems out there. Amazon has just offered the \"Amazon Studio\", which is an all-in-one device - but expensive. As we're too far out to return our ECHO Plus, we'll have to relegate it to the garage.

Amazon now gives you the option of doing \"speaker pairing\" that will allow you to connect multiple speakers and use them as one. The problem I'm running into is that if you are dropped in on a \"call\" (one room to another) it only uses one speaker and when you try to hang up it says there is no call connected if the \"other\" speaker heard you tell it to hang up.\n\nI love the Amazon Alexa system and I have it throughout my home for home automation and it works great, it can hear you from another room and it understands what you are asking for. There are a TON of devices you can connect to it and there are a TON of skills to use with it. I loved the idea of connecting multiple speakers as one in the master bedroom because of its size but not being able to use both speakers while making a call is not what I was hoping for. I was hoping they would act as one speaker (or a speaker set like a real stereo system) all the time, for everything.\n\nNow the worst part...\n\nI changed my review from 4 stars to 1 star because of a software update that now forces me to specify which light, power strip, and/or other devices I want to turn on/off. All of my rooms, lights, power strips, etc... are in various groups for a reason. Each light, outlet, and other devices have a unique name (IE: The upstairs hallway lights are named UH-Light, UH-Light2, and UH-Light 3, my smart power strip has unique ports like TV, Monitors, etc..).\n\nYESTERDAY (9/18/2019) I was able to walk into a room and say \"Alexa, turn the light on\" (in my home office for example) and it turns the light on, Today (9/19/2019) I'm sitting in my home office and I say \"Alexa turn the light off\" and I get the response \"There are multiple devices that share that name, which one do you want\".\n\nThe master bedroom - Setup with only lights (MBR-light, or something like that so I can identify it later when adding other stuff), the wife used to say \"Alexa, turn the light off\" because that's what she has always said before going to sleep. Today she can't do that because of Amazon's development team.\n\nSo I say \"Alexa turn the office light off\" and it turns the ENTIRE OFFICE GROUP OFF. So now I have to go to the app to turn the light off and rename EVERY ONE OF MY DEVICES so that my family can remember what each name is.\n\nI reached out to Amazon customer support who tells me I have to be specific when asking the echo to turn the light off as in \"Alexa, turn the office light off/on\" and that it has always been this way. When I tried to tell them that yesterday I was able to say \"Turn the light off\" they said it wasn't possible and I have always had to be specific.\n\nI set up groups for a reason, that being I can go into a room, say \"Alexa, turn the light on\" without having to remember each light bulb name or what I named the room/group. Yes, I know what the group names are, I don't expect everyone in my house to remember the group names.\n\nThere was a software/firmware update overnight that broke all of my Echo's and Amazon's customer support will not acknowledge it.\n\nI will not recommend this device to anyone else until they put it back to the way it was.\n\nYou would think it would be simple, it's not, apparently.\n\nUpdate 10-8-2019: Attached another picture right from the amazon website that says \"Alexa, turn off the lights\". It's still broken and doesn't work like that. Additionally, I was supposed to receive an email from the Alexa/Echo customer service department with more information, this was a couple weeks ago and I haven't heard anything.\n\nThey (Amazon) reached out to me after reading my review requesting more information, I gave them everything they needed and the rep said he would contact me again, never happened. It is a pain in the rear end, but this has been broken for nearly a month and nothing has been done about it... I keep getting emails saying \"What's new with Alexa?\" I can tell you what's new, you can't turn the lights off by saying \"Alexa, turn the lights off\".\n\nI've done everything the Customer Service Reps have asked me to do, every time it doesn't do what I ask it to do, I go into the app and report it as \"it didn't work correctly\".\n\nSORRY AMAZON, YOU ARE FAILING THIS ONE."},{"reviewerName":"Kevin lam","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"A billion times better then the echo dot, bass is loud, crisp and clear","reviewDate":"June 24, 2019","reviewText":"Bought this after I fell in love with my 2nd gen echo dot, but wanted an upgrade for me room, so I could put the dot in the kitchen for simple smart home co trolls and music during cooking. The sound in this thing is insane, for a medium sized room, I never have to keep the volume over half, and the base is crisp and beautiful, you gear every little wub and punch, unlike the dot, which only tries to mimic the low sounds with its tiny tweeter.

Yes its more expensive and a little larger however it still has the 3.5 output jack and I was looking for instant satisfaction. I already had half the system that I was intending to use with the Dot however I didn't have the receiver yet and I wasn't satisfied with the quality of the interconnects that I would be using. figuring what could it hurt to just see how good the quality of the on board speakers are I gave it a whirl. I am no audiophile but within reason almost everyone can tell when something sounds bad. Maybe not be able to describe why it sounds great in audiophile terms however we all know bad. Plugged it in set it up with the APP seems like I am the only one that still uses PC but I finally got logged in and setup and connected with my prime and started playing music. The quality of sound and the volume that is achieved with almost no distortion is amazing. Bass was only slightly lacking but this little thing has more than enough power to more than replace a solid book shelf system. Loud enough that anyone who doesn't want hearing damage is going to be screaming at you to turn it down when at volume 10. The thing I found odd and the reason this surprised me so much is I couldn't find any information on the wattage of the on board speakers. I still can't.

Later did more research on the subject and found out that lots of other people had the same issue with alexa not being able to control their equipment based on temperature.\nAnother thing I noticed from Echo Plus 2nd gen was that there was a 10 second delay before playing \"tunein\" radio, with echo dot 2, that delay was only 2 seconds.\nAnd yet another annoying thing i noticed about Echo Plus 2nd gen is: while she's not playing anything if you ask her \"set volume to (a number from 1 to 10)\" she does not play confirmation sound tone so you can't know how loud she really is, on \"Echo Dot 2nd gen\" she plays that tone which is really helpful (even though confirmation sound after each normal request is disabled in settings).\nSo for over a $100 buying a glorified mono speaker, no matter how amazing it sounds, just doesn't make sense in my opinion.\nP.S.

It's never worked reliably even for turning a light off and on. The older Echo Dots were actually more reliable than this ever was.\n\nAt any rate, I have just about reached my limit with Amazon and Echo and am looking for a competitor's product.\n\nLike eBay that used to work quickly and simply, over the years it's been bloated to the point it's time consuming and labyrinthine. I assume this is because workers and supervisors need to show results and justify their existence so over time what worked simply becomes bloat ware.\n\nAs a reult of this, now when ask what time it is instead of just answering briefly it tells me the time AND then tells me to have a nice day, or to enjoy national blah blah blah day.\n\nThink about what just happened there. A MACHINE with no real personality just took the time (and my time) to wish me a nice day. Maybe that's cute once, but it gets annoying. Imagine if you flipped a light switch in your home and instead of just doing its job it suddenly had a personality and wished you a good day, and then your toaster, and so on, all throughout the day. It's ridiculous. That's not what I bought into. I literally simply wanted to be able to walk into a room and turn on three lights at once instead of having to go around the room and do it one by one.\n\nNot even that works anymore.\n\nThe system works for awhile and then a name stops working, so if you've called it desk lamp suddenly you have to call it something else. There are only so many logical things to call it. So I've gone through a few name changes and each successive one and more and more strained to have some meaning. My living room is now \"Garden Room\" and so on.\n\nWorse still is the system repeatedly tells me a device isn't working and then I ask again just a second later and suddenly it works normally. Hey, Amazon, how about the stupid device tries three times before telling me it doesn't work instead of just the one?\n\nJust as infuriating is very clearly saying to turn something on and getting a message that says, \"A few things share the name 'table lamp.' Which one did you want? Well I've got WRITING TABLE lamp and STUDY LAMP and CONSOLE TALBE LAMPS and FRENCH LAMP and BEDROOM 1 LAMPS and BEDROOM 2 LAMPS and so on. Most of those things don't sound anything like one another, but still the device can't figure it out and constantly asks me which one I want.\n\nI suspect this has to do with waking up after you say the wake word so while it's doing that it misses the first (and more descriptive and unique) word and just starts listening at \"lamp.\" Either way, it's annoying, and I don't recall this ever being an issue with the early/simpler/cheaper Echo Dots before I got this one.\n\nEvery day is infurating, and because unlike a human it's the exact same thing, it's more maddening.\n\nI simply want to be able to say what time is it or what's the temperature or so on and get an answer, not a verbose response.\n\nEven if you want to play an audiobook and shoot the sound over from your phone to this speaker via Bluetooth that works, but Amazon in its infinite wisdom decided the speaker should (instead of just start playing your book) say, \"Now connected to blah, blah, blah.\" Just play the book and we will know we're connected.\n\nDo a Net search for Amazon Echo or Amazon Alexa and the word verbose and you will see I'm not alone in my issues here.\n\nIt's so awful even though I'm invested in this maddening system I'm looking into competing products designed by humans who actually gave them some thought as to how they interact with humans.\n\nThe devices should be adapted to US, no US to THEM."},{"reviewerName":"Tyler Kiser","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Much better than Echo 2nd gen","reviewDate":"November 29, 2018","reviewText":"I currently own a 1st gen echo, a 1st gen dot, multiple 2nd gen dots, a Fire TV Cube, and now this.

Only will play off one so you miss out on some of the rich sound when waking up. But a plus since it isn't as loud.\n\nLong Review:\nI have to say these are amazing. I have had a lot of amazon products and these surprised me the moment I started them up. First off these get loud for their size and the audio clarity is amazing. They are crisp, clear and sound amazing. Now if you like heavy heavy base then these aren't the speakers for you. I bought the package with 2 speakers and the sub and they are perfect for me. The base is well controlled and gives the sound that is lacking in many speakers but if you want the base to shake the walls and make it sound like a floor speaker with a 12 inch amplified drum then don't try. But if you are looking for a clean, rich, bold and sophisticated listening experience then these are amazing. Much better than anything I have tried in the $350 price point.\n\nIf you want something that is loud, base heavy with good high and mid tones better than this then look at spending 700 or more. I listen to everything from classical music to EDM, Rock, rap, pop, country, jazz and folk and these just keep impressing me. The vocals aren't drowned out and you can hear all the instruments and the base fills in the lows at the perfect listening experience.\n\nSummary: If you are looking for rich, deep, bold music this is the set for you. Better than anything in the 350 to 450 market. (I have tried 20 in this market) If you are looking for wall pounding, rave quality base then you better live on your own or in a frat house cause more than this you will need a floor speaker with amplifier and thick walls. PS I own a full amplified speaker set housed in my living room for when I was in college and a fraternity. Nothing against them but horrible for all day listening and having friends over to talk and not drink all day haha\n\nNote: I have both echos and the sub in my bedroom and the room is too small for all 3. I barley raise the volume past level 3, maybe 4 if I am listening to them in the shower. I moved them to my living room for the pre and post Superbowl party and they filled a medium 4 bedroom 3 bath house with crystal clear music."},{"reviewerName":"Detrick","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Good, But Not Great...","reviewDate":"January 8, 2019","reviewText":"Not much of a value at $149.\n\nSound quality is mediocre, significantly behind Sonos at $199. The built-in hub is very limited with Philips Vue bulbs - can set only 15 colors instead of 16 million. Settling on a difference of more than a million to one is difficult. Decided to keep the Echo Plus, but purchased two Sonos, which do not contain hubs and are limited in their own right with Alexa due to being third-party units (i.e. no drop-in feature, nor ability to be part of multi-room music.)\n\nThe main takeaway is the $29 Amazon Echo Dot is a fantastic value with good overall acoustic performance, whereas the Echo Plus is not. The extra cost for the improved speaker performance is not worth it, and the partially useful hub makes little sense. So if money is less of a concern, order one. But if you are on a tight budget, consider the Echo Dot without a built-in hub and only a marginal drop in acoustic performance."},{"reviewerName":"DirtDiva","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Impressive sound","reviewDate":"August 23, 2019","reviewText":"I have 2 first generation Echo's and 2 second generation Echo's.

Its also incredibly responsive, more so then the one I replaced it with. I especially like that when I have the music turned up, it still hears the wake word. As for my Mom, I have a few lights set up, probably more in the future, what I liked was telling Alexa to \"find my devices\" and it was done in a few seconds.

We had two identical ones, both replaced by these. One went to the garage where it was rarely used, noticed it was not connected about 2 weeks ago, but figured it just needed a reboot; however rebooting it didn't reconnect it. I hadn't used it in a while, figured maybe it died from the cold or something. The second was in storage in the house, so I got it out to use instead, and it powered up and connected to wifi fine - I checked weather, etc. to verify it was ok. I left it alone a few hours, it got an update and restarted, and was then in the same boat as the other one - no wifi connection can be made with any combo of settings I can try, but it does connect to the Android app via the Amazon wifi step of setup, so the hardware seems fine. All our newer Echos - Echo Plus, Echo Sub, Echo Show, Echo Show 2, work fine with the same settings.\n- the Android Alexa app pops up an error message when wifi connectivity fails during setup, which covers the first two input fields on the page (network name and password) and can't be dismissed, making it difficult to edit the form without killing the app\n- the Android Alexa app flips the phone from standard WiFi to a peer-to-peer Amazon Wi-Fi with the Echo during setup, and killing setup or failing setup leaves the phone unconnected to the internet unless you go back and reselect your normal WiFi network in Android settings\n- support was free, but very slow (3+ minutes to type each response, I think they were in multiple simultaneous chats), and ineffective - they just followed the flowchart, ignoring what I told them I had already done, and asking the same questions over and over; the only new thing they had me try was the factory reset paperclip button, but it made no difference."},{"reviewerName":"ABCruz","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Response delay tarnishes an amazing product!","reviewDate":"June 6, 2019","reviewText":"First off, I own several Echos... from the 1st Gen to Plus to Dots.

If you say \"Alexa, do this\", sometimes the first Alexa replies and sometimes the second does. The problem is that they do not necessarily realize that one has already replied. If Echo one asks a question, sometimes Echo two hears the reply instead of Echo one causing Echo one to get stuck in a loop.\n\nSometimes the two echos break stereo sync and require HW power cycle to get it together. One of the echo may lose the ability to \"Understand\" when in this state (this is NOT a wireless signal issue).\n\nIf you set a timer on these Echos, Echo one may set the timer and Echo two may then answer all other queries. Echo two is not aware of timer on Echo one. As such, Echo two cannot list, stop, or reset timers on Echo one even though they are \"one unit\". A master/slave situation should exist when Echos are setup in stereo pairs (they are ONE unit). Turning mute on one of the Echos helps, but the mute light is distracting and annoying.\n\nIn short, the sound quality gained by the stereo pair does not warrant the extreme annoyance of the buggy interaction when two Echos are placed 2.5m apart in the same room.\n\nAmazon seriously needs to work on better detection code to determine which Echo I am talking to in a multi-Echo home setup.

Turns out I was wrong. Echo Plus doesn't support Scenes, sunset/sunrise time triggers, light switches as input, and several other things. For example the Hue lights come on full brightness after a power outage. The fix requires a Hue Hub. Some switches I was looking at require their own Hub to operate. You need the hubs and Alexa can control simple devices. A hub of hubs (kind of an industry problem I suppose).\n\nMiscellaneous - Timer alerts and CONTEXT.

However, when a timer goes off one can't simply say \"thanks I got it\" -- no you have to say \"Alexa - stop the pasta timer\" \"Alexa this, Alexa that\" - yes there is a mode to chain things together, but one still needs to be explicit as Alexa lacks context.

If you tell it to lower volume, just don't know what you will get.

It's about 50/50 that it will actually turn off when you tell it too. A couple of times I have told it to \"stop\" and the volume just got very low. Repeated attempts to turn it off were ignored.

So it only creeps me out a little when my husband and I have \"test\" discussions about things we don't talk about, don't search the internet for, and would never actually buy in a million years only to see such items pushed to us in advertising feeds. Is one of our assistants listening when it is supposed to be asleep? If so, which one? All three of the majors are in our house. Both of the cats have turned Siri on by walking across my laptop. And Alexa hears her name sometimes inexplicably. Maybe it's my husband's Long Island accent?\n\nOr maybe it is just randomness and the assistants are functioning as advertised. Either way, I won't be getting rid of them anytime soon. The Echo Plus recognized all but two of my smart bulbs and found all of my switches and everything else that still works (old WeMo stuff went offline over a year ago when Belkin pushed a firmware upgrade and killed their wifi connections). It has controlled them flawlessly so far, and this has allowed me to free up the ethernet ports I'd dedicated to several different hubs.\n\nMy Echo devices are the ones we use most around here, both because the house runs on Amazon Prime and Subscribe and Save (I have lupus and cannot easily shop in the real world) AND because the Echos allow me to reach my teenager and tell him things whether he wants to hear them or not. He can ignore my texts and refuse to answer the phone, but Alexa lets me yell at him from anywhere in the world. (And the app lets me see his history of ridiculous teenaged boy questions - unlike Siri, Alexa is not a potty mouth and does not like it when you are.)\n\nOn the downside, Alexa won't give you suggestions if she doesn't know something. She just gives you an Elizabeth Jennings (The Americans) type, \"Hmmm,\" and a disappointed note.\n\nThe Echo Plus also seems to \"hear\" better and have fewer false activations. And the sound is better for music - by a surprising amount. So, if Alexa has a place in your home, the Echo Plus is a good way to get her. Four stars.

The following all happened on the first day of owning this:\n\n1) MOST of the time when I ask for music it only plays through the 1 echo, and NOT the stereo + sub. The only guaranteed way to get stereo + sub is through the Alexa app and not voice command.\n2) I'll say \"Alexa stop\" and it'll stop playing music, then I'll say \"Alexa play\" and instead of restarting or playing new music it'll say \"Not currently playing music\" and not play anything.\n3) Sometime after starting music it will play at at low volume for 20+ seconds as if Alexa is listening.\n4) After pausing music, when I restart it can sometime take 20+ seconds before playback starts.\n5) Music has occasionally just stopped playing for no reason, despite having songs left in my queue.\n6) Remote doesn't work while music is playing, only when it's not playing.\n\nThe quality of the sound is very good for the price, and once (if) they fix the bugs it'll be a terrific setup. But the voice command implementation for stereo + sub is poorly implemented and the bugs are extremely frustrating so for now my advice is to stay away.\n\nUpdate: After 3 weeks issue 1 is still happening so dropped to 1 star. Amazon say they're looking into it but unless it's fixed this will stay at 1 star as it's extremely frustrating. Also added a sixth issue above regarding the remote with the stereo/sub pair for those considering buying it.\n\nUpdate 2: After 2 months issues 1, 4, 5 and 6 still occur regularly.\nIssue 1 can be mitigated by saying \"play on stereo sub pair\" or if it's in a group \"play on <group>\". Note that setting up a group with left and right echos added and the stereo sub pair as the preferred speaker seems to improve things but the issue still occurs.\nAlso found another issue, this time with the multi-room music functionality: If I play on the multi-room setup via the Alexa app and try to interact with Alexa by voice if will often say \"No music playing on this device\" and ignore the instruction.\n\nAmazon's customer support have been great as usual trying to help and keeping me up to date with my bug reports, but the team that developed this should be ashamed of themselves, it's poorly implemented and poorly tested. A prime example of rushing the software out and letting the paying public do the beta testing. Fully deserves its single star.\n\nUpdate 3: After testing for the last month I can say issue 1 is now fixed, it hasn't occurred at all recently, and that was by far the most annoying bug.\n\nThe biggest issues now are:\n- The sound randomly cutting out midway through a song, the only way to fix is to skip to the next song.\n- The multi-room setup is flaky, sometimes I'll have the echo in the current room respond, and a few seconds later a linked echo in another room will also respond.\n- It can still take up to 20 seconds to restart music after pausing.\n\nIt's slowly getting there but it's been a very frustrating journey, and for that reason I doubt I'll ever go over 4 stars even if everything is fixed. As it is I'm increasing it to 3 stars.\n\nUpdate 4: It's been 7 months. The problem with music suddenly cutting out randomly has come back. I'm done with waiting for fixes, after 7 months it's still flaky. Dropped back to 2 stars. As a software developer with over 20 years experience, I can categorically say that Amazon's developers don't have a clue about developing quality software.\n\nLast update: After 10 months my final rating is 1 star.

I saw the Echo plus but the price (on sale) was $119 and I was hesitant to take the leap since the wife would likely be annoyed.

Is that really convenience? Other than my growing pains, this has been a neat addition to my home. Asking Alexa to play music, tell me the time, or set an alarm is very cool. I live in a small condo, and put this in the living room for some ambient music. I added some Dots in my bedroom and office for light controls and music in all rooms. I would like to see some improvement with managing device groups and playing music across speakers, like Sonos. I think the sound is sufficient for my needs, but true audiophiles or people who want really room shaking music will be disappointed.\n\nI'm definitely not using this to its full potential, but then again, I feel like 90% of the things the Echo can do are more party tricks than real quality of life improvements."},{"reviewerName":"Ty","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Very disappointing","reviewDate":"February 7, 2019","reviewText":"I bought this to add voice control to a number of smart home items and this product is very underwhelming. I purchased the plus model for the “premium sound” and the array microphones because I wanted the best sound and recognition. Unfortunately, this falls short by a long run. Alexa barely can hear any request, always telling me she doesn’t recognize lights because she can’t hear hue, or she just beeps and doesn’t do or say anything. Also, asking her to play music is a very difficult task. She will just play a random song that is nowhere near what you said. Running in to the sound quality, it sounds like a single cheap built in TV speaker. It can barely make a presence in a 12 x 14 bedroom. My 3 year old JBL flip is 3x louder which is smaller and runs on battery and sounds way better in highs mids and low frequency. The JBL doesn’t even have a dedicated tweeter like the echo does. I have friends who have the original echo and it has way better sound.\n\nOverall this is definitely a bad buy for the $150 it was.

Bad Spotify support.","reviewDate":"April 18, 2019","reviewText":"Ok device ruined by horrible Wi-Fi connectivity or non-existent cache memory. It’s the only Wi-Fi device I have that can’t stream Spotify reliably. It’ll often cut out mid track and then skip to the next one. Even when it’s working perfectly, it has a 2 second delay when skipping tracks unlike other Spotify Connect devices which are almost instant. I’ve given up on fast forwarding into a track. It’ll often cause it to skip to the next track, but if I look at either the Alexa or Spotify app on my phone, it thinks it’s playing the right track still.\n\nIt’s not just Spotify though. Audible can’t play back reliably either. Sometimes it’ll just stop playing. Worse, it’ll have forgotten where it left off even when it seems to be working well. It’ll throw off your progress on a book on all your devices thanks to WhisperSync.\n\nMultiRoom audio is easy to set up, but again it doesn’t work reliably. More often than not, one speaker will be playing and the other will be silent until halfway into a track and then it’ll suddenly start, but when the next track comes up it’ll quit playing again.\n\nWhen I tell Alexa to turn on Hue lights, they’ll sometimes quickly scan through all of the scenes before randomly deciding to keep one. It'd work great for a mini 2 second disco party.\n\nHere’s my biggest gripe. Spotify playback can only shuffle 100 tracks away from the point where you start shuffling. So if you go through the trouble of setting up a Routine so you can wake up to music, you’ll find out that even if you tell it to shuffle the playlist, it’ll only play the first 100 tracks in the playlist ever and it will always start on the first one. If you select a track in the middle of a large playlist with an app from Spotify Connect, it’ll play that and the shuffle will only extend 50 tracks away before and after. This is what makes me think most of the troubles are memory limitations, and not software bugs or something wrong with my Wi-Fi.\n\nWhat you can do with Routines is pretty limited. You can’t automate any third party functionality. Just the handful of built in ones designed to work with Routines."},{"reviewerName":"David M.

Yes\n\nHere's why:\nThere are thousands of reviews for this product so I'll keep this brief. I am a self admitted Amazon Echo product nerd. With at least one device of some type in every room of the house (yes including the bathroom). I even echo devices outside so, as you can tell, I am \"all in\" when it comes to the Amazon Echo ecosystem. Recently, I found myself having to repeat the wake word to my first generation Echo Plus multiple time and also started experiencing some smart home weirdness so I decided that it was probably time for an upgrade. Don't get me wrong, my original Echo was still working, and working well, it had just started to show it's age. I ordered this 2nd gen Echo Plus and like everything else, it arrived on time with no issues. Let me tell you, after installing this, I could have kicked myself for waiting so long. The difference is honestly like night and day. Everything and I do mean EVERYTHING is vast improvement over the 1st generation. In the past I've whined about missing the turn top volume control from the original Echo devices, but for some reason, on the echo plus, I didn't miss it at all. I could not have been happier with the way it seamlessly took over the smart home control from whichever devices were still using the 1st generation and not my 2nd gen Echo Show which also has a built in hub. It also seems to issues commands to my smart home devices A LOT faster than my old echo. The voice prompts are so much better. I now can say the wake word once and know that it heard me. Again, I really wish I would have upgraded sooner. As for my old Echo Plus? No, it's not being retired to the old tech graveyard that a lot of us have now (also know as a box in the garage, basement or attic). It's already found a new home in our backyard gazebo :-) If you have a 1st gen Echo Plus or you what to get your feet wet in the smart home world without the expense of a 2nd generation Echo Show, I definitely recommend getting this.

I've been able to play with Echo Dot 2nd Gen, Echo Dot 3rd Gen, Echo 2nd Gen, and this in the same space. The Echo Plus bass is truly impressive for the size, and the only audio complaint I have is wishing its tweeter was a little more powerful. Mid to high-range piano notes, for example, ring louder from my Echo Dot 3rd Gen than from the Echo Plus, but that low vibration that fills the room is definitely dominated by the Echo Plus.\n\nThis thing also comes with an onboard thermometer, which is mostly what sold me. I know it seems like a trivial thing, but I really like the added ability to ask Alexa what the temperature is in that room. I don't know if the Zigbee Smart Home Hub part as been super useful to me. I do use it to control a bulb which was bundled with it, but most of my lights that I use are lamps, which are on smart plugs that work without this protocol anyway.\n\nOverall, I'm super happy to have this nice smart speaker added to my Echo collection.

I'm not all that pleased with the cloth exterior, waiting to see how long that lasts. Amazon has done away with turning the ring on top to increase or decrease volume, now they have buttons to push. Of course, you can always direct Alexa to lower the volume, but I found it easier when I was next to the device to give a quick twist when the phone rang, which was also near the device. Two upgrades I noticed is that Alexa can whisper on this device. Second upgrade feature, with a subscription, you can have all of your devices playing music throughout the house.

The original Echo controlled my Hue lights by interfacing with the Hue hub. When I set up the 2 Gen. Echo, it didn't work well with the Hue hub and refused to recognize and control my lights. I tried a number of things to get it to work with the Hue hub (reset, discover new devices, etc.), but nothing worked. I believe that the built-in Zigbee hub was creating a conflict with the Hue hub. To get the Echo to recognize my Hue lights, I had to remove the Hue hub, reset the Echo and manually enter the serial numbers of each light bulb into the Alexa app. Since then, it's been working fine. However, I lost the ability to update the Hue bulb functionality to remain in the off-state after resuming from a power outage -- something that Philips finally addressed in a software update.\n\nThe 2nd Gen. Echo has a built-in temperature sensor. Initially, it was reasonable accurate. However, it's now measuring as much as 5 degrees below the actual ambient temperature. I haven't found any instructions that would allow the user to recalibrate the sensor. I don't use the Echo to control my heating/cooling system but it would be a big problem if I did.\n\nThe sound quality of the 2nd Gen. Echo is better than my original Echo. I also like that it's smaller in height, so it's a little less intrusive. I miss the volume control on the original Echo that consisted of turning a ring on the top, but the buttons on the 2nd Gen. will suffice.\n\nAll in all, it's a decent product.

Sometimes it doesn't know/understand and they rephrase their question (or simplify their question) and keep trying till they get an answer, other times it answers on the first question. And sometimes it 'hears' something way different than what was asked and the response is not what was expected and hilarious.\n\nRight now there's one thing it does that's annoying the crap out of me. When playing a radio station, it will not stop playing unless I go into the alexa app and turn it off. If I say 'stop playing', 'stop', 'pause', or even tell it to play a song, it pauses for a moment, then continues to play the radio station.\n\nOverall I give it a 3-4 star rating, I would definitely buy these again, and will most likely get the next generation model when it comes out, or shortly after and set these up in another room."},{"reviewerName":"Greg H.","rating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great Device, Terrible Performance/Connectivity Issues","reviewDate":"January 22, 2019","reviewText":"Apparently this is a semi-common issue, but this device drops from the WiFi network. It may go a day, it may go 2 weeks, but eventually, it drops off of WiFi and the reconnection process is awful. It errors out over and over with no troubleshooting or error codes. I've tried 2.4GHz and 5GHz, automatic setup and manual setup, setup via phone app and setup via web browser. I had a Dot with no issues before. The router is literally 6 feet away from the unit. This is a major inconvenience for any smart-enabled appliance or device connected, especially some that are accessed through the hub, such as lights. It makes morning routines, alarm management, and other used functionality absolutely useless as it'll be days before I can reconnect. I'll periodically try again and again and eventually it work for no reason. I am living in an apartment complex with lots of other wifi enabled devices but that should't be an issue. Sometimes rebooting the router works but rebooting every week or two is an inconvenience that is unacceptable.\n\nThat being said, as for the actual product, I'd give a 5/5 if not for the technical issues. I will complain that the unit doesn't seem to hear me as well as advertised. Living in an apartment, I can't be screaming across the place for the Echo to hear me. Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't, especially when it seems like it should (clear line of voice travel, reasonable volume), or it will hear the \"Alexa\" prompt but not the command. The sound quality is pretty good. Definitely not premium but way better than the Dot and good enough fidelity to play music. Clear voice and sounds makes a pleasant experience.

Moving along the set up was fast & easy just use your PC Alexa App and in about 5 Min. its ready to go. I had a 1st Gen. Echo that did a good job and has nice sound and with it I have a few Plugs & bulbs still working good. So... when I seen the new Echo Plus & new subwoofer I had to have them. The Echo Plus did have better sound then my 1st Gen. one. It also connected to everything I've had for a few years. Instead of using the awake word Alexa I changed it to Computer, the 2 other words you can use are Amazon & Echo. Connecting the 2 Echo Pluses to the Amazon Subwoofer went smoothly and now I have the sound I wanted. The music app I have lets me play different combinations of speakers. You also can turn speakers up or down manually or by command. One other \" of many \" thing I like is when I turn off all the lights to go to bed I tell my Echo Plus to turn on my bedroom light, its a multi color bulb which is set on blue. When I get in bed I ask my Echo Dot 3rd Gen. to turn lights off.

Those were my initial goals something that could help me with those basics. I also added plugs to control lamps. It works great for these functions. Setting light timers, adjusting the thermostat, putting down the garage door when I have a lot of groceries and want to keep Sparkles the Wonder Cat from escaping.\n\nThe other main function I got this for was listening to music. The sound is great. Being able to upload your music to Amazon and create custom playlists with music not purchased through Amazon is not an option. If you purchased the music through Amazon you are ok. If not you can't play that music on your Amazon Echo.\n\nFor someone like me who is married to a musician, has an extensive jazz collection that I have compiled over the years (rare CD's I purchased in local record stores and ripped onto my PC), recordings of concerts my friends (who play in various bands) have shared with me, and school concerts of my kids this is not great. Amazon did let you upload music once upon a time but no longer. The only easy workaround is to pair your smartphone/tablet/PC via Bluetooth and use it as a speaker but you can't use voice control that way so it is not a hands-free option.\n\nOn the plus side it has added features, you can now call people from your contacts that you share with Echo using the smartphone app. It has a lot of skills that you can add from the practical like controlling the garage door as mentioned earlier to the fun like having Echo purr and meow for Sparkles the Wonder Cat.\n\nI like the Echo Plus model the best compared to the ones I have owned. This has the best sound followed by 3rd Generation Dot surprising sound for being so small, then 2nd generation Echo and 2nd generation Dot which sounds decent and easily pairs with a Bluetooth speaker. Amazon also has a trade-in program which I used toward the purchase of the Echo Plus.\n\nLove the sound, wish it was easier to integrate music you own that is not purchased through Amazon, the smart functions work well and new features are constantly being added, so my music issues may be addressed and I am looking forward to added features."},{"reviewerName":"William King","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Google is better","reviewDate":"July 17, 2019","reviewText":"Had the Google home, wanted to try the Alexa since my work uses it and I liked it.

I'm an early adopter and bought the 1st Echo and and the 1st Echo Show. I was getting tired of the poor sound quality and figured it was time to upgrade. I spent a long time debating between the Echo and Echo Plus. I wishI hadn't wasted my time with the Echo. It's no contest. The Echo Plus is light years ahead on sound and that's the most important aspect to me as I listen to a lot of music. Alexa doesn't always understand my voice, but I am a Brit and it may be my accent, so I need to cut her some slack on that. (Although it is a bit annoying on times, considering I'm asking the same questions all the time. It's not like we use a full vocabulary with Alexa).\n\nI don't have much experience with the hub. I really didn't buy it for that, but I do have the smart plug that came with the deal I got and that works like a charm. All in all I'm thrilled with my Echo Plus. I'm an Apple Fan and was seriously contemplating the HomePod for music. I'm not saying the Echo Plus is on a par with that, but it is good enough, (with the added benefit that I can use it with Prime Music), that I feel I can live with this for my music."},{"reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Prefer bigger sound and a less difficult Alexa","reviewDate":"February 1, 2019","reviewText":"I originally bought the Echo 2nd Gen but was not pleased with the bass so I exchanged it for the Echo Plus. Note that I did this solely for music; I have no smart devices in my home so I did not buy this to control lights, locks, etc. The sound IS better but it is not the big full sound I am looking for. I determined I definitely want a system with more than one speaker for the stereo effect.\n\nWhat was frustrating to me was dealing with Alexa; there were too many communication problems. My first Alexa knew music that the new one didn't but perhaps that was due to communication as well. Alexa also sometimes talked or started playing music when I did not address her which was a little creepy. Sometimes I would have to get up close to the Echo and speak my words slow-ly-and-dis-tinct-ly for her to understand what I wanted. As a result of these issues combined with wanting a bigger sound I decided to return the Plus.\n\nI am a 67-year-old man trying to catch up on technology and it has been interesting to me to see so many other 'boomers' on here trying to do the same thing. Purchasing the two Echo speakers entered me into this whole Bluetooth-wireless-WiFi world that I knew nothing about, and I have learned a lot.

The previous two are Echo Dots. Our primary use has been streaming our Amazon Music. The sound quality of the second generation Dot is not adequate for our purpose so we use the 1/8\" jack and plug the Dots into stereos. That arrangement works great for playing music, but we do not keep the stereos on 24/7. Thus, we miss out on many of the Echo's available features. The reviews about the sound quality of the 2nd-Gen were mixed, but Amazon incentive discount was enough to make it worth the risk. Glad we took the plunge. At volume 3 the sound fills our living room. While a single Echo does not deliver stereo, we do not miss that for casual listening. When we want stereo we do what we always did and play a Dot through a stereo. Now, we are using many of the additional features of Echo devices. Simple things like controlling lights, checking weather, and using the timer feature when cooking.\n\nCurrently, when using the 1/8\" stereo jack Echo device speakers are disconnected. Understandable in that competing with the stereo speakers is undesirable.

I am having a difficult time holding myself back from buying all the products that can be controlled by Alexa (thermostat, door bell, garage doors, lights, receptacles, fireplace …). My only complaint so far is that Alexa is not as smart as Google or Cortana. Amazon needs to provide Alexa with a more robust search engine.

Local voice control will only work when using the Echo Plus built in hub for everything, and none of my many smart home devices utilise it because it either too basic or incompatible. A complete waste of money and a largely unhelpful feature as it has no real compatibility. False advertising on part of Amazon. It also doesn’t allow for the same functionality to be propagated across the many other echos I have in my house, so they all still chirp irritatingly annoying messages in chorus, but slightly out of sync, saying there is “no internet”, even though the plus thankfully doesn’t join in anymore. Another thing I wish they would let me disable, so I just hear the single red ring hum if the internet is out, and not get screamed at by all my devices when the internet goes it, which is everyday.

In the future, I think it would be wise to showcase a very interesting application and provide it for free. Pick a customer's favorite \"thing\" and either suggest and then pay for its implementation OR suggest something and offer professional installation at highly reduced rates. I think that would go a long ways to help build your services up in the future as internet of things takes off. I also think it would be wise to have a listening mode light on your Alexas's.

This new speaker is in the kitchen near the stove, replacing the prior Dot's that lived in the same spot. The Dot's did not do very well picking up voice - sometimes not at all, and sometime just very wrong.

The speakers just go quiet, but you can still see the song playing on Spotify. I can play on one speaker with no issues, but I got all these devices so I can have music playing throughout my place. This has been going on for about 3 months now and I am done. I thought the first time it happened that Amazon might be having problems, nope. This issue has continued. I've reset every device and restarted my modem and router and still garbage. Oh, but songs from Amazon will play through with no issue on all devices. So this tells me that some 'possible' BS is happening. I have google set up at my ex's house and do not have any of these problems and this is sad. I wanted Alexa to be solid, but I've just had setbacks with these devices. They are nice looking devices, but not worth the problems.\n\nIf you (Amazon) contact me for support, don't tell me that I need to uninstall apps and re-install to fix the problem, that's BS!! I've never had to uninstall Google to get something to work!

So now I have 2 echo pluses, a subwoofer and a dot in my kitchen (also have a tap but use that outside). And when I use the clock while playing music on the echos the dot can't hear me over the music unless I get right next to it.

Had to be sent a replacement. Had to be sent ANOTHER replacement...none of the problems were fixed (systemic to the device) and have just given up. What are the problems? Let me count the ways:\n\n1. The \"Line In\" (the reason I got this; in order to be a speaker for my small bedroom TV). It kept glitching to Line Out for no reason, then for three weeks couldn't be turned back to Line In (making the item unusable as a TV speaker). Turned out it was a software problem, which was eventually fixed...but it still will randomly switch from Line In to Line Out for no reason.\n\n2. With a cable from the TV to the Line In of the Echo Plus, the lag/sync is off. Always. It's infuriating, as there's no way to fix it. Reboots, shut downs, replacement device (which they swore, twice, would fix it), nothing fixes it. I can watch TV, but it's always irritating. Worse, if I use Bluetooth earbuds/headphones to listen, the lag is so far out, it's like watching a badly dubbed foreign film. I've just given up on this.\n\n3. Completely random and total unworkable voice response, or lack thereof. One moment I say \"Alexa, do...\" and it works. A moment later if I try. Nothing. No light to say it's heard me. Nothing. It'll then work for no reason later, or not. It NEVER works first thing in the morning. It's infuriating and makes voice control completely useless as there's never a consistent answer to a voice command since it never responds. I've trained the voice, rebooted, had three of them...it's something specific to the Echo Plus. My Echo Dot is fine. If I sync to my bluetooth earbuds in the morning, that seems to \"wake\" it up...but only for an indeterminate time. It's infuriating.\n\n4. With that in mind, I'm sure people ask: \"Why not just use the Alexa app on your iPhone or iPad to turn on lights/fans/etc.? Ha! To get the app up and connected it takes...wait for it: over a minute at times. Now, my Lumiman light bulbs that I want to turn off/on through Alexa? No hope through their software, but Lumiman's software is instantaneous. Always works. No wait.\n\nI wish I could just get my money back and I'd get a small speaker (I was going to, but thought this would kill two birds with one stone). This has been a totally awful experience and now a waste of money."},{"reviewerName":"D. C.

The microphones are more sensitive than the literature can describe. It can respond effectively to a nearby whisper or pick up a normal tone of voice from roughly 30 feet away. The speaker provides good music fidelity. However, the owners materials do not adequately cover all that Alexa can do. I recommend purchasing a 3rd-party book of your choice to uncover some of the more arcane skills Alexa can possess.

Immediately after the setup, we were disappointed that this new device was not nearly as loud as the Amazon Echo (1st Gen). While the Echo Plus looked terrific and sounded good, it still could not match the original version. We decided to pair the subwoofer with the Echo Plus, and it did help with the bass, but the overall volume was still not the same as the original Echo. Along with the purchase of the Echo Sub Bundle, we also purchased the Echo Remotes for the ease of selecting our music. This turned out to be a nightmare. If you have a subwoofer paired with the Echo Plus, it overrules the paired remote which in turn makes the remote useless until the sub is unpaired from the device. The Echo Plus worked flawlessly with the remote when the sub was unpaired.\n\nSome things are expected to get better as the generations progress but, in my opinion, not in this case. This appears to be one of those \"if it's not broke, don't fix it\" scenarios. Gen 2's and their lack of compatibility within its own genuine Echo add-on devices (sub and remote) makes me question what happened in the Gen 2's.\n\nIf you are looking for a clean sounding Echo without any extras, then this device will work just fine, and the sound is pretty good. If you are like us, hanging out listening to fairly loud music and using the remote so Alexa can hear you, this is not for you when paired with the sub.\n\nI hope this helps.

Very noticeable improvement in sound and voice recognition. While it does not replicate a surround sound system or soundbar (which it doesn't claim to do) it provides better than satisfactory sound with a surprising amount of bass. We listen to all sorts of music through Pandora, Spotify and Amazon and have no complaints with the quality of sound, it gets quite loud and remains crystal clear. When we want the music to extend to our living room, we simply tell it to connect to bluetooth and it automatically turns on our surround sound system and continues the song.\n\nOur Echo lives in the kitchen and functions as a source of music, news, games while we are cleaning, cooking timers and random questions about ingredients. Its convenient to ask Alexa to turn on the under cabinet lights when your hands are dirty and you need a little extra light to see what you are doing. Its also convenient to ask her to turn the A/C lower when it starts getting hot in the kitchen.\n\nAs far as connectibility with smart home devices, it was easily recognized through our Alexa app and took zero updates or syncing to get our Hue lights, smart thermostat and sound system working with voice control. If you don't already own an Alexa device, it will take a little bit of setup.\n\nWe are thoroughly happy with the purchase and continue to recommend to friends and family.

I'm already the owner of a couple of Echo Dots. I have one paired with a Samsung sound bar in my living room. I had the other connected to a Vaux speaker in my bedroom. I was fine. I didn't need to buy the Echo Plus. Or so I thought.Yesterday, my girlfriend bribed me to go shopping with her at an outlet mall by telling me I could have free reign in the Bose store located there. I was pretty impressed by the Bose Home 500. Great bass. Exceptional stereo separation. Very large price tag—even the factory referbished model which I was considering buying. Ultimately, the price tag, as well as some unresolved questions I had concerning compatibility with other devices caused me not to purchase the Bose speaker. But it did get me to thinking. Could I get more premium sound in my bedroom? Could I get better sound out of my Amazon Fire enabled TV?Initially, I planned to buy the Echo Plus directly from Amazon, but I elected to buy it from Best Buy, because I would've had to wait for three days for Amazon to ship it to me. We do live in an age of instant gratification, don't we?I got the tiny Amazon Plus home, unboxed it, and had basic setup completed within two minutes. Following that, I paired it with my Amazon Fire enabled TV, and I started putting the speaker through its paces.Overall, the sound quality is very good. Not exceptional, but very good. The bass is punchy and loud. The stereo separation is underwhelming, but the quality itself almost makes up for that. With a little tweaking of the bass, mid, and trebble settings, I was able to get the speaker to sound more than acceptable at all volume levelsAfter playing with the TV a bit, the next task was to add the speaker to my media groups. Nothing could ever have been simpler. I then set about pairing the Plus with my outdoor speakers—a pair of Sound Appeals which I also bought from Amazon. Again, almost too easy. Then I paired the Plus with the water proof bluetooth speaker I use in my shower. Easy again. Best of all: The plus automatically connects to the TV and the additional speakers whenever I turn them on.My next task will be to pair the device with the free smart bulb I received with my purchase. I anticipate no problems.Bottom line: Great sound and easy and versatile connectivity for a great price.

The echoes themselves are “fine” at absolute best and an incredible annoyance at worst. Most of the time they are just a source of frustration. They often become unavailable for no apparent reason and disconnect from devices on their own often. I had a sub pair hooked up for my main room to listen to music and I would say I had a <50% success rate of getting it to play music when I wanted it to. Alexa has a hard time recognizing my voice (it seems one echo is much better at it than the other, despite being set up in the same manner) and it’s just not very intuitive which I thought was a big selling point for these products. Set up was a hassle, keeping them working was a hassle, sure the sound quality was fine, but not worth the wrestling match of getting it to finally play correctly. I debated between getting this set up (2 echo plus + sub) or starting with Sonos or the Apple HomePod, and at this point, I can confidently say the Amazon Alexa route was in fact the wrong decision. I am sure amazon won’t let me return them now, so I am going to work on selling them second hand or some sort of swap out. Very unhappy with this purchase, would not recommend to anyone. For context, I’m your average late 20s person who considers himself to have above average tech savvy and I had a difficult time with it. Look elsewhere for your music options."},{"reviewerName":"HS Tulsa","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Its not broken its calibrating with little info","reviewDate":"February 14, 2019","reviewText":"Due to a software design issue I initially thought it was defective. I found nothing to indicate that not being able to access its setting while the thermostat calibrated was normal, I thought it didn’t setup correctly. It was not defective after several hours I could see the settings and it works as well as all other echos. I assumed that I would have an easy process to move zigbee devices from my old plus to the new one like a one click transfer in the app, but no it’s no easy or simple to move zigbee device. So I left them on the old plus so this wasn’t the easy upgrade I expected it to be. I just didn’t move the zigbee devices.

I think my main issue is that regardless of where I place this speaker it doesn't wake/activate as well as my older previous.

The sound is decent (although overpriced) for what it is. It really needs decent bass, however, the Amazon \"sub\" is a terrible option (it's really a midrange speaker trying to push low end sound). Unless you're playing pop/dance music the sound becomes muddy. There's about a one or two second delay between the speakers when giving a command. In other words, the Echo Plus that is closest to you will listen to your command while the other Echo and Sub will continue playing music for a second or two.

What I came to find out is that Amazon does not offer price match on items purchased. I spoke to a rep on the chat line and they said, while they don't price match, you can return the Echo and order a new one at the lower price. This is ridiculous... Amazon basically pays for twice the shipping (returning the old unit and shipping the new one), rather than a simple adjustment to the payment method that was originally tendered.

Th sound quality of the Echo Plus is OK, especially when configured into a stereo pair, but just OK and definitely bellow the quality of my built in system powered by a Sony A/V receiver. I could probably live with the sound quality for ambient music, but the real deal killer is that in multi speaker WiFi mode the Echo can only be paired to ONE Spotify account. This is a huge gap since my wife, daughter and I all have our own accounts, music tastes and stored playlists. I am going to try the Sonos Play:1 and see if that provides a better experience.

Last example: I have not figured this one out yet but the Alexa app has a bug that has actually reactivated Amazon Music after I stopped playing music and had closed the app. This became a problem when after closing Amazon Music and trying to play Pandora, Alexa jumped back in (even though it was closed) and restarted Amazon Music and didn’t let me stream Pandora from the same iPad.\n\nI’ve had two Echo Plusses replaced - and this was recommended by an Amazon service person who said it was a software glitch.\n\nLast note: the new units worked perfectly for 4 weeks then started doing the same thing; however, 10 days later they were perfect again and are still working great.

It was so easy to set up for the most part. I plugged it in and in a few short minutes, it was online ready to play! The sound for its small size was awesome~! I wouldn't think one would want much more than that right? I purchased this unit since I wanted Alexa to speak the indoor temperature. I tried saying or doing a number of things but the indoor temperature eluded me. I imagined having a device which wouldn't need outdoor wired or wireless probes with batteries. I would already have accurate outdoor temperature info as well as the indoor temperature and no need for probes of any kind. I think I spent hours trying to get the indoor temperature to speak with Alexa. I could go into the Alexa App select the echo plus and read the indoor temperature through my phone, So why couldn't she speak the indoor temperature! I learned later that a sensor had to be activated. It's a shame that Alexa couldn't have activated the Sensor. An Amazon help person tried to tell me what I needed to find but I think I was dealing with graphics. I am totally blind and use voiceover on my IPhone. I couldn't find the sensor or anything else to activate the indoor temperature so it would speak. I watched some youtube videos but none of these helped. Perhaps I'll approach disability services to see if they know of a solution to this! I deregistered the echo plus from my account and put it back in the box. If I can't find any solution for finding the sensor and turning on the indoor temperature, the echo plus is heading back to Amazon. I'll stay with my tried and true echos.\n\nJim\n\nI am happy to say that I didn’t send my Echo plus back after all! I removed it from its box before registering to my account again! At first, I couldn’t see the indoor temperature on my phone. I planned to call disability services.

I said, echo, temperature inside! She spoke it to my relief! I also said, Echo, inside temperature. She repeated it again! I was pleased! Something may not have been right in the first registration or I wasn’t giving her the right verbage! I don’t know what happened for certain! I didn’t have to activate anything! It worked right away!

When I first bought my echo plus speakers, things were great. About 2-3 days later, I linked my speakers together and gave Alexa a command to stop playing the music. She hesitated, but followed through. About a week later when I gave Alexa a command to end the music, she hesitated and then kept playing the music. Um, hello, who’s in charge here?

Given my success with the Dot, I thought I'd try installing the Echo Plus as my primary device for most of my household tech, and moving the Dot into the bedroom.\n\nI was a little worried I'd have to reprogram everything to link it to the Echo Plus instead of the Dot, but it turned out to be a completely seamless process. My wall clock, Logitech and Philips Hue hubs all integrated perfectly with the new device, which offers much better sound quality as a bonus, and the Dot was perfect in the bedroom.\n\nThe Echo system isn't yet perfect, but new skills are being added all the time, and despite my initial skepticism I'm eager to see how it develops."},{"reviewerName":"Brian P.","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"EXCELLENT","reviewDate":"November 28, 2018","reviewText":"Love this speaker. I am very picky about sound quality which kept me from buying the first gen Echo. I thought the sound was too tinny. The Echo Plus sound is REALLY GOOD with nice bass and sound balance. Aesthetically pleasing also and the mic is very sensitive, picking up my voice easily even to almost a whisper. It's not a Bose, of course but for a portable speaker this is REALLY good. I may get 2-4 more for the rest of the house.\n\nFor those of you worried about smart home privacy, the Echo will not unlock doors or disarm a system. Lock / arm only which I appreciate.\n\nThe only thing I wish it had is a rechargeable battery so I could take it anywhere in the house more easily but for now I'll deal with the plug. Hope the 3rd gen comes with a battery.

After having her for months, I wouldn’t recommend her to anyone. Below are my pros and cons:\n\nPros- (1) Great speaker, (2) compatible with many devices, and (3) Alexa is easier to use and smarter than Siri.\n\nCons- (1) Doesn’t work well all the time. I have to repeat myself or reword commands. (2) Alexa’s abilities do not come already enabled. For example you want to play a game, you have to enable it on your app. (3) Compatibility with Hue lights isn’t the best. When asked to turn on “kitchen lights,” sometimes she will only turn 1 of 2 on. This sometimes requires you to reconnect the lights on your app.\n\nIn the end, Alexa is cool to have but not worth the money."},{"reviewerName":"Matthew Henry","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Trash","reviewDate":"August 17, 2019","reviewText":"Wrote this review already for the echo dots and not usually a reviewer but I feel the need to steer people away from these so here is my review for all alexa devices. This thing is a straight up dumpster fire. Worked fine for a few weeks but now it wont play music. Repeatedly says it cant connect to internet and no matter what you tell it to play, it plays something different. In app connection trying to resolve issues is just as worthless. Attempting to play music from the app always comes back \"unavailable at this time\" and the voice recognition is shotty as best.

I cannot stand having to yell at this thing. It's turned into a hostile relationship. Try asking it to read something and you'll get an offer for a free audible trial, and then you have to yell to interrupt it while it's giving you the rundown. I've tried saying, \"Alexa, do not ever use the Audible skill,\" but no use. At least once a week it happens again. And if I walk into the room with my laptop then Alexa announces that I'm connected, and when I leave the room it announces that I'm disconnected. It's really annoying. I do not like this voice control.\n\nOk, this section is new. I decided not to edit my original complaints but to add to them instead. I got a call from a friendly Amazon guy today who told me that there is, indeed, an Alexa app for my phone. And he even walked me through the app and showed me where to change the volume, select from my radio station history or from new stations, and a number of other things. I was familiar with the Alexa app on my laptop and it did not have any of these features, and I assumed the two apps were similar, but not so. (You know what they say about assuming.) Anyway, the guy was very helpful and I've since apologized to Alexa for my recent verbal abuse. Bottom line, this really is a good product. My two sons want one now.

I contacted customer service again after the weekend and kept getting the run around. They ask if I wanted a refund and I said no, I want a replacement so I can get the sale price.

Alexa comes with a Phillip's Hue Smart LED standard bulb, which can be used in your living room for table lamps. If your lamp is a pedestal Wall Dimming Lamp using a non-standard bulb, the other option would be to use a smart plug outlet connected to the Wall Lamp, all controlled by talking to Alexa, \"Alexa, turn off/on 1st/2nd lamp or \"Alexa, turn off/on wall lamp\" and programming Alexa using the Alexa Smartphone App to do all that plus control your Smart TV and Verizon FiOS automatically to turn on and select the channel you want to see, like saying to Alexa, \"Alexa, Change to channel ABC\", which turns on your FiOS Video Media Server and Smart Wifi HDTV at the same time, to channel 7, or pause live TV and play TV again by enabling skills to your Alexa APP which are subroutines within the Alexa APP, such as the FiOS skill, and other skills like Samsung Smartthings. However the FiOS skill cannot turn off your FiOS VMS but you can close your WIFI HDTV, using Smartthings skill which I think in the future the updated Alexa APP might contain an updated FiOS skill to turn off your TV as well at the same time.

We love to sit with the TV OFF and tell Alexa any of the songs we remember from the past!! We try to remmember some of the songs from when we were dating 55 years ago and she KNOWS them!!! Alexa is very entertaining. Our grandkids love it. Great sound. MOST of the time it works great. I’m not sure yet why sometimes it loses it’s internet connection. Could be Soectrum, Alexa, or wireless router. Loses connection, but a little while later is fine. Needs a little tweeking for normal seniors to be able to hook up with the app on smart phone. Keep at it and you will get it. So many uses for all kinds of information.

Those that have followed these devices over the past year or two know that the latest Echo Plus is now shorter, a little wider and comes with a 33% improvement in tweeter speaker size and a 20% size improvement with the woofer. Those and other improvements you can read about in their literature make for a better sounding product. If you enjoy music, the Plus is the best Echo product to buy.\n\nI have also taken full advantage that the hub feature provides by having sound on all devises at the same time playing one of the fifty playlists I've created on Amazon Music. Also every room in the house has a smart bulb that Alexa can turn on or off individually or collectively or you can use the Amazon Alexa app. It also controls the smart plugs we have.

My kids did it because I didn't think we had much use for it. I am not totally blind, I can still drive during the daytime, but I do have issues here and there. Let me tell ya, as an old 0311, I don't trust anyone who is not a Marine Grunt or a Cop in the Air Force, (I only did the cop thing with the awesome 944th SFS at Luke AFB, because they gave me an M-60 and free pointy things to go with it) and I hate anything that is intrusive or could compromise my OPSEC .

I honestly would have never bought one because I really have no use for it. BUT since I have one now :) I think it's pretty neato. AI still has a long way to go and so does Alexa. Its always listening. Always. I have it next to my TV. When Amazon commercials play maybe ONCE in a blue moon it will recognize \"alexa do so and so\" and will turn on, rings go violently around in a circle and wont perform the task. So its genuinely okay to have it next to a TV that is relatively loud. My TV is a 55\" LG. Over all it's a neato product but honestly not practical unless you like to say order this and that. BUT still have to go on the app or site to complete transaction. It also normally puts Amazon brand items in your cart FYI. It's good for music, or asking silly questions, and other facts it can tell you. I rarely use it. But you can also use it on your phone to \"drop in\" and talk/ listen to everyone going on in the area where it's placed. It can keep you entertained for a little while. But quickly becoming boring.

We always have music playing while my wife and I are cooking or relaxing in our garage or really just about anything going on at the house. I did get two echo dots to pair with this plus. The ability to pair all three and have the multi room experience is a huge game changer. The plus has amazing highs and bass response. With the dots paired, the sound is so rich. We did get a free trial for amazon music and after using it the past week, I have cancelled my Pandora and keeping the amazon music. We can hear a considerable difference in sound quality. The library is endless. My family definitely gives this a high 5 star rating.\n\nWe do have 2 Bose speakers that we would use and always fighting for which phone is connected. Which is why I got the idea of getting these speakers. No need to fight over Bluetooth connects anymore. The price point is spot on and very good quality. I am considering getting the amazon subwoofer but the boss at home said not now.\n\nI’ve never owned any products with Alexa and she has surprised us in a great way. Alexa is so fun and the routines I’ve set up are always great. My kids love the stories and jokes she tells.\n\nAll in all, I recommend the plus and follow up with a couple of dots to add that extra enjoyment. It’s sound quality is amazing sealed up in a compact design. The cloth exterior adds a classy touch to our kitchen and bedroom.\n\nIf someone can find a way to make these portable, that would definitely be a huge deal at our house.

She would tell Alexa to play her favorite songs and would dance to her songs. That was then and this is now. It is amazing how far along the Amazon Alexa has come. Now you can use it to set up your smart home devices, make calls, send messages, send announcements and even use Alexa to show you your DIY home security cameras. This is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of all the items Alexa can do. When I hear about people making a fuss about people from Amazon listening to their Elexa comments, I thank Amazon for hiring all those employees helping to make Elexa continuously better. There are so many things that you can do with the New Amazon Alexa, that I can spend hours and hours learning the features available within the Alexa app. If I had a nickel for all the times my wife has told me to stop using my phone or tablet, which then keeps me from learning and doing more things within the Alexa app, I would have accumulated enough nickles to buy ten Echos. Thank you, Amazon for all the work that you have done to make the Amazon Alexa as amazing that it is.

I mostly shop on amazon so it was an easy choice for me. The voice recognition is almost perfect still a few times when I have to speak up but only when I have my room fan on so maybe it’s my fault for drowning out my voice. I would say 99/100 times Alexa does hear me perfectly so it’s not a problem. The sound quality of the speaker is amazing. The simple iOS app for Alexa to sort and rename devices is painless to use and has practically no learning curve. I have a room with a small hallway and sink connecting to my bathroom, Alexa has no problem turning lights on and off from any of the rooms. I absolutely love the way prime music and Spotify works with her. I’m glad I went with the echo plus because it has a built in hub unlike the echo dot.

Not only was the set up super easy but Alexa is so helpful! I am not sure how we managed to keep anything straight before getting this! I have used the Echo Plus for multiple things from creating and adding items to a shopping list to playing music while cleaning and all of this completely hands free. No more paper shopping list that gets lost and no more searching YouTube for a song that I want to hear. I simply say \"Alexa, add milk to my shopping list.\" Or, \"Alexa, play today's hits.\" The best feature is the hands free knowledge that is just a question away. While making sugar cookies I needed a conversion for a measurement and my hands were covered in dough and flour. I simply asked Alexa for the conversion and had my answer without needing to stop, wash my hands, and use my phone or cookbook to look up the information I needed. I was also able to set my timer for the cookies by simply asking Alexa to set a timer for 8 minutes. A timer alarm on the Echo Plus alerted me when to remove the cookies from the oven. The Echo Plus links to my iPad and several wireless speakers throughout our house. Linking the Echo Plus with these items was a breeze by using Bluetooth and only took a few seconds for the Echo Plus to find.

So, I obviously love this product. I have them controlling my lights, door camera, space heaters, etc.\n\nThe only complaint I have is the lack of volume control. Using the app, you can set the volume to 15%, but in reality it gets set to \"volume 1\". There are 10 volume settings when you use the verbal commands, but 100 settings in the app using percentages. This is only an issue because at night, playing \"white noise\" or \"thunder storms\", volume 1 is to soft and volume 2 is to loud. It would be awesome if they would let us set the verbal volume to 15%, or at least stop changing the app setting of 15% back to \"volume 1\".

I find myself using the bot more often than I thought I would. She knows extracto who is talking and will base her answers on that. Her speaker is so perfect and the Bluetooth is spot on. Sometimes she’ll lag but that really depends on how fast your WiFi is. Make sure your devices have built in hub! That’s a biggie! The only down side to alexa would have to be is knowing how to ask her questions accurately. If you have a question try and keep it short and simple. But that’s about it.

There are some things it cannot answer, but it is getting upgraded periodically and you have to make sure you speak clearly. The only reason for giving it a 4 star is because I'm having an issue with it communicating with my Directv receiver. Keeps telling me \"I'm having trouble communicating with Directv.

I originally got my Echo + for playing music, but slowly discovered that she could do much more, but wish that Amazon would have a better way to discover all the features. Alexa could use improvement on the voice recognition (you have to speak clearly or she goes on the wrong path) but overall she is great. The sound is fine when playing music, but I left for a business trip and a week later she had forgotten my music, so I had to teach her all over again...

I would have paid 60-70 bucks for the speaker alone. Pair that with Amazon Alexa, and a built in Zigbee hub? This device is an amazing value for what you get. Once they get the subwoofer sorted with working for content that isn't streamed and with the fire tv, I'm buying another one or two and a sub or two.\n\nI should probably add, within a week of owning this my girlfriend bought two echo dots to put around our house.

She loves the voice interaction and the paired stereo sound quality is very good. The only negative we have to say about the Echo is the delay in volume level changes. Which is why we gave the sound quality a 4 instead of a 5.

The problem comes when the internet is lost, even for a short time.\nWhile my echo dot automatically reconnects when the internet is restored, the plus will not. I am forced to constantly reset it and reboot the modem until it finally reconnects. Sometimes this process takes hours because I have to repeat the connection process over and over until it finally decides to connect.\nPerhaps my echo plus is defective. If so, I have no problem getting a replacement, but I need to be certain it is truly defective and not a quirk of the plus.\n\n5 stars when it's connected and functioning. 1 star because it won't automatically reconnect like my echo dot does and it's a nightmare to manually reconnect.\n\nAs is usually the case, amazon tech support is non-existent.\n\nUPDATE: I was actually contacted by someone from Amazon Tech Support. They sent me a replacement Echo Plus that remedied this connectivity problem when the internet is lost for a while. However, this replacement Echo Plus will not recognize any of my lights, even the bulb that came with the device. I've tried everything from rediscovery to the paper clip reset then doing a discovery. The old Echo Plus discovers and operates the lights perfectly.\n\nInterestingly, the new Echo Plus will operates the lights but only if the old Echo Plus is also plugged in (in a different room). Pull the plug on the old Echo and the new Echo suddenly doesn't recognize any of the lights. I'm at a loss as what to do now. I've got to send one of these Echo's back soon or I'll be charged for it.\n\nTiresome."},{"reviewerName":"Amy","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Alexa!","reviewDate":"January 15, 2019","reviewText":"Alexa is so helpful.
