Seriously, it's the top post in Home Theater on the Sonos furms. The Beam suffers from a .4s audio lag behind the video when playing Dolby Digital audio. It's heavily noticeable. The beam simply doesn't work with LG OLEDs and/or certain Sony TV's. This is a HUGE caveat and hopefully people read before buying.\n\nIMO, Sonos rushed this product to market. They make great music speakers but aren’t ready for TV speakers. Incompatibilities with top brand TV’s is pretty unreal in this day and age. Especially for a high end product like this.\n\nThe other issue I have is codec support. Sonos has DD support and literally nothing else. It’s really pathetic. Every other sound bar manufacturer has more than 1 codec support. Dts, Vision, atmos, DD+ should all be supported these days. All of them are heavily used in industry.\n\nThe current solution according to the Sonos forums is buying additional aftermarket equipment (an hdmi optical splitter $50) and completely bypassing the LG OLED. This fixes the lag issue but then it completely breaks Netflix and Amazon Prime Videos which uses DD+ for their high end videos. Everyone watches Netflix these days but guess what Sonos doesn’t support DD+ and since you’re now bypassing the TV it wont convert the DD+ to DD and u get no sound or u have to go into the settings every single time u play something and change it to stereo. This solution also removes ARC and CEC support one of the biggest selling points of the Beam.\n\nThe other solution I see around is forcing to PCM which is stupid cuz you lose Dolby digital altogether and just bought a 400 speaker that now only supports stereo which u can likely get for less than a hundred dollars.\n\nThe speaker sound is great but the # of compatibility issues and workarounds needed to get this to work is absolutely insane.\n\nPeople say it’s not rocket science. But I’m literally a NASA rocket scientist and even I can’t get this to work properly. I really hope people read this comment before purchasing. I wish i had known a lot of these issues beforehand."},{"reviewerName":"wownstuff","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great speaker! +Reuse old subwoofer tip!","reviewDate":"August 4, 2018","reviewText":"I replaced my legacy Paradigm speaker system and Yamaha receiver that originally cost $$$ with the Sonos Beam and two Sonos Play:1s. I couldn't be happier! I'm using it with an LG oled55b7p (shown in my photo).\n\nAudio: It sounds great! The late night setting (voice boost and lower loud noises) is very helpful. The native Apple Airplay streaming without the need for the Sonos app (it allows streaming collectively to the Play:1s also) is a great bonus also.\n\nAlexa: For those of you wondering, if you do not wish to integrate with Alexa you just skip that part in the setup and the microphone is never connected.\n\nReuse your old non-Sonos subwoofer tip!!\nI get that the Sonos ecosystem just works and they want you to buy their subwoofer and thus they have no subwoofer out jack (you need to use their wireless sub). However, if you already have an existing sub woofer, like I do, it's a shame to waste it. I've come up with a great solution. Since the Beam uses HDMI for its audio your TV likely has a free optical out port. Using the optical out port connect a 5.1 Audio Sound Decoder Converter to 5.1CH Analog Audio (6RCA Output). I used this one here: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MS0973G All you need to do is connect your RCA cable to subwoofer connection on the box and you have bass for under $50!"},{"reviewerName":"Gadget freak in SF","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great full sound quality for a really compact speaker","reviewDate":"August 7, 2018","reviewText":"First, being a professional music with very picky ears, I have to say that Sonos REALLY knows how to make a good sounding speaker. Yes, they're pricey, but you really get what you pay for. I had already purchased two Sonos One speakers for music and loved them. For my TV sound I had a full 5.1 system with AV receiver, subwoofer, front and rear, center speakers. LOTS of stuff taking up LOTS of space. The sound was fantastic, but I have a small condo and it was way too much for the space. I was able to eliminate everything with this little Beam speaker. I paired it with with my two Sonos One speakers and the surround sound is almost as good as my full 5.1 previous system. I am THRILLED with the change.\n\nNo, the bass isn't as full as it was on my huge Velodyne 12\" subwoofer, but it's certainly good enough for my room. I get a nice surround separation with the two Sonos One speakers placed a good distance to my left and right in corners of the room.\n\nOne KEY thing I also learned was that in the Sonos settings, you can adjust the room settings so that the TV and Music use the speakers differently. When I played music after adding the Beam, it used the same surround separation as the TV, the default setting. I really missed the full deep music sound I used to have when I just had the two Sonos Ones, since the TV sound automatically puts most of the focus on the Beam front speaker. I stumbled across the room adjustment \"Ambient\" surround setting when you can adjust it for TV and Music separately. I adjusted the balance for Music so it it would come mostly from the Sonos One speakers again. Eureka!! Big full beautiful music sound again. The speakers know when I play the TV, to use the full surround, but when I put music on, it uses the Music setting for more Sonos One use. LOVE IT!!\n\nI can't say enough about how fantastic these speakers sound. I LOVE how little space they take but how BIG and full the sound is. Highly recommended!"},{"reviewerName":"Charles Greenberg","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Do not buy the beam","reviewDate":"The manufacturer commented on the review below","reviewText":"This is the most frustrating piece of crap I’ve ever owned. The Sonos beam. Two techs and myself spent two hours including 3 calls to customer support. Finally sound thru the speakers. Connections were good..HDMI arc. Turned the TV off and the speakers stopped working. Power was on and everything was connected. Cost $300 for installation and it never worked right. Angry and frustrated."},{"reviewerName":"Jose","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Best Soundbar for the Money!","reviewDate":"July 17, 2018","reviewText":"This is my second soundbar that I’ve owned and my first Sonos product. I must say I am very impressed. For such a small soundbar this thing outputs great sound. The Beam’s sound when playing movies and music is perfect. I have a mid-size living room area and the Beam fills the space with sound quite handedly. I do plan on getting the Sonos SUB at some point but after using the Beam all day I’m confident that I can hold out on the SUB until Black Friday.\n\nThe addition of Alexa is arguably this soundbar’s biggest selling point and I’m happy to say it works really well. It works just as well as my Echo and Echo Dot and allows me to control my Smart Home devices. I can ask Alexa to play music on Spotify and then ask it to run my Robovac without having to lift a finger. My personal favorite feature is HDMI-ARC which allows you to do things like control the volume of the soundbar with the TV remote or turn on/off the TV with Alexa. If you’re looking for a soundbar with great sound and great smart features, I highly recommend getting the Sonos Beam!"},{"reviewerName":"Imran","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"New SONOS fanboy","reviewDate":"July 27, 2018","reviewText":"This is my first SONOS purchase ever, and I'm glad I made that decision.\n\nHere's some background: I have a fairly large living room in my new house and it is already hard wired for surround sound, so I was tempted to get a receiver and wired 5.1 setup (which sure sounds great), but I kept reading into wireless surround systems and every review I read or video I saw, SONOS stood out as one of the best with wireless sound. I decided to go with SONOS and do a 5.1 setup with SONOS phase by phase (it is an expensive product) and start off with just the soundbar and then slowly add a sub and satellites. Hence came the next debate - Playbar, Playbase or wait for upcoming Beam\n\nHere's why I went for Beam:\n1. Alexa, Airplay and upcoming Google Assistant integration all in one is a game changer. I'm an Apple Music subscriber, but just being able to use Alexa for turning the TV on or off and skip tracks or change volume is very convenient. Then I can send music to the Beam from any of my apple devices on Airplay. I don't need a HomePod in my living room at all and I don't need a separate sound bar either. I killed 2 birds with one stone.\n2. This thing sounds incredible. As I stated I have a living room bigger than a medium sized living room and it has high ceiling (2 floor high). And the kitchen+breakfast area is open making it one huge family room. I set up Beam and did TruPlay tuning right away. The results are fantastic. The audio fills the entire space and even at half the volume, the music is incredibly good. Did not expect such bass from the little thing but it's good enough to make me debate about buying a $700 sub. After adding 2 play ones as satellites, the setup will sounds incredible.\n3. No need to worry about any audio/video proprietary formats you are playing. Everything that's playing a sound on your TV will be audible through the SONOS and you just need one remote controller."},{"reviewerName":"M. Erb","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Very competent soundbar that is further enhanced by AirPlay2 integration","reviewDate":"August 2, 2018","reviewText":" This is a review of the Sonos Beam.\n\nPrevious to getting the Beam, I had a Samsung HW-FM45C 2.1 Soundbar. It had great sound and bass was excellent because it had a wireless and separate sub-woofer module. The sub-woofer is what really made this a standout soundbar for me and also the thing that I hated the most about it because it was just one more piece of equipment that had to fit somewhere in my room. A strength of the Samsung soundbar was that not only did it have an optical input, Bluetooth connectivity which I used all the time. But we moved and in the process of moving and dismantling everything, I never hooked the soundbar up in our new condo.\n\nTime passes... I purchased 4 Sonos One speakers in December 2017. I was and still am frustrated that there are no line-Ins for the speaker because having a line-in would have enabled me to use these with my HDTV without having to order still more Sonos components to allow such a hookup. And of course, there is no Bluetooth with the Sonos One. They are WiFi, using either your router or their own mesh network for connectivity.\n\nIn a recent development, Sonos made it possible for my Sonos One to use AirPlay2. This somewhat mitigated the issue that the lack of line-in created since using AirPlay2, I was now able to stream music and other sound (YouTube videos for instance) to my Sonos One speakers. The Beam is also able to use Airplay2. Most of the time I do not notice any lag while watching streaming movies from Netflix or YouTube. I do have significant lag when playing back screencasts in Screenflow v8 (for Mac.) We're talking major lag of maybe 2.5 seconds. I don't understand why there is such significant lag. MP4's that I play from my laptop suffer no lag. It might just be something about Screenflow that is causing the lag because in all other situations so far, there is no lag.\n\nI made the decision that maybe the Beam would be a good choice for me as far as my HDTV sound was concerned. It would play nice with my other Sonos One speakers it would not only be a soundbar for my HDTV, but I could also use it just like a Sonos One speaker with the added bonus that it is a stereo speaker, not a mono speaker like a single Sonos One. The other big benefit is that has Alexa built-in and I love using Alexa for Spotify music streaming.\n\nSo I got the Beam. Hooking it up was easy. The Sonos app walks you through the entire process and it took just a few minutes before it was connected and working.\n\nSince I got the speaker the day it was released, I had to hope that the sound would be satisfactory and at least as good as the Sonos One. There weren't many reviews to read prior to my actually getting the Beam, so I just took a chance with it. Happily, the sound is as good as I was expecting and I'm quite happy with the soundbar.\n\nI was hoping for sound that would be very close to the Sonos One. It is and actually better since it is a stereo speaker. Two paired Sonos One speakers provide more full sound than the Beam and the stereo imaging (soundstage) is something that can be adjusted depending on how far apart each Sonos One is from each other. However, the Beam has a decent soundstage particularly considering that you will be generally seated in front of it, a set distance, more or less, from your HDTV.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I am largely quite happy with this soundbar. I believe that the sound you get from two Sonos One speakers is superior to the sound from a single Beam. But you can't simply connect two Sonos One speakers to your HDTV. It's great to have Alexa integration and it's also great that because it is Sonos, it integrates with the other Sonos speakers I own.\n\nAny other misgivings I might have are not specific to the Beam but to the limitations that Sonos places by not including Aux In, Bluetooth, etc. and limitations to Alexa integration which is the fault of Amazon, not Sonos. What's cool though is that if you have numerous Alexa capable Sonos speakers grouped together, you can speak to Alexa on one of them and only that one particular speaker will play Alexa's response.\n\nFinal thought is that if you don't think of this as a soundbar strictly for use with a HDTV you might be thrilled to discover that you can have a great sounding stereo speaker that is sleek, well-built and can be placed in places you might not immediately consider such as the top of a hutch or possibly mounted up high on a wall. The possibilities are intriguing."},{"reviewerName":"SMB","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great in a 5.1, 5.0 or 3.1 Setup","reviewDate":"July 28, 2018","reviewText":"I had a Sony receiver with the Polk RM6750 compact speakers and subwoofer which sounded great but I’ve been looking for a soundbar for a few years now for simplicity and visual appeal. I purchased a Sony HT-ST5000 shortly after its release and ended up returning it a couple days later. The dialogue was particularly awful and the lack of surround channels really made it flat sounding.\n\nI was originally disappointed that Sonos released a small soundbar instead of a “playbar 2” but decided to try out the Beam with Sub and two One’s after many 3rd party review sites ranked the Beam especially high.\n\nIt sounds excellent. Together, it sounds just as good and even better than my previous wired system. Movies and music both shine on this. The Beam itself sounds full and produces a wide sound stage although it’s important to note that it produces little bass so I would not use the Beam by itself unless its on a secondary TV in a very small room. Add the One’s and you get much better bass. Add the sub and you get rumbling thunder. If you can only get one, I’d say get the two One’s so you also get the surround. Note: I’m using the system primarily in a 10x12 ft living room but it will easily fill my 700 sqft apartment with music. Dialogue in movies is always very clear and sounds full. I do not use the dialogue enhancer either - no need for it. Night mode works well but I’ll probably never use that.\n\nAlexa works well. The microphones can hear me speak in a low tone from 20 ft away in my kitchen around around a corner which was surprising.\n\nBig fan of the app. You can adjust all of the speaker levels or turn on enhancements there. You can play iPad music through it. I just wish you could ask Alexa to play XYZ from the iPad like you can with the other music services. You first have to start playing from the iPad in the app and then you can tell Alexa to pause/play or skip the song.\n\nI think I’ve been experiencing some audio delay with XBox One X Blu Rays only... I think because its very slight and only noticed in a C movie and then a movie primarily with CGI so I can’t trust either one. But there is no delay when streaming from apps on the XBox, apps from my TV or my FIOS cable box. The Xbox and cable box are both routed separately through my x900e then HDMI to the Beam. Need some more Netflix DVDs to come in to further test that.\n\nIts nice being able to adjust the volume of the system using Alexa or your TV remote.\n\nAll in all - loving the system. Was thinking I’d replace the Beam when Sonos does release a playbar 2 in the following years but there’s really no need. I’m very happy with it. I’d suggest it if you can get it along with two Ones, the sub or most definitely both - alone though, it lacks bass needed for movies and music.\n\nUpdate: 7-31 - I watched another Blu ray on the xbox and there wasn’t a perceivable audio delay on that one...\n\nUpdate: 8-29 - Experienced more audio delay on Blurays through the XBox. Bought a new Bluray player - no audio delay so far. I'm wondering if it was only DTS movies that the Xbox had to convert to Dolby. No converter on the new player tho."},{"reviewerName":"McB","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"will not work with LG OLED","reviewDate":"December 8, 2018","reviewText":"I spent an hour with tech support with LG and anothr 1.5 hrs with Sonos tech support before reading a review on Amazon that they do not work together.

I just like sounds to sound good to my ears. My use case is all streaming content from my AppleTV to a 43\" Sony Bravia.

Hulu - only broadcast in stereo - so the quality is still good, but only through the Beam. No surround, no sub. That's all on Hulu from what I've read.\n\nI had thought of just starting with the Beam, but after a day of use, I'm happy I chose to get a Sub and the Play 1's.

I have 13 speakers, comprised of 2 play 5, 4 play 3 and the remainder are play 1s, obviously I'm a fan. I wanted a playbar but couldn't justify the price. When the Beam came out I was thrilled! I received it and immediately set it up in my 450 sq ft bedroom, with peaked ceilings. I added two play 1s and, wow, it is awesome. TV sounds great, movies through Netflix, Google, Amazon sound phenomenal! If you are worried it won't be loud enough, it IS! You can control the sound through the Sonos app on your phone OR your cable remote, which is great because my old sound bar needed it's own remote. You can also control the sound from the rear speakers separately if it's too loud or not loud enough. You can auto tune the set up, or manually tune it to your liking. You can still play all your music or audible books, and wow, YouTube through Roku sounds AMAZING!. We were playing Ride of the Valkyries from youtube, and Ectasy of Gold and the kids complained it was too loud. You can listen to your TV on any of your Sonos speakers throughout your home... Which means you can listen to your digital music channels or a football game (or book TV) that's playing on your bedroom TV, while you are in another room. That's an awesome feature. Starwars movies sound like you are in the theater. The Lows and highs from the Beam are good for a room this size. I love the fact that I don't need a separate remote and that I can use Alexa commands too! The Sonos app walks you through the set up and it is so simple, my play ones were reconfigured and everything was working together within minutes. I am so happy Sonos came out with a less expensive sound bar. I realize it's not cheap, but if you have a Sonos setup or thinking of getting Sonos speakers, this IS the sound bar to get. I will be purchasing at least one more for the living room, with the Play 5 as my sub and two play 3 for right and left, the Beam will be more than sufficient. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because, by itself without the benefit of other Sonos speakers, it's good, but not great. This is the type of sound bar that really needs it's complimentary speakers to be truly great. With the additional speakers, 5 stars all the way. By itself, 4 stars with an additional half star for the wide array of music services you can use with the Sonos platform. Unless you have unrealistic expectations of a sound bar, I don't think you will be disappointed."},{"reviewerName":"Troy C.

I just want to point out some key points and updates related to the Beam that get lost in some of the older reviews.\n\n1) Know why you're getting this speaker. It's a great sound quality replacement for your TV's speakers. If you want true surround, buy a true surround system. If you want audiophile quality, go spend more money. This speaker is great for what it was designed to do. I love it. I have a separate Surround, audiophone quality setup in another room but for our Family room, this is perfect.\n\n2) I saw large complaints about the Beam working with ASUS networking gear. Must be old news. I am running a three router ASUS mesh networks. The Beam is working flawlessly.\n\n3) Networking gear matters. If yours is older or not a brand known for reliability you always run the risk of wonky connection issues with WiFi devices.\n\n4) Age of your TV matters. Mine is newer (<2 years old) and the ARC connection works perfectly with the Beam. Inputs change, audio levels change, and voices are in sync with video. I have an older TV with ARC (~6 years old) and got different results.\n\n5) I saw differing comments on Alexa working or not. First, it's clearly published that the Beam is not a replacement for an Amazon Echo. Some features just are not available. Check and make sure what you use is available. Second, others were commenting that the Beam wasn't picking up, \"Hey, Alexa.\" Could have been older firmware. My Beam as of late January's software, has picked up every request from different spots in the room and differing volume levels of my voice. It works.\n\nIf you're buying the Beam for the right use case, have newer gear (TV and networking) you will have a very good Beam experience.\n\nThe thing on quality I would note is that deciphering dialogue from TV shows, which was a problem on my Samsung, has massively improved. The Beam is great at isolating dialogue and projecting it while keeps background music and loud sounds in check. This is why I bought the Beam. Good stuff.\n\nFeb 11,2019 Update:\nStill a 5-star purchase bordering 5.5 stars. My 10-year-old son walked out of our exercise room, which has a similar Samsung TV, this past weekend and said, \"I am going upstairs. The sound is way better.\"\n\nAlexa is still working flawlessly even if the music is loud. The far-field microphones are rock solid.\n\nThe room we are in is 15 x 25 (family room + kitchen) and playing the Sonos on about 1/4th - 1/3rd volume is more than enough to fill up the room."},{"reviewerName":"Shopperstiltskin","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Finally the price drops to make it worth it","reviewDate":"August 11, 2018","reviewText":"Sonos has always had great equipment, but the prices have been silly and prevented many people from buying. I've wanted them for some time and with the release of this new soundbar I took the plunge. Bought this bar and 2 of the old Sonos one's without the built in Alexa. No need to have Alexa on more than one speaker in the room. The sound is AWESOME, and the Sonos setup app is as good as anything Apple could put together. I'm now going to get a few more sonos one's for the bedrooms with the alexa built in. The sub-woofer would perfect the sound, but that too is still at a silly price tag. I'll wait and see if they ever drop that as well. I have a suspicion that they will finally be mainstream with this new model and pricing, and they will be more competitive shortly all around. It's also nice they use the HDMI cable instead of the optical to connect to the TV. It's the industry standard now (as much as I hate it) and it makes things simple. You can even tell Alexa to turn on your tv and it does over the HDMI signal.\n\nWorth the price... if you are on the fence, don't be. You won't regret it...

I knew it was going to sound good, as my other 5 Sonos speakers sound great, but seriously was astounded by the wide sound field of this mighty little speaker! Listen to a concert or action movie and the room filling “surround sound” fully immerses you... honestly sounds better than my old 6 speaker with receiver system. Our tv room is small though, which helps.\n\nOne of the best features, to me- you can use this speaker to broadcast your tv sound to all other Sonos in your home/apt, which is major to me. Used to have to use a Connect box to do that. For some reason Sonos doesn’t brag about this ability anywhere I found.\n\nOne thing that freaked me during connecting it to my 4 yr old TV.... in the Sonos App walk-through, it say’s you need to find an HDMI input on your tv that’s labeled “ARC” (audio return channel), and that if your TV doesn’t have that it won’t support HDMI control of your TV for the speaker. Not so fast Sonos peeps! My Vizio TV has 4 HDMI inputs, and ALL of them support ARC, which I only found out by looking at input menu’s on my TV. Non are explicitly labeled that on back of TV. So my advice is def try out connecting HDMI to your (less than 5 yr old TV) before letting the app dissuade you!\n\nI can now turn my tv on and off with the speaker and change volume.\n\nSo I got rid of (see pic!!)

Sonos speakers are NOT yet ready for consumers. Just horrible software! Too bad because the sound quality and hardware is very good quality.

Love my other sonos products, ease of set up, sound, connectivity can’t be beat. Out of the box this Worked great, sounded amazing. Turn the tv off, later played music on it instead of tv and now it won’t play the tv at all - went thru all the sonos trouble shoooting stuff, tried everything I could think of, and when at the end of my rope and figuring let’s just wipe it and start over, well, no such option, just an endless loop of trying the sonos trouble shooter over and over again. my recommend is don’t waste your money - plenty of cheaper options at Best Buy than this P.O.S.. such a shame\n\nSOOOO, after spending a couple hours reading the endless amount of comments and complaints on the internet about how this thing interacts with samsung tv's, i found a fix. Believe it or not, unplugging the tv, then re-plugging it in gets it to recognize the sonos again - this is apparently a big issue between the sonos using HDMI-ARC connection with Samsung TV's. Haven't tried to play music through it again yet to see if I will need to do this every time, but will report back if that is the case. Increased my rating to 3 stars - I should not have had to spend hours trolling the internet to find a fix for this, but again, the sound is great, the clarity of dialogue in movies with a ton of background noise is totally what we were looking for and sonos delivers."},{"reviewerName":"Josh","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Elegant soundbar that just works, with a few minor quirks","reviewDate":"August 30, 2018","reviewText":"I've gone through a lot of soundbars. Most recently I tried two Sony soundbars and ended up returning them. The main thing I dislike about a lot of other soundbar setups is that they come with a separate subwoofer to put on the floor. With those setups the soundbar itself doesn't product much, if any, bass and relies on the subwoofer. Personally I don't like using up the floor space for the subwoofer because I really don't like tons of bass (I don't need to shake the whole room), and I live in an apartment so I don't want a speaker sitting directly on the floor firing down into my neighbor's apartment below.\n\nThe new Sonos Beam soundbar is great because it has full range sound from the single piece of equipment. A subwoofer isn't needed. Of course you can always add the wireless Sonos subwoofer if you really crave that earth-shaking bass, but I think for most people the bar alone produces enough bass for music and movies.\n\nThe soundbar is super easy to connect if your TV has an HDMI ARC port (most TVs from the last several years do). You plug in the power cable and then plug in one HDMI cable from the bar to your TV and you're done. The bar receives all the sounds from your TV and any connected devices and plays them. HDMI CEC also allows the bar to automatically power on with the TV and your TV remote will control the volume of the bar. Even connected devices can pass the volume control signal through the TV and to the Sonos bar. For instance, I am using an Apple TV and the volume control on the Apple TV remote controls the Sonos Beam volume now.\n\nThe bar works great for the TV sound but also is super easy to use for things like Spotify or internet radio. The Sonos app on your phone or tablet controls exactly what is playing out of the bar so you don't even need to have the TV turned on if you are using the soundbar for music.\n\nThe Alexa integration is superb and when paired with a service like Spotify allows you to just request songs and have them start playing... such as \"Alexa, play Where The Streets Have No Name by U2\"... a second later your song is playing. If you don't want to use Alexa or want to only use it occasionally there is a microphone on/off touch control on the top of the bar. Sonos is quick to point out that the microphone LED is hardwired to the microphone (rather than being controlled by software) so if the LED is off you can be sure the microphone is actually off. The only potential negative with the Beam compared to other Alexa devices (such as the traditional Amazon Echo devices), is that, at least as of this review, there is not a way to change the default wake word. You are forced to use \"Alexa\" - which may be problematic if you have an actual human Alexa in your household.\n\nThe bar itself looks elegant and blends in well with your entertainment setup. I opted for the white bar since my TV stand is white. The top panel has a very simple touch control setup with controls for volume up and down, play/pause, and microphone on/off. The back panel is extremely simple with just the power cable, a button for syncing, a wired network connection jack, and the HDMI port.\n\nBeing a Sonos device you can easily integrate this with your existing Sonos system or add more speakers for other rooms later. You can also add a pair of Sonos One speakers to act as true rear surround sound speakers and add the aforementioned subwoofer for a true 5.1 setup (although if you are wanting the rear surrounds and subwoofer you might be better off buying a regular receiver/speaker setup as the Sonos setup for 5.1 will cost you around $1500 and will not be nearly as flexible or configurable as a traditional setup). Personally I only recommend getting the Sonos Beam if you are looking for a simple, one device solution. If you start adding speakers you go down a path where there are better solutions for less money.\n\nThe overall sound quality is great although the stereo separation / sound field is not quite as wide as I was hoping. This may be because I don't have walls directly to the left and right of the speaker for the sound to reflect off of. The sound is not bad by any means, but I can definitely tell that the sound is coming from under the TV rather than from the sides like I'm used to with traditional speaker setups.\n\nIn my picture the Sonos Beam is shown beneath a 55\" Sony TV (XBR55X900F). I was hoping the bar would be able to slide completely under the TV so the front grille of the bar would be flush with the TV screen.. However, as you can see, it is just a hair too tall to be able to squeeze under the front edge of the TV. This isn't impacting the sound or anything but I was just hoping it would fit for a slightly cleaner look - although if it did then the top touch controls would have been inaccessible.\n\nThe only real complaint I have about this bar is the fact that it consumes the HDMI ARC port on your TV. Sonos has provided a way to avoid using the HDMI ARC port by supplying a HDMI to Optical adapter in the box. This allows you to connect the optical audio output from your TV to the Beam instead of using the HDMI cable. This is a workable solution, however when you use the optical cable you lose out on the remote control and sync functionality so you would have to control the volume from the Sonos app on your phone rather than being able to use the TV volume controls.\n\nThis HDMI ARC port issue may not bother you if you have a TV with multiple HDMI ports and they all support 4K and HDR, however on my Sony TV the only ports that support HDR are ports 2 and 3. Port 3 is the HDMI ARC port, so I essentially have to \"waste\" that port's HDR ability by connecting it to the Sonos just for audio. Once I do that all I'm left with is HDMI port 2 on the TV for HDR use. Right now I have my Apple TV connected to this port, but if I add another HDR device in the future (UHD Blu-Ray, Playstation, Xbox One, etc.) I won't have a free port on the TV to use with the new device and will have to get some kind of external HDMI switch. This is one area where a traditional home theater receiver is a better solution as you can connect multiple HDMI sources to the receiver and have it act like the switch. With the Sonos Beam you use up the HDMI ARC port on your TV but aren't using it for video, just the audio path from the TV to the Beam.\n\nPros:\n- Great sound from a tiny soundbar\n- Black or white color options let you choose the one that blends in best to your environment\n- Simple single HDMI cable connection\n- CEC control allows the TV and connected devices to adjust the volume and turn the soundbar on and off\n- Sonos ecosystem for music and multi-room audio\n- Alexa integration so this can replace an existing Amazon Echo or similar device\n\nCons:\n- Sound field is not very wide if you don't have a small room with sidewalls to reflect the sound\n- HDMI ARC connection may consume a valuable HDMI port on your TV and limit the available ports you have for use with actual video devices, especially if you have multiple 4K/HDR capable devices\n- Alexa wake word cannot be changed from \"Alexa\"\n- Subwoofer is not included, so people who expect tons of bass may not be satisfied (I think the bass from the bar itself is more than enough)\n\nTo summarize, this is the best soundbar I've tried so far. If you're looking for a simple solution to give your TV and music better sound, while at the same time looking nice in you room, then this is definitely the soundbar to get. Don't expect it to match the full sound you'd get from a traditional home theater setup but it more than makes up for that with it's simplicity. If you already use the Sonos system in your house or Alexa devices then those features are just icing on the cake with the Sonos Beam as it will integrate perfectly with both the Sonos and Alexa ecosystems."},{"reviewerName":"RVwino","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"What a frustrating disappointment.","reviewDate":"The manufacturer commented on the review below","reviewText":"I bought the beam, two play:1s, and the subwoofer for my new tv surround sound.

I've always hated (and continue to do so) the fact that Sonos speakers can't do double-duty as Bluetooth speakers, but with the latest updates (Sonos and iOS) you can now at least use AirPlay to push whatever you have on your phone. Big win. I'm not an audiophile but the sound is great to me! We have a small / open living room and this is the only speaker for our wall-mounted TV; works awesome in that setting. Nit picky complaint: Really wish the wires (HDMI and power) were WHITE for the white speaker (as they are for the Play:1, for example). Probably not the best value out there, but if you value design and have any existing Sonos speakers, I'd definitely recommend it."},{"reviewerName":"D. Rangel","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Solution for de-cluttering hifi components without compromising sound","reviewDate":"September 2, 2018","reviewText":"I am a stereo HiFi enthusiast who got tired of looking at the wires and components cluttering up my small living room. I had been considering going wireless with Sonos for living room listening for a long time, but hesitated because I thought the sound would not be as good as having good, separate components, and I was wary of \"listener fatigue\" if the Sonos speakers sounded too harsh or digital. But the Beam with two Sonos One speakers as surround set up are just great. I started out with only the Beam as my first Sonos product, hooked up to TV and streaming Netflix, Hulu, HBO Now, Showtime, etc., via Fire TV and Apple TV, and listening to music via Spotify, Apple Music and Amazon Prime Music. I use the Sonos app as well as the independent apps for each streaming service on my iPad. I just wanted to see if there was a big difference in sound, so I added Apple Music for a month to compare with Spotify, which is my primary streaming service. (I'm sticking with Spotify for various reasons.) I took a chance buying the Beam without having tested one out at a retail store. It turns out I was so happy with the Beam that I figured building a system to have a surround experience would be even better, and after buying two Sonos Ones a few weeks later, I can say that it it truly is. I would recommend this system to anyone who wants to de-clutter without compromising sound. Super easy to set up and use. Makes me want to listen to music even more than before. Beautiful speaker design as well. Top quality in every way. I have to say that those who have commented that the volume is not loud enough must not know that you can raise the volume, one lever for TV, one for Music, which applies to your TV sound, in the Advanced Audio setting, which is different from the general volume control on the app. Then there is another setting for Music listening only, with a choice of either Ambient or Full. The default setting is Ambient, which is softer and not as full as Full! Big difference in sound. Full will give you a richer more well rounded sound. Once you set those volumes and exit Advanced Audio, you are good to go, and the general volume control of the app is the only one you have to use from then on. I rarely have to go as high as even half way because the volume is very loud and clear. Another thing is that TruePlay is essential and makes a significant difference, so if you don't take that step to customize the sound to your surroundings (takes 5 minutes or less), you are missing out. The sound is full, detailed, and warm, emits what you get with stereo hifi listening. I hear details in music that have not heard when listening to music in my former streaming set up, which was an Echo Dot connected to an integrated amp, listening through speakers hooked up to the amp. I also had a cd player and turntable connected to the amp. Those are now all packed away. Now I have only the Beam connected to my TV and the Sonos Ones in two different spots away from the TV. I still love albums, so next I might have to get the Play 5 and input the turntable to it, but for now I am very satisfied solely with streaming. The overall excellence of the Beam was a great surprise to this music listener!"},{"reviewerName":"M.

I've started relying more on my Sonos app remote to mute first, then talk to Alexa. I also am not a giant fan of the app remote- I find it difficult to get the volume to the right level using either the slider or my phone buttons; it always ends up just a little too quiet or a little too loud.

They do not play together, you have to either have all echo devices, or all sonos devices. This was very frustrating for me because I used multi room music daily before I replaced the echo with the sonos beam. #2 drop in: this was also a feature I used daily to communicate around the house. This feature is not supported with sonos. #3 calling: once again, daily, I used to use my echo device to call people in my living room while cleaning, or working. you cannot do this on the sonos either. So, essentially this thing is one giant overpriced piece of crap for me. It does nothing for me. The sound quality is phenomenal, but I will be returning it.

It's my first Sonos purchase, followed by two Sonos Plays to achieve the 5.0 surround sound experience in my apartment.\n\nThey system is wireless and for the most part works flawlessly. I did get stumped a bit with setting up the wireless but after a few restarts here and there, I got it going. And in 3 months, it bugged out on me once and I had to restart a bunch of things to get it going. I use spotify quite frequently as well, and that mostly works smooth, but sometimes it's a disaster as songs don't play or keep switching. Overall all, still pretty good, but not perfect\n\nThe sound is quite nice for the size considering clarity and punch of the bass. Don't expect theatric booming/rumbling; you have to get a subwoofer for that. But for an apartment, it's plenty...more than this and you'll get complaints from neighbors. But if you want theatre rumbling....ooh that is quite the experience, then go for a bigger system.\n\nHowever, I'm most disappointed with the surround sound. As many have said, it's not true surround sound. When you compare side-to-side with a true surround sound, you will see the Beam cannot even compete...not even with the addition of the 2 Sonos Plays.

For reference I have Martin Logan speakers with Parasound and Adcom electronics because I used to be heavily into audio, but I really wanted to simplify my life and clean up the clutter in the family room. Enter the soundbar search! I still had a little bit of the audio snob in me because at first I decided that I really needed Dolby Atmos, so I was close to pulling the trigger on a 1.5k Samsung or Sony system. But then enter a whole bunch of technical gobbledegook about needing eARC and current HDMI ARC outputs not being upgradeable and lack of streaming Atmos content and yadda yadda yadda - ok forget Atmos.\n\nSo I decided to heck with Atmos, just give me a basic soundbar. Then I was about to pull the trigger on a $100 Yamaha when I realized it didn't have HDMI ARC. That was the one thing I wasn't going to compromise on - I wanted the soundbar to act like the tv's built-in speaker, and HDMI ARC allows the tv remote to control the volume of the soundbar vs optical requiring you to use the soundbar's remote. I wanted to simplify my life and getting rid of remotes was part of that!\n\nI had just gotten my first Sonos speaker for Christmas, a Play:1. So I started looking at Sonos soundbars. Sadly neither the Playbar nor the Playbase has ARC. But surprisingly their cheapest, smallest speaker - the Beam - does have ARC! Finally I pulled the trigger and got the Beam and another Play:1 so I could have a pair for surround.\n\nOk finally the actual review - everything works flawlessly. Really, that's all you need to know right there. Setup was a breeze, my tv works fine with the Cox cable box connected via HDMI and the Beam connected via HDMI ARC. Alexa works fine for playing music and radio. Spotify and Pandora stream perfectly. The sound is good but obviously doesn't compare to my previous setup, but it's less than 1/10th the price so I can't complain. After the Sonos auto-tuning I did adjust bass down one notch and treble up one notch. The system sounded a bit closed-in at first, like it was buried under a few towels, but after a day or two either I've gotten used to it or the speakers have broken-in and now sound much lighter. The Sonos app confirms that they are receiving the Dolby Digital signal, so yay.\n\nFor people that are true movie lovers that like to play at Dolby reference levels (i.e. really loud), this speaker will probably not do it for you in the bass department. For normal people, I think it's perfectly fine. The bass is not really deep, but is certainly adequate and definitely much better than the tv's built-in speakers. If Sonos offered a $200 sub, I'd be all over it. But I'll pass on their $700 sub. The little Beam does look puny sitting under my 82\" tv, so if the larger Playbar had ARC I probably would've bought that instead both for looks and a wider soundstage. Yes, another small nit is that the soundstage of the Beam is not huge at lower volumes, so if that's important then maybe keep looking. For my purposes, it's just fine. The soundstage does seem to get larger at higher volumes which is nice when you're ready to sit and watch a loud movie, but it's not going to make you think you have a left-center-right setup.\n\nNote that since the Beam and Play:1 surrounds are all linked together into a single room/system, you can't stream to them individually. I'm not sure why you'd want to, but if you wanted to maybe pick up a surround speaker and take it outside and play it by itself without playing the rest of the speakers, you'd probably have to undo the surround configuration. Also fyi, the Sonos TruePlay speaker auto-tune software is not available for Android (iOS only). It's not a huge requirement but worth knowing.\n\nBottom line - it has HDMI ARC, it sounds great, everything works as advertised. Highly recommended unless you're the type that needs a subwoofer and plays movies really loud."},{"reviewerName":"William Bell","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great sound, Seamless and Easy Set Up","reviewDate":"August 9, 2018","reviewText":"This thing is the perfect solution for my apartment home theatre set up as we already had two Sonos Play 1s to use as surround sounds.

I wanted something that would offer comparable sound quality that would work with both Alexa and my tv, hence my excitement at the Sonos beam.\n\nFrom an integration standpoint this is exactly what I needed. Alexa performs well, the bar form factor works better against the wall where the dot would often false trigger or would get confused on the directionality of my voice. Or I would often have to raise my voice to get Alexa to trigger.\n\nHowever the sound quality is a little disappointing. The soundstage is not as wide as the Harmans and the stereo separation is definitely not good. The mid and high range sound a bit muted and the bass lacks definition. Now these are definitely hard problems to solve in this form factor, but for $400 I was expecting a bit more. When not directly comparing I guess the sound is pretty good but for those with discerning ears you will definitely be missing something.\n\nOverall this is probably your best bet if you want one device that can do it all, but it’s still a compromise."},{"reviewerName":"Alvin, Simon, Fyodor","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Horribly unreliable; old wireless technology","reviewDate":"The manufacturer commented on the review below","reviewText":"The sound quality is good - when it works.

Right from the start there are annoying things about it that grow worse over time.\n\nFirst off, it's unbelievably slow when adjusting volume. You literally sit there with your finger on the volume up (or down) for close to 20 seconds to go from silence to a good sound level. And vice versa. In addition, you're forced to view a giant promo window for the product during the whole time volume changes. After a while, you start to hate the brand name because it flashes across the bottom of your screen every time you change the volume even one tick.\n\nIt also loses its connection with Alexa constantly. And to re-establish, there is no clear instruction other than to start the pairing process from scratch.\n\nLastly, the volume is crazy uneven from station to station or device to device. Switching from cable stations to Netflix or Amazon Prime will blow the ceiling off your room if you forget to put the volume almost all the way down first. If you live in an apartment, be prepared for neighbors to hate you.\n\nAnd don't expect any help from Customer Service. Getting in touch with them to talk about these issues produced ridiculous boilerplate responses that essentially deny there are any issues. What you hear is arrogance about the Sonos label.\n\nAll in all, this is a product that doesn't live up to its hype.

A connect, 2 Play:1s and 2 Play:Ones. I love the sound, I love the ease of use, and I love the voice integration with Alexa, so the Beam seemed like a great way to expand into my living room. The living room is 24x14x9. The TV is a 65 inch in the corner, and it has an older Harman Kardon receiver, center channel, two fronts and a sub. I loved the sound, but it didn't pass the wife acceptance factor with no ARC and no 4k pass through.\n\nThe Beam seemed like it could be a great way to get Alexa and simplify the setup. I got the Beam (late, thanks Amazon...) and tried it with two Play:1s. The Beam when you were up close sounded great, but when you were in the back of the room, it just couldn't fill the area. The sound very much felt like it was coming from one place, it didn't have enough spread to immerse the room in sound. I was hoping to use the Play:1 speakers as additional fronts, but they can only be Surrounds.\n\nSo the Beam is probably good if you have a smaller living room or bedroom or den. It is probably good if you are upgrading from TV speakers. But if you are trying to replace a dedicated 3.1 system, it just can't cut it.

I bought them at Best Buy and had them install them, and it was a time consuming process. A real negative is only being able to control the volume with my phone app or Alexa. I bought expensive universal remote control devices for both systems but the installer could not get them to control the volume of the Sonos systems. (I have since returned both of the remotes for that reason and others.) The cable guy couldn't get the cable remote to control the volume, and I spent 1 hour & 10 minutes on the phone with Amazon Fire Stick support trying unsuccessfully to get the Fire remote to pair with the Sonos. When I ask Alexa to change the volume she can't seem to change it in small increments so I have to tell her up or down a few times until she gets it where I want it.

I instantly wanted to expand the Sonos footprint into the rest of my house. 5 months later, I now have a 16-component system with 10 zones, consisting of 3 Beams, 10 Play Ones, 2 Connects and a Boost. The first few months was a challenge. I have enterprise-grade WiFi in my home, with an access point on each floor and outside. I thought this system could easily handle the Sonos system, but quickly learned that was not the right answer, as speakers would skip, drop, or just become invisible to the app all the time.\n\nAfter some research, I decided to try and wire one of the Beams and use Sonos-net (mesh) for the speakers. This was an improvement, but still had the consistent drops of speakers.\n\nNext came the Boost. This nearly fixed everything. I put the Boost on a wired connection and in a central location in my house. This got things to about 80% stable. There was still the occasional stop or drop of a speaker or a pair somewhere, but it was on the right track.\n\nSince Sonos-net still uses the 2.4GHz spectrum, I had a ton of interference (living in the middle of a city, and had plenty of WiFi traffic in my own home with 50+ wireless devices on both 2.4/5 spectra).\n\nI finally decided to run Cat-5e to as many speakers/devices as possible. My final configuration has 6 of the devices wired into the core network. On the devices that are wired, I turned off the wireless in advanced settings, so they would not act as mesh repeaters. The boost still connects to 5 speakers I could not get hard wired (not including 4 speakers that are satellites to a couple of Beams, which use the 5GHz spectrum anyway and weren't causing extra interference).\n\nThe whole system is rock solid now, and we can enjoy music in the entire house, backyard and garage with no skips, buffers, drops, etc, using almost any source on the Sonos network (vinyl, TV, streaming stations). There still is an existing problem with AirPlay2 consistently dropping out, but this is a known issue according to Sonos community.\n\nEach house is going to be a different install, and the bigger the install gets, the more complex the network issues can become - I would recommend finding a friend that has some network knowledge once you get past 4-5 speakers. At minimum, the Boost fixed most of the issues (and is the cheapest Sonos component you can get!)."},{"reviewerName":"AreYouKidding?","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great addition to my Sonos and Alexa family","reviewDate":"November 8, 2018","reviewText":"I assume like most, the Beam replaced a couple older devices for me.

I needed something smaller and HDMI connected for my TV and this fit the bill. The SONOS Playbar is bigger but is only optical and would not have Alexa or ability to use only my TV remote to control audio.\n\nIt synced almost immediately with my TV (a 7 year-old Samsung with HDMI-ARC). I already had Sonos Play:1 speakers and a Play:3 and I wanted something to give my Family room a full and rich sound for both music and television. This does the trick.\n\nMy Family Room is not huge (20 ft. x 12 ft.) but this thing is more than loud enough with volume set at less than half. When you add in the 3 other Sonos speakers, it is like having a symphony in your home (especially after a little TruePlay tuning which is included in the Sonos app for iPhones. If you have a Play:3 speaker in the setup, you may not even need a subwoofer. I'm still debating whether to add one. That is why I give this a 4 on versatility. If you want a wireless sub, you have to buy Sonos. No other sub can be connected without being wired or used with a Connect:Amp. Even if you could, there would be the problem of syncing audio and video. Since the Beam does NOT come with its own remote and on-screen menu, I don't know how you would do that. Also, it only has 1 HDMI connection which can be converted to Optical with a provided converter cable. But, you can't have both HDMI and Optical at same time. Not a big deal if your house is all SONOS.\n\nI used to have a Sony Soundbar (HTCT-790) and wireless subwoofer that worked pretty well with my Samsung TV but it allowed syncing via a remote and on-screen menu. It was very difficult, however, to get it to play well with my Sonos speakers connected to TV via a SONOS Connect device. Hence, I opted for ALL Sonos for ease of connection and great, synchronized sound. A few more bucks but worth it. Besides, I'll sell the very good Sony sound bar and SONOS Connect on E-Bay and make most of my Sonos Beam money back. So, then, I will be thoroughly satisfied."},{"reviewerName":"Joseph Jones","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"It’s an okay soundbar","reviewDate":"September 19, 2019","reviewText":"I’m not going to write an in-depth review, I’m sure there are many of those already but I will tell you what I think of this speaker after about 9 months of ownership. As a soundbar, it works well enough but there are aspects of the way in which it works that aren’t terribly intuitive. Firstly, the setup seems easy enough, but you have to download an app to do it. And you have to use that app anytime you want to stream to it. The Sonos app uses its own player for the different apps you already have on your phone, like Spotify, Amazon, and so on. Which means if you’re listening to music on Spotify in your car and you want to pick up where you left off at home, you can’t do that. For one song, that isn’t a big deal but if you’re 40 songs into a playlist, 40 minutes into a podcast, or 40 chapters into an audiobook, it’s really inconvenient to have to use the Sonos app to play these things on the beam. Either it won’t remember where the apps left off or the apps won’t remember where it leaves off and it’s just a pain to use. If it’s connected to my television via arc, it should be able to stream via Bluetooth from any app.\n\nThat’s like most of my gripe with this thing but also the “night” and “voice” modes don’t work very well either. The sound in general is very mediocre. It sounds fine, but no better than many cheaper options. Even after the sound optimization the app takes 10 minutes to do when you start it up for the first time. I don’t know what it is about the night mode that these new speakers have so much trouble with. I had an old JVC surround receiver back in the late 90s that achieved a far superior night mode where it just cuts out the bass, levels out the mids, and boosts the highs. The Sonos beam does not do this well. I live in a 700 sq/foot apartment, it shouldn’t suck at this kind of thing. But it does.\n\nAnd for some reason, Alexa doesn’t respond to my voice commands for the volume anymore. I don’t know if that is due to adding the arc input a couple of months after I started using it when I got a new 4K set with arc out, allowing me to control the volume from the tv remote, or if it just doesn’t work. Using the app for this was neither convenient nor precise, which was why the voice control was useful.\n\nAll and all, it’s an okay soundbar. If you want one with the best sound, buy the Sennheiser Ambeo for $2500. The Sonos is slightly more expensive than most in this class, decent sound for casuals, but after 9 months of owning this, I’m considering buying the Roku smart soundbar. It’s essentially the same thing with a built-in roku ultra 4K HDR streaming device for $180. I doubt very seriously it sounds any worse than the Sonos beam."},{"reviewerName":"Zach","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Better than expected audio quality with a high quality app for control","reviewDate":"January 4, 2019","reviewText":"This thing is pretty incredible, especially considering the size.

DTS support. No it doesn't support DTS.

There are things I love about it. There are things I really hate about it. Every time I tell it to play some music, it shouts at me really loud that it's going to play the music, then it plays the music really loud. Why can it not remember the last volume that was in use? The Alexa support is so HORRIFIC. It insists on responding to every Alexa request even though it cannot accomplish most tasks that Alexa is asked to do. I am talking to any of the Alexa devices in the room that CAN accomplish those tasks, but the Sonos responds \"I'm sorry, camera control is not available on this device\" and things like that, instead of just allowing the Echo Show to respond, for example. This became so aggravating that I was forced to actually reconfigure every other Echo in my home to respond to \"Amazon\" instead of \"Alexa\", and I will have to retrain myself to say \"Amazon\" all the time, except say \"Alexa\" only when I actually want the Sonos to respond. This is necessary since reconfiguring the Sonos to respond to a different wake word is one of the many Echo features that the Sonos does not have. (And by the way, even if you do hook this up to the TV using HDMI, it still cannot change the INPUT on the TV. The advert makes you think you can virtually discard your TV's remote control, but one of the most important buttons on the TV's remote is something that can not be controlled by voice. That's not Sonos's fault. Research (after the fact) has taught me that controlling the TV's INPUT button is not something you can expect, even with a lot of newer TVs.) The Sonos's dialog mode and night mode make a noticeable difference in the sound but not enough to really matter; I still have to use headphones for certain shows because people just do not enunciate anymore. The TV sounds very good through the Sonos, and so does music, and I do love to be able to tell Alexa to play whatever music I want, on a decent speaker instead of the ones built into the Echo devices.

I wish I could blast this thing but considering the neighbors, I keep it at 25% and it still sounds great.

Love Sonos and just hooked up the beam and also bought the wall mount for $60 (a bit pricy) and drilled the holes, connected and auto tuned in 38 minutes. I’m not super handy but very easy and cardboard template included with mount and used a level so after a few quick 5/16 drilled holes, anchors and screwed bracket in place. Beam comes with HDMI cord and also an optical connector in the event your TV is a bit older. Don’t plan on using Alexa as I’m an Apple house but it’s there if you are into that. Might grab a pair of the One Speakers without Alexa for rear surround. Probably overkill to add the $699 woofer for watching the news and the end of movies in bed but if they come out with a new smaller one, I’d buy in a heartbeat. Anyway, love Sonos and you get what you pay for even if their stuff is a bit high. The look and easy connection makes its worth that extra money. Oh and have Apple 4K TV set up on family room and an older Apple TV in bedroom.

I have the Beam connected to my TV via HDMI ARC and I do not have any additional Sonos speakers to pair with it. My Sonos is connected to Alexa as well as my iTunes and Pandora accounts. I have completed the truetone sound test/customization. So that’s my set up.\n\nOverall the Beam sounds much nicer than my Samsung sound bar. There is actually more bass with just the Beam. Additionally the voices are clearer (one of the main reasons I opted to change from the Samsung system I had) and there seems to be better sound separation (more of a stereo effect).\n\nThe Alexa works well overall. I find that I have to command it with a stronger voice than my Echo. It turns the TV on and off without a hitch and does respond to voice commands relatively well.\n\nI think the main downfall here is the integration with iTunes. I have not found a way to have the Beam play music from my iTunes when asked via Alexa. It seems that the only way for me to play music from my iTunes account is to go through the Sonos app. In contrast, my Echo will play music through my iTunes without problem when asked using Alexa. I might be missing something with the set up but if this is indeed the case, I think it is a major shortfall of the system.\n\nWhile I like the speaker overall, and it is an upgrade, I was expecting it to behave in a similar fashion to the Echo. Unfortunately it doesn’t and I now have to learn another app, almost like being in a walled garden that is within a walled garden. I don’t want my sound system to introduce new barriers. As a result I am now contemplating returning it and will possibly look into Bose 500 sound bar."},{"reviewerName":"BKextra","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"GREAT starter to Sonos Ecosystem - simple to pair with older Sonos speakers and a major upgrade","reviewDate":"October 22, 2019","reviewText":"WHY DID I GET THIS? DID I NEED IT?\nI already had the basic Sonos Play:1 Speakers (without Alexa built in). I already appreciated Sonos’ no-nonsense setup for the speakers I already had and thought that the Sonos Beam would be a simple way to add Surround Sound to my TV audio setup (using the Play:1 speakers as my rear speakers). I’m really pleased with the way that I was able to simply set up the beam as my front speaker and the quality of sound is as good as most other surround sound setups that I have used in the past.\n\nWhile I don’t consider myself an expert audiophile, I certainly enjoy good sound for music, TV, and movies and the Sonos Beam is a great way to upgrade sound quality for any sound needs that I have. I’ve used high-end systems running wires through walls connected to expensive amps and quite frankly, the Sonos setup is the most elegant, simple to set up, all without compromising on great sound. Even though in the past I’ve gone to great lengths to have good sound (cutting drywall, running lines, adding power), I don’t think I’ll ever have to do that again now that I’m invested in the Sonos ecosystem.\n\n[ Side Note: philosophically, it’s as important to me to be invested in a good ecosystem as much as just having good equipment - I think Sonos’ ecosystem is super stable and scalable as industry leaders in the smart/wireless speaker world]\n\nWHAT DOES IT DO?\nObviously, Sonos has built its reputation on providing solid, great sound experiences. The Beam is no different and Sonos once again nailed it through this product.\n\nI think the most important feature of the Sonos Beam is that without compromising on great sound quality, the set up is so simple and all I needed was plug-in outlets and voila! It was all set up to use seamlessly with my TV, smart home setup, Apple Music (or Spotify), etc.\n\nDOES IT WORK AS IT SHOULD?\nI think any reviewers complaining about difficult setup must have gotten a faulty product. We have 3 different Beam set ups and they were so easy to install and then optimize through the Sonos app.\n\nIS THERE ANYTHING I DISLIKE ABOUT THIS PRODUCT?\nOf course, I wish everything in life was cheaper, but the price is ultimately worth it. The only thing that I wish Sonos did better was provide simple solutions to hang under TVs. We have the Beam shelf, but we don’t find it worth the price.\n\nIS THERE A BETTER PRODUCT?\nI’m sure there are better sound quality products out there, but probably none that are as easy to set up and just work straight out of box like Sonos products. Obviously, I’m a big fan here now, but I’m always on the lookout and have tried several different products over time (Samsung speakers and sound bars that are just as expensive, Yamaha set ups, different 7.1 setups), but frankly the ease of use and the ecosystem that Sonos provide make this the superior product for our family’s needs with music, TV, and movies."},{"reviewerName":"CM-327","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Big things come in small packages! Sonos Beam packs a punch!","reviewDate":"July 24, 2019","reviewText":"This soundbar is pretty awesome. I was lucky enough to snag one for the prime day discount, but even at the full price, it packs great sound quality and features and is well worth it. I purchased this with two Play:1 speakers that I set up as rear surrounds and I highly recommend this combination (side note, setup could seriously not be any easier... Having set up a bunch of stereo equipment in the past, this felt like cheating; it was too easy!). The Beam sounds really good on its own but the rear surrounds seriously take it to the next level. I also highly recommend doing the True Play tuning. I had to borrow a relative's iPhone to do this since the android version of the app doesn't have the feature (super lame if you ask me) but it was worth the trouble. I was really surprised to hear the difference. This is my first Sonos setup and I'm already a fan for life. The Sonos ecosystem works seamlessly and really shines in the software department. It's also clear that they care about audio quality. Especially for music, this system sounds amazing. I used to think Bose, Klipsch, etc were the only ones to consider for home theater but Sonos has really won me over here. I just finished watching Stranger Things 3 with my new Sonos Beam and Play:1 rears and it was an incredibly immersive experience audio-wise. The build quality is also amazing and the the sound bar looks sleek and minimalistic in my living room. I'm a big Alexa user and that function works flawlessly as well. I have this soundbar connected via ARC to a TCL Roku TV and have also tested on an older Vizio... Both work great. Finally, the speech enhancement and night modes are really useful for watching TV and movies. Overall I'd say this is one of the best purchases I've made in a while. Definitely consider buying a couple of Play:1s as rears because that makes a huge difference. My next step is to buy the Sonos sub, but that thing is so ridiculously expensive, it's going to be quite a while! (that said bass is pretty darn good without the sub after True Play tuning and adjusting the equalizer)."},{"reviewerName":"Michelle V","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Good sound for this price point","reviewDate":"August 27, 2018","reviewText":"Installation was a little more involved than I imagined. I was not able to complete the installation without hooking up the speaker to my router (temporarily), in order for it to register my wi-fi settings. Other than that, it went very seamlessly. The sound is good (much better than my Samsung TV speakers alone). If you are looking for a more robust sound, I'd definitely invest in the sub and maybe some additional speakers.

I was also surprised how not having a physical remote didn’t seem like a limitation even though I strongly dislike app only remotes.\nLong story short I moved this to another room and had the audio working via toslink, shut off the projector, went back, and then couldn’t get sound. I couldn’t change the input (so I thought) because I didn’t have a remote control. After a very frustrating 1 hr and 51 minutes on the phone with a very incompetent tech support agent (not domestic) she finally figured out I need to choose TV in the app. The app doesn’t tell you you’re changing the input so this isn’t intuitive but you’d think Sonos tech support would know the basics of their products. You’d think they’d know that the echo functionality doesn’t require the beam to be hooked up to a tv via HDMI-ARC but no, that’s what she insisted repeatedly. Foolishly I expected domestic, well trained support for my $400 sound bar that’s paired with the $300 worth of rear speakers but I guess Sonos is too overly confident in their “it’s so easy and it just works” attitude that they feel like they can cheap out on after purchase support.\nThe worst part is that I knew this agent was incompetent but it’s not like I can hang up and wait 35 minutes on hold again hoping the next one is any better. Really disappointed in Sonos. A $5 remote with 3 input buttons could have avoided these hours if frustration and running around the house with the beam hooking it up to (literally) 4 different devices troubleshooting a simple incorrect input selection."},{"reviewerName":"Henry Guinn","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great Sound Quality - Easy to Install","reviewDate":"July 24, 2019","reviewText":"I have a 2016 4k Sony Bravia TV and wanted to upgrade the sound quality. After several months of investigation I chose the Sonos Beam for three reasons. First, the sound quality. Almost universally it was rated highly for its sound quality. Second it has Amazon's Alexa voice control built in. I'm not a big fan of the whole voice control shtick but it did allow me to access my Amazon Music Unlimited as well as my TV so I could use it for both. Living in a small apt, having both coming from the same unit is a real plus. And third, was the price. Though certainly not cheap it is still affordable for the average consumer. I waited until Prime Day and got a great deal on the Sonos Beam saving almost $150 off the list price.\n\nIt took about 15 minutes to set up completely including getting it out of the box. I'm not sure why some people complained about the difficulty of getting it to work but there was absolutely no problem for me. The only glitch was that Alexa kept losing the ability to turn the TV on and off. I found the problem was a setting on my TV that I had somehow turned on which said that when I turn off the TV any HDMI connected device would also automatically be turned off as well. Once I switched that setting off it has worked perfectly since.\n\nThe Sonos Beam is a perfect sound system for a small to medium apt. You can have clear distinct, high quality audio without annoying your neighbors. I don't know why anyone would want more bass than what it offers. Perhaps because I am not a big fan of the kind of movies that require a lot of bass I find the bass that exists more than adequate for my daily needs which are mostly news, PBS and science shows, and football.\n\nBottom line I highly recommend the Sonos Beam especially for small to medium rooms."},{"reviewerName":"Capt. Beefheart","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great sound system, unless you want to occasionally use headphones","reviewDate":"March 8, 2019","reviewText":"I purchased this system and hooked it up to my LG OLED 55\" TV. It provides really great sound. I have it connected via HDMI ARC. Setup was pretty easy to this point, once you figured out the settings on the LG TV for HDMI ARC and SIMPLINK. I used it for a couple of days. I watched \"Free Solo\" on it and it sounded great. In a dedicated TV room where you never have to use headphones this system is awesome.\n\nBut I live in the real world. My TV is in the living room. Occasionally my wife asks me to use headphones. I thought, okay, it's probably got built-in bluetooth and I can hook up directly to the Beam. No. Then I thought, okay, I'll switch to the headphones on the TV and listen that way. But the HDMI ARC connection overrides the bluetooth output. I can switch to the bluetooth headphones, but the Sonos will take over again. Always.\n\nSo I looked at the Sonos discussion boards. There was a 3 page thread on this problem from a lot of users. Apparently Sonos Support considers this a TV problem even though this happens with the 2 biggest brands of high-end TV's: Samsung and LG. Sonos Support recommends disconnecting the HDMI ARC cable from the Sonos Beam to use headphones. I'm not going to do this. The other suggestions were to turn off SIMPLINK in addition to switching to bluetooth, or buy a bluetooth adapter for the optical out port. I don't want to do these extra steps.\n\nWhat I want (and apparently a lot of other people want, based on the Sonos discussion boards) is an *easy* way to use headphones with the Sonos Beam. Sure, I love the sound from the Sonos Beam, but if my wife asks me to use the headphones I want to be able to turn them on, have the Sonos Beam automatically muted and watch my TV. I don't think that is asking too much.\n\nC'mon Sonos, the Beam is supposed to be easy. It's not for those of us that occasionally have to use headphones. I'm returning it."},{"reviewerName":"C.

I was really looking forward to adding this to my system.\n\nI found out quickly that this was not the product for me. There were too many limitations in the way this product handles all of the audio sources.\n\nThe first issue is that the CEC detection is finnicky with my tv. I found the HDMI cable included to be defective. Once it detected using another HDMI cable for the most part it was fine. Occasionally the tv audio would not go through the beam and I would have to dig through the Sonos settings to get it back to the tv or sometimes I couldn't get the tv to not be the source and I would have mess around with the unit.\n\nOnce this is connected to the tv it will always be the source of audio for the tv. I was not able to tune the beam in a way that I could use it for the tv all the time. Essentially it wound up just being too loud all of the time, especially in order to hear voices. I know that there is a night time setting but that wound up not sounding even as good as my tv speakers and adds more steps and futzing. This was supposed to simplify things wasn't it. This was ultimately the downfall of this device for me.\n\nOnce I tuned to try and hit this sweet spot for most of my tv listening that meant that listening for music was affected. Sonos does not offer presets or per source tuning so there is then more messing with settings.\n\nAs for sound quality, if you like to listen to things as medium to high volumes all the time this might be for you. I had a weekend where I watched a few movies by myself and had it cranked. It definitely gives you great sound for the most part. I don't believe the voice enhancement comes anywhere close to advertised. I found voices to be drowned out regularly requiring higher volumes even with the feature turned on.\n\nAdd on to the fact that I am not the only one using this tv and then it becomes another device I have to help support when it doesn't quite work right.

I ended up replacing the Play 1 with a Play 3 because it didn’t sound good enough for the price I paid when I could get a Play 3 for $100 dollars more. I’ve been running the Play 3 paired to an Amazon Echo so I could voice control it. The Play 3 was awesome but lacked the ability to airplay with my iPhone, which isn’t critical but is really convenient. I needed a sound bar for my TV and didn’t want to pay $600 for the Playbar which seemed too expensive for the lack of features I wanted, so when I heard that Sonos was releasing a new sound bar with AirPlay and Alexa built in I was psyched. I finished setting up my new Beam about an hour ago and have tried it with movies, TV shows, PlayStation 4 games and of course music. I have to say that it sounds phenomenal! It has a bigger sound than my Play 3 but the fact that it plugs into my TV and has built in Alexa control means that it can replace multiple devices in my house. One great thing is that I no longer have to say “Alexa, do X on Sonos” but can just say “Alexa, do X”. It’s a small thing but one I appreciate.\n\nIf you get the beam, note that you need to pair your TV remote with the beam afterwards. Just go into the Sonos app settings, click the room you have the Beam in, and sync with the remote. It takes all of 10 seconds and couldn’t be easier but it took me a little while to figure out that I needed to do this in order to use my TV remote to control the TV volume like usual. Hopefully this will save you a little time as well!"},{"reviewerName":"Carole Shackelford","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Firmware needs a lot more work.","reviewDate":"July 4, 2019","reviewText":"The product is solid!

I listened to this in a store and was pretty impressed at the sound for the size, but you never know what it will sound like when you get home. For me it sounds even better than expected.\n\nI have a full HT setup in another room for my real HT use and I like my speakers and sound quality in general. This is my living room setup and it is paired with a 55\" TCL Roku TV. This is perfect for that room, it sounds good and we've never had it up to maybe a little more than halfway depending on the source. I am connected via HDMI ARC and it works great, Alexa can turn the TV off and on just fine which is handy. I tuned for the room with the app and that worked great and while it is obviously best when right in front of it overall moving around the room it sounds good everywhere I need it to. I am using the bar by itself, no addon speakers. Music is fun on this and I find myself listening to music a lot more on here now and I am already wanting to start expanding my speakers! My wife loves it too now, and she is not a tech lover in general, but she really likes this and loves how it looks which is a huge win for me too!\n\nWhat needs work - Sonos, you need a $299 subwoofer to go with this! The bass is fine for general TV use I think but it could use a sub for better overall quality with music and in movie use. I will absolutely not pay $699 for the one Sonos sub that exists now. Give me a smaller $299 sub to add to this and it will then be five stars and I bet you sell a ton of them!"},{"reviewerName":"ggauze","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Working fine, but the sound is underwhelming","reviewDate":"The manufacturer commented on the review below","reviewText":"UPDATE: after trying to reset the remotes, I realized what my problem was. I was looking at the volume level indicator at TV, which was moving but the volume was not changing. To actually change volume, you need to point the remote at the Beam and ignore the volume bar on the screen - actually, remote setup in Sonos app explicitly warns about it. It is still annoying that I can't see actual volume indicator on the screen, but at least it is expected and nothing is broken and I can control the volume on Sonos with all my remotes.\nAlso, I setup Alexa again and it works now, not sure for how long.\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\nI bought Beam to use as a sound bar with my TV in the bedroom. The setup was fairly straightforward, although walking around your room pointing your phone at the corners is ridiculous and I sincerely can't believe it affects the end result, at least not in my use case of TV watching in a small room. Anyway, this is not the reason I am dissatisfied with the product.\nI have a somewhat older TV - maybe a 5-6 years old Vizio - and, unfortunately, it doesn't have a HDMI-ARC port. I had to use HDMI-to-optical adaptor to connect the Beam to my TV. After that, I set it up with 3 remotes - a TV one, a Fire TV (Amazon) one and an Apple TV one - so I can control the volume on any of these devices without having to juggle with remotes. The setup was smooth, and everything worked just fine! Until I started actually using it.\nThe volume control from the remotes was just broken. For example, I am watching FireTV and want to up the volume - I see the volume bar increasing on the TV but actual volume does not change. I take another remote, and suddenly it works. Sometimes it works only with turning the volume up, but not with turning it down. Sometimes it doesn't work with any remotes, so I need to reach for my phone, look for the Sonos app and change the volume from there, while my wife is ridiculing me for another failed tech toy.\nI tried to reset the remotes, but this option, even if present, was not obvious to find in the app. Looks like I need to reset everything, to setup Beam from scratch, to attempt to fix this problem. I tried to Google for answer, and was surprised at how many people had this or similar problems with the device. And no, I did not find the solution yet.\nThat's not it. Then, out of nowhere, Alexa stopped working on the device. It just is not there anymore. I assume I can make it work again if I set the entire thing up again, but how do I know it will not disappear again?\nAnd most annoying - I don't even hear sound improvement over my TV speakers."},{"reviewerName":"Steven Bowman","rating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"The “LAG” is real.

VERY happy with this product.\n\nProtip 1: if you are having trouble connecting with your speaker through Alexa, delete all speakers on the Alexa website (not the phone app) and reconnect. I had discovered them multiple times and it was affecting my smart switches, etc. Now they work perfectly.\n\nProtip 2: Use the Sonos app to stream the sound from your TV everywhere (i.e., sports).\n\nProtip 3: For surround sound, make sure you set up in the Sonos app for a true Dolby experience, otherwise sound will play equally from all speakers. It took a few tries to connect my existing speakers, but with new speakers I imagine it would be a more seamless experience."},{"reviewerName":"Dan","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great sound, but Alexa is quiet","reviewDate":"February 23, 2019","reviewText":"Purchased unit to go with a new TV.

Mostly interested in providing better sound for movies, but also to fill the room with music when not watching TV. I found the sound bar good enough, but the reality is I don't think it has more to give. Already I have to turn up the sound to 90% for a comfortable listening volume, anything less than that and the quiet sounds in movies are unlistenable, the loud songs are almost too loud and quickly I have turn the volume down to 80% and then again turn it up when the loud bits are done. I find it quite annoying that I have to do that manually, and the settings of \"Loudness\" and \"Night Mode\" do very little to improve when enabled. I believe adding more speakers might help with my case, that way I don't have to raise the volume too much and keep it at a comfortable 50% most of the time, but I believe is a shame that I have to add more speakers to this set up. I was hoping the Sonos Beam would be enough as it is. Maybe for smaller rooms this might be more ideal, otherwise, you'll have to add more to your kit to an already pricey $399 set up."},{"reviewerName":"Harold","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Love Sonos.

The setup was very simple. Primarily picked it up to use for TV audio as my ultra 4K sony thin bezel speakers were terrible. The good news is no more crackle but I was expecting better sound quality for TV viewing. I'll give it a few more weeks of use / setting preferences before I come to final judgement. Music on the other hand sounds marvelous. Fills my family room and is surprisingly sharp and bright. A Bit expensive for what I wanted but I like the addition for music. One note about Alexa integration. It works fine as a stand alone Alexa device, however, you can't add 3rd party speakers to a speaker group with the Alexa App. So no synchronized music across devices. I have a couple of ideas still to play out but the easy option of adding to a group isn't supported by Amazon yet."},{"reviewerName":"G.

Well, that was wrong and when I touched base with Sonos they said I would be better off with their playbar. With beam, it turned out that the sound level needed to be actually higher than with the Sony TV's audio set to dialog mode. I may just take the beam to the office as an oversized Echo device.

The vocals/dialog on the Yamaha soundbar sounded somewhat muffled and boxy to me, and I was never happy with it. The Sonos Beam is a huge improvement in that regard -- dialog is clear and natural sounding. I was worried about this when I saw how small it is, but the dialog clarity exceeded my expectations. The Sonos setup app was easy to follow and recognized their remote right away (though volume control via the TV remote only works for TV sound, not when playing music via Alexa).\n\nAmazon Alexa integration is solid, and so far has been a seamless replacement for my parents' first gen Echo. Music sounds pretty decent given the size of the Sonos Beam. Obviously there's no pounding bass, but that's the last thing they'd want. My mom played some Elvis songs, and she was over the moon."},{"reviewerName":"Shelley P","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Good speaker, improvement over TV audio, but Alexa TV control a bit primitive","reviewDate":"July 26, 2018","reviewText":"I had a Fire TV Cube on my main TV, but didn't like the TV's sound. Got the Beam because seemingly it could handle the same commands, but provide better audio.\n\nIt does provide much better audio than the TV, but the Alexa controlling is really problematic. It doesn't recognize the wake word all the time, and half the time my Echo Show in another room (blocked by a wall) will answer. It has problems turning TV on, only erratically searches for shows on something like Hulu, and you have to remember to use the full name of the TV (as defined by room name in Sonos) to turn the TV off.\n\nIt does do the audio, and the audio is an improvement. But I really had hoped for better Alexa control.\n\nPros:\n\nMuch better sound than the TV's sound\nCan play music via Alexa and other sound services\nDoes provide some Alexa control (primarily stop, play, fast forward, rewind, Go Home) but lacks sophistication I seem to get with an Echo and Fire TV, or the Cube.\nOne thing I like better about the Sonos over the Cube is if I ask it to have Alexa turn a light on or off, it doesn't pause playback like the Cube does.\nI can listen to music without having to turn TV on.\nLike the night mode\nLove the Speech Enhancement\n\nCons\n\nThe mobile app is not intuitive\nThe entire Alexa setup isn't well defined or documented.

It was meant to replace an older Bose soundbar the we had and it's a noticeable difference. The plan was to use it in our living room and it's surprisingly room filling. The bass is impressive. I know that Amazon and SONOS both recommend getting the subwoofer with this unit and it may make sense for a super large room, but no need for us.\nOur Samsung TV from 2016 has HDMI ARC connections, but for the life of me I couldn't get that work. If you look online you'll see there are some ARC/Samsung/SONOS issues and threads. It's connected via optical.\n\nForm factor is nice. It's maybe a tad taller than I expected, but fit nicely in front of our TV. Build quality, as expected from SONOS, is high.\n\nI'm not sure we're keeping the BEAM, though. The speaker needs to serve as the single speaker in our living room for music and television.\nThe issue is that you seem to have group and un-group the speaker every time you go from TV to music.\nScenario...\n- playing music and all speakers grouped together.\n- switch to TV.\n- unless you want the TV audio playing in all the speakers (which could be fun once in a while) you then have to ungroup the speakers\n- once you're finished with the TV you then have to re-group all the speakers together so that you have music in the living room and others\n\nRumor is you can use Alexa for some of this. Which isn't the point - I don't want to either have to go to the app or try to get Alexa to do something every time you go from music to TV.\n\n(now if you're thinking \"this guy wants to impossible!\" we had it working already. SONOS CONNECT running into a Bose soundbar. The Bose also had an optical-in and the speaker was smart enough to switch to TV over audio. And then back when there was no TV signal coming through. So, we may go back to that system (only issue there was the Bose times out and goes to sleep after a while so you often had to go turn it on for living room music))"},{"reviewerName":"Mark E.

I have spent thousands on other Sonos products.

In trying to make it small and versatile it just doesn’t feel like it has a distinct left and right... everything felt very centered. If they made a bit wider optional size this would be perfect.\n\nNo 5Ghz support? Still Sonos? Seriously???? Thanks for the interference from apartment neighbors.\n\nAlso, it was a big chore to figure out how to get Alexa to switch the audio input of the soundbar back to the TV from one of the music streaming services. The forums and posts from Sonos say you need to say “Alexa, switch to TV”, but this doesn’t work. When you try it, Alexa says something about “Living Room TV can’t do this”. You specifically have to say “Alexa, switch Living Room to TV” and it will work.\n\nAlso, I asked Alexa to set the volume to 10 on my TCL TV and it set it to 100... max volume at 10:30pm.

And when you use thar as a volume remote it will disconnect the Apple Express ports which then need to be (easily) reactived.\n\nThis brings back memories of a few years ago when we were struggling to sync Z-Wave Vera devices with the Alexa Smart Home app. No doubt, sometime, Sonos will tailor their app to sync with Amazon Alex music streams.\n\nMeanwhile Windows 10 had gone bonkers by taking over the stream from Pandora so it flutters abd wavers while castign to those Express Ports."},{"reviewerName":"Nazrafel","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great sound, sad I had to return it.","reviewDate":"September 11, 2018","reviewText":"I suppose I should open by saying I should have paid more attention to the type of connection the Beam requires before I bought it- if you don't have an HDMI ARC port (not just a regular HDMI port) it won't work. You might be able to connect it via the adaptor to optical audio, but this didn't work for me either. After hours of going back and forth with Sonos customer support on Twitter (since they don't have live phone customer support on weekends) I finally gave up. As just a regular speaker the sound was great- but since I couldn't get it to connect to my TV's audio- back it went. TBF, my TV is nearly 9 years old, so this was probably the equivalent of getting a high end sound system for a '95 Honda Civic- I can't really blame Sonos.

I was pretty dissapointed with the sound right out of the box but more satisified after a couple of days use. I feel you could find a contemporary pair of small bookshelf speakers that could blow it away for less. Not close to my much more expensive Quad bookshelf speakers but i thought there would be more seperation between the sonus and the ue boombox it replaced. Maybe thats because i have it mounted on a tv arm that is in the corner of the room but i also fault sonos there as it has no room adjustment feature like is standard in other brands av audio equipment.\n\nAlexa support is terrible. Like other \"supported\" alexa third party devices, you can't change its wake up word and many basic features,like calling, are not available. So if you are a big alexa user you will also need a true alexa device in the room which makes not being able to change the sonus wake word very frustrating. And yet another kick in the face is that it thinks it is over a hundred miles away from where i am and the alexa app is unable to change its location. So just to get my local weather i have to leave the room to use other alexa devices so the sonos does not buttin with wrong info.\n\nStrongly suggest to not be on the bleeding edge of expensive alexa enabled devices.

I bought this to replace an old, wired, 5:1 setup in by bedroom. The sound of the Beam could be best described as balanced. I never feel like I'm getting too much of one frequency. Depending on what you're watching, you can adjust the bass and the treble in the settings. For example, I watched Star Wars Ep. VI on blu-ray and I had to turn the bass up about to really feel the roar of the fighters. I have tried out the speech setting that is supposed to make it easier to hear dialogue and it works well, but I never felt like I needed it. I intend, in the near future, to purchase two Play 1s to create a more surrounding experience. The sub does not feel like something I need or would want for this product because I would never use a soundbar this small in a room larger than a bedroom or small living room. If you're looking for something that can vibrate the floor, you should look elsewhere. I have a pretty diverse musical taste and have tested numerous styles of music over the past week. I would say that the Beam's weakest point is rap music with exceptionally low bass, which is to be expected considering the lack of a sub. However, more balanced music like Radiohead, Kids See Ghosts, Frank Ocean, and Tame Impala really shined. Post hardcore rock managed to keep driving and keep its clarity in the guitars which can become muddy with some systems. Classical and jazz music feels delightfully refined. As far as the software, I believe it to be the strong point of Sonos. It may turn some off being that it is a mostly closed ecosystem, but there is a system they sell that allows you to connect other speakers to the ecosystem if you'd like. The set up was seamless and if you have an iOS device, you can fine tune the Beam to the dimensions of your room in the settings. The integration of Alexa is welcoming. If you connect via ARC, you can control your television's volume and turn it on and off with your voice. It is really responsive as well and easily hears me from across the room with the volume near the maximum.\n\nOverall I highly recommend this product looking to upgrade the sound in a bedroom or a small living room. If you're looking to build or add to a Sonos ecosystem then it's a no brainer. This is my first, but definitely not my last Sonos speaker."},{"reviewerName":"Bryce Kerr","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great soundbar","reviewDate":"August 26, 2018","reviewText":"I was looking for a quality soundbar, and chose this based on the Sonos reputation.

I'd been looking for a soundbar for some time, I'd actually bought a Sony one last year which had a noticeable delay between the sound and the image on screen - I couldn't live with it and returned it. This soundbar, has no lag between my Sony Bravia TV.\n\nSOUND\n\nThe sound is clear and there is some decent Bass to it as well. However, I find it needs to be turned up pretty loud to be heard. For example, when I just used my TV's internal speakers, I'd be fine with 15-20 on the volume button. The Sonos has to get up to 40 to get that same sound, but when using Netflix it needs to be up to 50 to get an audible level of sound. Switching from Netflix back to TV results in the TV now being too loud at 50, needing a quick turn down, but it is a bit slow to change. It's frustrating, because the quality of sound is pretty good.\n\nIRRITATION\n\nThe beam was supposed to fit seamlessly under the TV, but with my Sony TV - it's too tall, and blocks the remote receiver! Therefore we are going to have to purchase some kind of panel to sit the TV on top of in order for us to be able to use the TV without angling our arms above our heads!!\n\nAlso, we used the app to connect another Play3 speaker to play the TV sound at the same time - however on this other speaker the sound from the TV is intermittent and tends to drop in and out randomly throughout a programme. So I've stopped using the Beam in conjunction with any other speakers.\n\nOVERALL\n\nDecent sound; but irritating that volume needs to be different between TV / DVR/ Netflix - whereas my TV's internal speaker didn't have this issue.\nPerfect synchronisation between image and sound, unlike some soundbars which suffer with lag that makes you feel like you're watching a Dubbed Movie.\nIt doesn't fit in front of Sony TV's without blocking the remote receiver.\n\n(Can't comment on Alexa as I don't use that function!)"},{"reviewerName":"DocBrownBear","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Five Stars","reviewDate":"July 18, 2018","reviewText":"Perfect for our Apt living room."},{"reviewerName":"Manny","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Hold off on this one","reviewDate":"September 17, 2018","reviewText":"The output is only hdmi no audio jack or optical port"},{"reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Be careful Alexa is not available everywhere!","reviewDate":"September 8, 2018","reviewText":"I bought this Sonos because it has Alexa integrated, but struck by the fact that it is available only in selected countries and my country is not on the list!!

There's a 3.1 set, 5.1 set, 5.0 set, etc... When there's a .1, you get a subwoofer. I only got the Beam, which costs $400.\n\n- There is no Bluetooth. It uses the Wifi network.\n\n- Since it's Alexa-enabled, you can control it with your voice.\n\n- It also works with Apple's AirPlay.\n\n- The set-up is easy. Download the Sonos app, connect Beam to your TV, then follow the app instructions.\n\n- If you have a HUGE room, you should buy Playbar or Sonos PLAYBASE Wireless Soundbar for Home Theater and Streaming Music (Black) (which have twice the number of amplifiers). The Beam is best for medium-sized rooms. I'd stick with Beam. If you need to fill up a room, get the other speakers and link them together digitally.\n\n- Dimensions: 25.6 x 2.7 x 3.9 inches\n\n- Item Weight 6.35 pounds\n\n- You to connect the HDMI cable (which is included) to your TV\n\n- Sonos Beam supports Dolby Digital 5.1, Dolby Digital 2.0, and PCM stereo - and nothing beyond that.\n\n- It does NOT work with Google Assistant YET. It should work with it by Xmas 2018.\n\n- It has a universal power supply.\n\nOverall, I'm pleased with it and I recommend it."},{"reviewerName":"P.

Sonos software is incredible, and is worth buying for entry into the Sonos world. My Playbar is connected to our main TV, and my Beam is connected to our bedroom TV.\nI actually think the dialogue clarity is better on the Beam. Maybe it’s the smaller room.\n\nI am using optical on the Beam. Several reasons. I had trouble getting the HDMI to work on my Samsung. My bedroom TV, a 50 inch Samsung, only has two HDMI ports. I need one for my satellite and one for my Roku. Sonos provides a connector that makes the optical connection seamless. I had an HDMI connection on my Sony 9000. It has an HDMI in and an out port. My satellite went through that to the TV. That left my Roku going straight to the TV and I lost the benefit of the speaker with Roku. To me optical is the most trouble free connection. The sound from any device goes through the speaker. Very happy with optical on both my Playbar and Beam.\n\nFor those not having a Sonos, and being apprehensive about not getting a remote, be thankful. Your phone, or your tablet is the best remote possible. It shows every music service available, and makes searching for any song, or radio station, or genre so easy, and so complete.\n\nSonos as a Wi FI device. Wi Fi is so much better for your soundbar than Bluetooth, including Airplay 2. I like music when I fall asleep. I select a radio station or loop songs, and shut my phone down. The music plays all night without diminishing my battery. Cannot do this with Bluetooth or Airplay. Songs don’t get interrupted. It does not make a difference on your TV.\n\nAirplay 2 is Bluetooth equivalent. The Sonos website gives very simple directions. I started my google play song, swiped up on my IPhone, hit the same type of icon, right above the song, that shows on You Tube. For those that don’t know, there is an icon on top of the You Tube screen that allows to watch You Tube on your TV. I also used Airplay 2 to connect You Tube music to my TV. Works easily.\n\nThe Beam is compact, has big sound, great clarity, and you control volume, or pause, by just saying Alexa.\nI do not have a Sonos sub or surround with either system.\n\nI can’t imagine any competing systems in this price range, being comparable in value.\nI think this leaves Bose as an afterthought."},{"reviewerName":"GDLR","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Sonos","reviewDate":"October 11, 2018","reviewText":"Sometimes it unlinks from the app-control."},{"reviewerName":"Ted H.","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Doesn't work well with ARC output","reviewDate":"July 18, 2018","reviewText":"I really like its concept.\nIt's compact while reasonable in price, and generates good surrounding sounds.\nI bought one beam and two play:1 to make a surrounding system.\nWhile they connected to my iPhone, everything was good.\nHowever, while connecting to my LG TV, the situation is different.\nI found the sound comes about 0.1 seconds later than images.\nEspecially when I turned on my PS4, the sound delay was obvious.\nThe delay was fixed after I gave up the ARC output and use optical sound connector but I'd use a direct connect but a adaptor for beam."},{"reviewerName":"Taps","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Impressed!!!","reviewDate":"July 17, 2018","reviewText":"I am not ok with being told all along airplay2 will work across all speakers and was really hoping for a playbar upgrade.....\n\nJust picked up my Sonos beam.

So I was pretty excited to see a smaller option than the Playbar. Overall a nice product but sound wise I think I'd prefer a pair of 1's or a 5. I'd say it's a wash. But with all the focus around Alexa now with Sonos I have to say it actually hurts the value of the speaker b/c the integration is problematic. Since a key feature of this speaker has to be disabled I have to mark this down quite a bit to two stars.\n\nYes, Alexa works well on the speaker itself. And overall it's nifty to be able to call out music to specific rooms. The problem comes in when you have multiple rooms using Sonos and multiple users. For example... if you have the Beam in your office and are listening to music while someone in another room of your house asks an Echo Dot \"alexa, what's the weather?\" your Beam will mute audio playback while it answers in the other room. If you are listening to your Play5's in the kitchen and you have kids in their room asking Alexa a million questions, your audio playback mutes every time. Alexa and Sonos have the implementation concept called Ducking which trims the volume so Alexa can hear what you're saying/asking - totally makes sense in the room where your asking the question. Problem is, it's not room aware so if your Sonos and Alexa systems are integrated, playback across all rooms is interrupted with any Alexa query in any other room. It's annoying as all get out. Been a problem for 8 or more months and no acknowledgement from Sonos other than to say \"thanks for feature requests.\" Personally we're going to decouple Alexa completely from Sonos b/c usage by family members around the house make Sonos non-usable."},{"reviewerName":"Zach K.","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"The vocals are crisp, the bass is tight, and the appearance is sharp.","reviewDate":"July 19, 2018","reviewText":"I prefer a heavier music style centering around Dubstep and Electronic, so my assumptions of this bar were that it would struggle to play artists like Datsik or Excision. I know this bar has limited range and power abilities with the size of the speakers, but I was impressed beyond my doubts. The bass was also very nicely replicated given the size of this bar. I am getting some quality hits from the small woofers in this bar, hits that I would expect out of an 8\", circular-coned subwoofer. Again, the woofers are not overpowering, but they are there and they do a great job. I will be picking up a Sonos Sub to help bring those lower notes out to play more, but this bar really does a great job with keeping a clean quality front he lower frequencies.\n\nNot to mention, I like how nice the white color Beam looks on a deep, deep mahogany-red shelf. It's a nice contrast on a darker shelf, but placing it on a solid white shelf will also make this bar fit in with an artistic taste.\n\nOverall, it's a great bar for the price.

We were in the market for bluetooth speakers that could connect to eachother for a broader, yet portable music experience. Apparently, Sonos comes up as a search results list when \"bluetooth\" is the search term. Oops! Completely not at all Bluetooth capable without extra equipment and tweaking.\nConnected it directly to TV, went through the app setup (annoying busywork, but whatever we're smart enough to figure it out). Cool, sounds alright, not bumping, but alright. We don't have the SUB so no big deal.\nEven TRYING hard to be optimistic, comes punch #2:\n\"Hey lets turn off our router to see if we can at least get sound with direct connection.\"\nNO> dig around Sonos website for explanation or workaround, \"No. Sonos is not designed to work without a broadband Internet connection and a router.\"\nThis device is clearly for people that love the restrictiveness. Does not play well with anyone, especially not without internet. Hmm reminds me of another product only worse. Its a speaker, nothing else. The Alexa part we could care less about. We own two echos we never use.\nI hardly blame anyone as it's a gift and very generous. I must say for the price, I am completely and totally shocked this product ONLY works with an internet connection. There is no way in gods green earth we would have spent our own money on this considering we do not get strong wi-fi or even consistent internet reliability in our area. I have no idea why if the Beam is connected directly to the TV with a cable why the internet should even have to be an option. Extremely poor concept & execution on the company's part. I wonder how many others were fooled into making a purchase to realize, this was literally an internet only device. I have a hard time understanding why versatility in their products would not be seen as desirable on their part. Oh well. We have it connected in the room with the strongest internet connection. I like the sound, it's better than just the TV sounds so I will give it 3 stars for that. I feel duped for our family that honestly thought when they searched amazon for Bluetooth that this would work. HUMAN error, just disappointed it cost them this much for something we STILL have to find an alternate product for.\n\nWe will use it, but now are stuck either buying more worthless SONOS equipment we can't take with us when traveling as we thought.

(If you decide to run cables through the wall, check out the awesome Brush Face Plates that work with a standard hole saw on this page.)\n\nIf I hadn't run cables through the wall, the TV + this sound bar would have been setup in about 30-40 minutes.\n\nWhen you connect this to your TV, be sure to use the HDMI ARC port so the sound bar can automatically get sound from the TV. (What a great technology!) In addition, the Sonos Beam can control the TV through the same cable so you won't even need a remote (for the most part) once you figure out the voice commands.\n\nThe result of this efficient cable setup is that I have a total of 3 cables:\n\n- A power cable for the TV\n\n- A power cable for the Sonos\n\n- An HDMI cable to connect them (This cable was included with the Sonos Beam)\n\nOn my TV I did have to adjust the settings to turn TV audio off and enable CEC control (so the Sonos could send commands). The Sonos mobile app will walk you through making those required setting changes.\n\n[*** Software Setup ***]\n\nOnce everything was mounted I started setting up the software; and, although everything seemed to be setup, I couldn't get Alexa to turn on or control the connected TV.\n\nIt was weird because the sound bar would respond to commands (even going as far as saying it was starting my book or turning on the TV) - but then nothing happened. Pretty much every command did that: 'Turn on the TV', 'Read my audio book', 'Listen to music', etc...\n\nFinally, I realized I had to go into the Alexa app and add the Fire TV and Sonos Sound Bar into my smart home - then it started working. This probably should have been obvious sooner except that it was responding like it was already setup.\n\n[*** Sound Quality ***]\n\nFor my purposes in a workout room, the sound is amazing!\n\nDon't expect it to compete with a high-dollar audio system; but, I don't think it's meant to. It does blow the TV speakers completely out of the water and fills the room with high quality sound.\n\n[*** Functionality ***]\n\nNow that it's working, I can honestly say I'm impressed. This sound bar is intuitive to use by voice command (Thanks Alexa!), and sounds great.\n\nWe have several people in that room that use it in different ways:\n\n- I like to listen to audio books from Audible, which are easy to start and stop on the Sonos using Alexa.\n\n- My wife watches TV and can control it easily using her voice.\n\n- My teenage daughter listens to music and it also sounds great and fills the room.\n\nThis Sonos Beam is a perfect companion to the Fire TV that's mounted above it!\n\nNow that we have this working, I'm going to setup the ceiling fan and light to work with Alexa using a Bond (Found Here) so the room will be fully automated. :)\n\n[*** Conclusion ***]\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend the Sonos Beam!\n\nThe inclusion of Alexa for voice control was a stroke of genius; so you'll not only get great sound - but a lot of additional functionality that makes it an amazing addition to a TV."},{"reviewerName":"Matt","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"HDMI ARC SOLUTION","reviewDate":"August 15, 2018","reviewText":"The quality is good and it has potential to be an easy set up but I was one of the many that had issues getting the hdmi arc connection to work.

I’ve been a long time Sonos user, with Play:3 and Play:1 speakers around my home for years, within the last six months, I acquired Sonos Ones due to the smart features, and a Sonos Sub to add low end impact to a pair of Sonos Ones in an entertainment area. Recently I decided to redecorate and that meant moving my large, high quality ($5000 or so) home theater system that had been in the living room to the newly created man cave. I still wanted competent sound in the living room, so I decided to add the Beam to the Sonos speakers I already owned, to create a 5.1 system. Well the receiver, large towers, center channel and fairly large surround speakers are gone from this space but 80-90 percent of the sound quality remains. This small four unit sound system has replaced a large Pioneer Elite receiver and Focal sound system that retailed for significantly more money with a negligible reduction in sound quality. Sound playing video games or movies is nearly on par with my former system, it’s only during critical listening with music that this amazing system does not quite get there. The Beam, at the heart of a $1400 system provides all the sound quality 90% of listeners would ever require, it’s better for movies and games than music, a Playbar based system would most likely be a touch better musically, but I am astounded at the overall sound quality, and ease of use of this product, and I am very picky about both sound quality and ergonomics. It works great with my Sony 4K TV, using ARC any of the connected devices sound output are routed through the Sonos system, with our previous setup, despite a Harmony remote and Alexa Voice control, there were sometimes some disconnect where the receiver’s input would not line up with the selected function and would cause frustration, but now without fail, I get what I expect. Kudos to Sonos for creating a product that is well built, easy to use, and while it’s not the end all as far as sound quality goes, it’s a $400 multi-talented speaker that blends superbly in to decor, and will satisfy 90% or more of users desire for sound quality."},{"reviewerName":"Power User","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Doubtful at first but now love it","reviewDate":"August 31, 2018","reviewText":"Looked at reviews and bought Sonos Beam and Bose soundbar to try both at home.

Plus the Beam is true Alexa built in, not just compatible, so we moved the Echo box up to our bedroom (saving us $90). Have had no problems with Alexa in the Beam - does everything it did on the Echo. The Beam was also amazingly easy to set up vs the Bose. We later added 2 Play:1 sonos speakers to fill the room even more for listening to music. Fantastic and is even a full surround sound system for movies.

Way better than the built in speakers but not as nice as I would have liked. Then I researched....and discovered something that changed the whole enchilada.....\n\nI discovered that although there is no optical input they include with it a \"Beam Optical Adapter\" which has the male optical connector on one side and a female HDMI on the other. I found this out by chance looking for an adapter that did just that. So I stopped and bought the Beam.\n\nBesides that, I was also concerned about the volume control which I didn't see any documentation on either....and it basically learns and finds your TV remote automatically during setup.\n\nSo I was able to successfully use the optical audio out on my TV and my existing remote to control volume....setup in under 5-min since I already had other Sonos speakers.\n\nI then snarfed two other Play 1's for surround that I was using elsewhere....and in in under 15-min all setup and working like a champ.\n\nAnd so far, no sub but that is next.

Krumpe","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Beautiful sound, but a bit glitchy","reviewDate":"August 14, 2018","reviewText":"We thought we were happy with the sound output of our family room TV. But after adding the Sonos Beam... wow! Video games, movies, and everything just sounds so much better. I don't have any other Sonos devices yet, so I cannot comment on how it works in a larger Sonos ecosystem, but I can highly recommend this even if it is your only smart speaker in the house.\n\nSetup was easy because my TV (a couple years old) has an HDMI-ARC output. Yours probably has one too if it's newer TV. Take a look at all the HDMI ports on your TV and find out for yourself whether you have one. If you don't, you can use the supplied optical audio cable, which most TVs support.\n\nBecause this is a Sonos device, part of the setup will include connecting it to your network. I went with a WiFi connection, but you can opt for a wired connection if your router is nearby. The Sonos app has been fine tuned to make setup easy (I used the app on an Android phone). That process went smoothly. And, I know there are ways to use the app to tweak the device, but pretty much I don't touch the app anymore.\n\nHere's what I love: it connects to my Fire TV device so that I can control what I watch with my voice without needing to touch the remote control. \"Alexa, show me movies starring Ben Stiller\" and it just works. Getting the connectivity working between the Sonos Beam and the Fire TV is a little less straightforward than just installing the Beam, and will require some tweaking in Amazon's Alexa app in order to pair the two devices. But once it's set up, it works quite well.\n\nNote there are some quirks to get used to. If I say \"What's the weather?\" into the Fire TV remote, the forecast shows up on my TV screen. But if I ask the Sonos Beam the same question, I get only a spoken forecast. It would be nice if the Beam and the Fire TV coordinated their tasks a little better since they are paired. In other words, I would like the same behavior whether I speak a phrase into the Beam or the Fire remote. Perhaps the integration will be better in the future.\n\nA couple complaints that might matter to you:\n* There are glitches. Occasionally, the sound just dropped out momentarily while watching something on TV. I think this was a software issue, but it was noticeable. Another time, I could not get any sound to come out of the Beam while watching TV until I repeatedly cycled through the inputs on my TV. I guess somehow the input-cycling nudged the Sonos Beam to wake up and start playing the audio from my TV show. The nice thing about Sonos is that the device automatically will download updates. So, problems I am experiencing will (hopefully) be resolved in a future version of the software.\n\n* Ok...this is minor, but noticeable. I have a lot of Alexa-enabled devices. This is the only one that, in response to the phrase \"Alexa\", makes an audible chime. It is distracting, and sometimes throws me off when I'm asking Alexa something. Like...do I need to wait until the chime is done? Or can I talk over the chime? There is apparently no way to turn off this sound, and digging through support forums on Sonos' website suggests that people have been complaining about this for a while, and Sonos does not seem to care about the issue. Truly, it's minor, but irritating nonetheless.\n\nI love that I can listen to music using the Beam, or use it as my TV's audio output. I love that I can check the weather. I love that I can add items to my shopping list, or add appointments to my calendar. It's really a great, versatile device with wonderful sound."},{"reviewerName":"KyleNakamura","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Underwhelming sound quality and frustrating using with Samsung QLED TV","reviewDate":"March 23, 2019","reviewText":"I returned my Sonos Beam for a refund mainly due to its poor integration with my Samsung Q6 series TV and for its underwhelming sound quality.\n\n---------\nCons:\n\nIt has underwhelming sound quality. Even with bass turned up, I think the Echo sounds better. I'm a bit of an audiophile and comparing it to my JBL LSR305 speakers made me feel embarrassed for Sonos. It had fairly good separation of channels (stereo audio sounds like it's coming from far left or far right of the screen), but that's about all it has going for it.\n\nIt is frustrating using it with Samsung QLED TV because the TV, for whatever reason, refuses to use any other audio source if the Sonos speaker is plugged in using HDMI. This is fine most of the time, but you'll have to unplug the Sonos if you want to listen using bluetooth headphones or even the TV's built in speakers.\n\nThe Alexa integration is incomplete. The Alexa in the Sonos can only answer about half of the queries that a regular Alexa device can answer. The Sonos can't seem to control certain smart devices or set an alarm, or other random tasks that you might need an assistant for.\n\nThere's been no word on Google Assistant integration. I doubt it's going to happen in the first half of 2019 which was their expected schedule.\n\nThe minimum volume is far too loud. Even at the lowest setting, it is loud enough to wake up other people in your house. Good thing the bass is underwhelming or else it would probably wake up your neighbors in an apartment.\n\nPros:\n\nExcellent build quality.\n\nLooks nice and fits perfectly under a wide-stance flat screen TV. Any Vizio, Samsung, or LG above 55\" will easily fit this TV underneath; just make sure your TV has wide feet and not a center-mounted base that would be in the way of the sound bar. The white color can look a little tacky and old-fashioned in some (maybe most) homes, but it was cheaper than the black and looked good enough if I tucked it far enough under the TV. Black is just way better as it disappears from view.\n\nStereo audio is wide and fills a room. It occasionally surprised me to hear audio from waaay off screen, which was not expected from a device sitting in the center of my TV.\n\nThe Echo microphone works surprisingly well. I think it might pick up audio as well or better than a regular Echo device, like the Echo or Echo Dot... and those devices have 4 times as many microphones. Pretty impressive!"},{"reviewerName":"M.

This does come with a caveat, though. I'm not taking off any stars but I do want to explain:\n\nIf you simply hook it up the way Sonos describes, there is a good chance you will only get stereo sound or mediocre virtual surround instead of Dolby Digital. Even TV's that output DD from their internal tuners will very often not be able to pass a DD signal through if the source is coming in from another device (say via HDMI). There's tons of confusion over this and TV makers are typically not clear about this limitation. Neither is Sonos, until you start to wade into their forums. My advice, if you want DD, is not to assume anything about your TV. You will have to test it with a known DD source, and Sonos does helpfully tell you if it's seeing stereo or DD. Currently you find it in the app under more:settings:about my Sonos system and look for \"audio in\". If, like me, your TV failed this test your options are to bypass the TV with SPDIF from the source, an HDMI audio extractor, or an HDMI switch with audio out (in the case of multiple sources). It's not that hard once you see what is going on, but it's a nuisance. However, one last caveat to the caveat: even once you find a way to bypass that works in your setup, your source, or in some cases your extractor/switch, needs an option to avoid or convert DTS (common for Blue-ray). The Beam does not decode DTS, which is another oversight."},{"reviewerName":"IlPrimitivo","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Rich Deep Sound But Has Alexa Issues","reviewDate":"August 22, 2018","reviewText":"The Sonos Beam sound bar would be a nice addition to any television set up providing rich deep sound in an attractive unobtrusive and well-designed package. The integration of Amazon Alexa makes it highly useful in a modern digital home with very good voice response and coverage -- at times better response than the Echo and Dots I already have. The sound quality of the Beam is certainly better than the native Amazon devices and has no problem filling a room with music. That being said, adding a sub would fill in the deep bass range where the Beam just can't reach.\n\nSetup requires a download of the Sonos app to your phone where all adjustments are made. Connectivity was relatively seamless but I did have problems with the initial software update and the configuration of the Beam. After a few tries, including a power down of both the Beam and my wi-fi router, the Beam finally connected and I was able to configure and link it to my Amazon Alexa account. It took an additional while, and a couple of tries, to finally get the Beam to recognize my playlists and home automation routines.\n\nConnectivity to the television is made using an HDMI ARC cable which is provided. There is also an Optical adapter provided in case your television does not have HDMI ARC. Both cable and adapter should provide connectivity for current and future TV and components.\n\nI would recommend better documentation and less reliance on the software configuring itself. Messages telling me that my Alexa account cannot be connected is fine but leaves me little to work with when trying to fix the problem.\n\nBeing able to attach the Beam to the wall without the need to purchase an expensive bent-metal bracket would also be nice.\n\nThe Beam is a well thought out piece of equipment that provides good sound at a moderate price point. Having Alexa integrated into the sound bar increases it's functionality dramatically and makes it more of a household device than just a piece of sound equipment.\n\nSetup was relatively smooth -- as these things go -- but troubleshooting documentation could be better as well as clearer set-up instructions through the app. A built-in wall bracket would have been very handy and not seen as an attempt to nickle & dime their customer base. Sound is good with deep rich tomes. A sub would make the experience better.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\nUpdate 09/20/2018\n\nGetting frustrated with the Sonos Alexa compatibility and connectivity. The Sonos seems to be dropping it's Alexa connection about 1/3 the time which leads it to being unreliable. So unreliable, in fact, that I've had to reconnect my Echo Dot so that I could operate my smart switches and lights.

No doubt."},{"reviewerName":"E. F. Panighetti","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Smart Sound","reviewDate":"August 3, 2018","reviewText":"The Beam is the newest Soundbar from Sonos. It's smaller than the original Soundbar, simpler to connect and adds Alexa voice integration and Apple Airplay 2.\n\nLike other Sonos speakers, sound is rich and clear. Through the controller app, there's a room specific calibration, EQ, night mode and voice enhancement settings. It does, as expected, produce a much richer sound than the TV speakers. It has four woofers and one tweeter.\n\nAs a member of the Sonos system, the soundbar can optionally be paired with a Sonos subwoofer and a pair of Sonos speakers (Play:1 or Sonos One) as surround speakers. In this set up all the speakers work together in a group like a single system.\n\nAirplay 2 allows to use the whole Sonos system in addition to grouping Apple TVs (4 or newer) to play music from any app on iOS or macOS.\n\nConnecting it requires a power cable and HDMI 'ARC' from a TV: Most newer TVs have a single HDMI connector that's designated 'ARC' (Audio Return Channel), so whatever audio comes with the video on the TV is transmitted back through this port. Additionally the speaker can turn on or off the TV and the TV can control the volume via the CEC signal that’s transmitted via the same HDMI cable. The drawback is that this uses one of the few HDMI inputs on the TV.\nThe 2017 model TV we're using the Beam with has 4 HDMI ports, but only two of these are 4K, ad one of these two is the ARC port (HDMI 2 in our case). So there is only one HDMI 4K port left that's where we have an AppleTV.\nSonos Beam also has an alternative connection adapter that takes an optical audio input, found in most TVs (TOSLINK) and connects to the HDMI input on the speaker. The soundbar won't be able to turn the TV on or off (via Alexa) with this system.\nThe Beam also has an infrared receiver that learns the volume commands from the TV remote.\n\nBecause of this excellent integration, it doesn't have a separate remote control. It just works with either the TV's remote of the AppleTV remote in our case (The AppleTV uses the HDMI CEC connection to get the volume controls across).\n\nSetting up the Beam requires a phone or tablet: Download the app, start it, and then press the pairing button on the Beam, and within seconds it connected, asked for WiFi connection and was set up. It didn't require the phone to pair with a temporary WiFi network like other speakers do. It's very simple to do. In my experience simpler than setting up the Echo or other speakers.\n\nThe Soundbar doesn't have a Bluetooth connection like other speakers do, but the Sonos system is fantastic. It connects to every single music provider I could think of, including Apple Music (Not just Airplay 2 but native integration), Spotify, Pandora, Google Play, Internet radio, Plex, etc. Also, if using iOS, Airplay 2 is a better choice than Bluetooth.\n\nThen there is Alexa integration. While it's not the same as an Echo device (It's an 'Alexa enabled device'), it does pretty much anything an Echo does but doesn't currently support communications, drop ins or announcements, also doesn't join Echo music groups, although I can tell an Echo speaker to play music on the Sonos. Also, and this is different than other Echo speakers: When it wakes up with the Alexa keyword and is listening to a command it plays a chime. This is to announce that it's listening, but Echo devices don't do this and I initially found it very distracting, although after a week got used to it.\nNote that while voice with Alexa can control a Sonos playlist, if asking Alexa to play something it works like Echo devices, as it plays from the music sources configured in the Alexa App.\n\nThere are four touch-sensitive buttons (not physical buttons, they're part of the surface, touch sensitive): Volume up/down, play/pause and mic button. There is a small white light for the mic button and a small light for the play button that changes color/intensity depending on what it's doing. It's quite faint and not distracting.\n\nThe Soundbar itself is quite compact, and while it's primarily designed to be sitting on a TV stand, it can also be wall-mounted, but the wall mount is extra. I'm disappointed that the wall mount didn't come with it because it doesn't use standard mounts. Sonos sells a custom wall mount for the Beam and a 3rd party mount to use as an under-cabinet speaker. The mount was quite expensive although I'm impressed how well it's made. It's a thick metal piece. The mounting holes fit like a glove, it has a felt backing so it doesn't mar the wall and is very simple to install either between beams or with anchors."},{"reviewerName":"BBP","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Alexa is our favorite feature","reviewDate":"August 5, 2018","reviewText":"We are in love with this Sonos Beam sound bar! We can now hear music and sounds we never heard before from the TV's tiny speakers. It's transformed our TV watching (and music listening) experience. Music now fills the family room, and we have to turn the sound bar down to half the volume that the TV was set to! Bass is heavy and thumping, but that's what Americans seem to like. Sesame Street has never sounded so good! (We have a 2 year old.)\n\nThe built-in Alexa feature is simply fantastic! That is a huge selling point for us, because we are a heavily automated household and have an Echo or Dot in almost every room of the house. This is our most fancy Alexa yet (7 now, counting the Sonos)! Once you set it up and enable all the permissions, it functions exactly like Amazon's stand-alone Echo products as far as voice control and music content. I have not tried the \"drop in\" feature on it yet. I don't know if it's not compatible, or if I've not found how to set it up yet. For sound optimization, the Beam can use your smart phone to listen to the calibration tones. No more clumsy Denon Audyssey Sound Calibration Microphone - Specifically for AVRX2100W, AVR-X2100W, AVRX3000, AVR-X3000, AVRX3100W, AVR-X3100W, AVRX4000, AVR-X4000!\n\nHardware set up is very easy, though there are lots of steps needed to set up the app and all services. It took me about 15 minutes to download the Sonos app and get hooked up. Surprisingly, the app found my home network and didn't even ask for my password! That's smart! I love Sonos' attention to detail and even the smallest touches are lovingly designed. For example, the power cord has a rounded contour to it, similar to Macbook Pro Power Adapter Extension Cord Wall Cord Cable for Apple Mac Ibook Macbook Pro US 3 Prong. The box is entirely cardboard, as well as the inserts. Only a few small plastic pouches are the non-recyclables in the packaging.\n\nThe Beam is currently hooked up to an old-ish Samsung SmartTV and works great with Samsung remote to control the volume (but there's no onscreen indicator)! Newer TVs have HDMI ARC (Audio Return Channel) which enables two-way communications over a single cable. If you don't have this, no worries. You will need to use the included SPDIF to HDMI adapter. Still only 1 wire from your TV to the Beam.\n\nWe have another soundbar (Onkyo LS-B50 6.1-Channel 3D Sound Bar), but don't like it because it takes up so much room and it's only Bluetooth enabled, not WIFI. It was a pain to wake back up from Bluetooth sleep mode. The Sonos is eons more advanced, but to be fair, the Onkyo is about 5 years older, and in tech industry terms, that's basically like a century.\n\nI just love the low profile design! It's elegant and beautiful to look at, like a piece of contemporary art almost, unlike my massive eyesore of an Onkyo bar. The top of the Sonos is flat, and I can even put some small mini-figures on it for decoration. It does get a little warm in the back because it has to be on and listening for the Alexa wake word continuously.\n\nThe Sonos Beam is fantastic.

This is a small soundbar, but it feels heavier than it looks - always a good sign with small speakers. Even if this is your first Sonos product, you’ll find the setup is a simple process. The Sonos app walks you through it step-by-step. Within a few minutes, you’re done. If you’re not into the gadgety aspects of the Sonos product line and just want an excellent speaker in a small package, the Beam can do that for you. Once you get the basic setup done, you don’t need to open the Sonos app again if you don’t want to. And none of the Alexa stuff is necessary if you’re not interested in that.\n\nI’m using the Beam in a fairly small family room. This is our primary entertainment space, and the Beam is serving as our only audio source for TV, movies, and music. We do not have any other Sonos products in this space, so the Beam has to fend for itself without the support of a subwoofer or rear channel speakers. I am using the it to replace a standard AV receiver with a good pair of bookshelf speakers. This setup left much to be desired for TV, and the Beam delivers the excellent center channel performance I was missing. It makes dialog dramatically clearer and easy to distinguish from background sounds and music. I had considered adding a center channel speaker to my old setup, but the Beam allows me to condense the entire audio system into a package that’s the size of that one speaker. That’s a big plus for a small space.\n\nWhile the excellent center channel is the Beam’s greatest strength, it also has enough bass to provide convincing sound effects for movies. The rumbles and explosions it delivers in the opening battle sequence of Star Wars: The Last Jedi are powerful enough to keep me engrossed. If you want to have the walls shaking when you watch movies, you’ll need to add the subwoofer. Personally, I’m pleased with the Beam as it is. The subwoofer would be icing on the cake, but it’s hard for me to justify $700 icing on a $400 cake.\n\nFor music, the Beam is an amazing performer, especially music with a focus on the vocals. Crosby, Stills, & Nash sound like they’re singing from my atop my TV stand. Jazz is another strong point for the Beam, and it conveys the full power of John Coltrane’s My Favorite Things. It’s also good for classic rock, including challenging tunes like Queen’s Bohemian Rhapsody. The only time the Beam disappointed me was with Beethoven’s 9th, but it’s a bit unreasonable to expect such a small speaker to convey the full breadth of that aural experience. The Beam punches way above its weight, but it’s still subject to the laws of physics. With a subwoofer to handle the heaviest lifting, it might even be up to the challenge of the 9th Symphony. I’m just afraid that nearly tripling the overall investment would undermine the solid value proposition that the Beam offers."},{"reviewerName":"N.

Once we moved our lack of sound was evident, and we decided we really needed a sound bar. I kind of leaped before I looked with this one, our tv did not have the hdmi arc or optical needed. However one inexpensive adapter later I was able to get it all set up. The app walked me through a very fast setup, and even helped me sync our cable remote so we can use it for volume control. The difference from our regular TV speakers is night and day, at a low volume we can hear every word said and every background sound. We quickly set up Alexa, and music streaming. The sound is excellent and overall my family could not be happier."},{"reviewerName":"J.

So... the beam was okay, and it worked with my TV, and it sounded good. But after a few weeks, maybe more, I started listening with a bit more critical ear and the center, right/left was pretty weak, especially with the sub/surrounds. It’s just not a match, weak and thin... it might be GREAT for someone upgrading from tv speakers, but if you want better sound, then spend the money on the Playbase if it fits yours space... the sound is night and day, yes, for nearly double the price, so I still consider the beam a great speaker, it all depends on what you really want from your sound setup."},{"reviewerName":"Fast39","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Not as good as I thought...","reviewDate":"December 2, 2018","reviewText":"I bought the Beam on black Friday for 349. It was a great deal, 50.00 off for sonos that hardly go on sale. I have a playbar in my living room with the sub and two sonos 1's for surround, and planned on using this in the bedroom with a sub and two play 1's as rear surround.\nMy friend installed a beam and two play1's as surround, and I went for a listen. It has a ting sound, and was just not close to the playbar. I get that it's half price, but after listening to the playbar, this was a disappointment. There is a videos on youtube that go back and forth from the playbar and the beam, and the difference is enough for me to stay with the playbar. I had a polk audio sound bar and sub in the room previous, and it sounded great. I was expecting to sound better than that, and it didn't. There are better systems out there for the 350 and then adding in the 300 for the play 1's. I could live without the sub, but with it on sale for 599, it was Christmas for me.\n\nI really like sonos in the fact that wires are no longer a thing. For the price, you can get a nice wired receiver, speakers and a sub. For me, I have dogs that I didn't want to trip all over the wires. I could've ran the wires in the basement and then back up, but that is just too much work when I can just install and I am done in like 20 minutes. I really wanted to like it, but it was like watching a football game on a 84 inch 4k awesome tv in the living room till halftime, then watching the rest on your phone.\nIt is expensive, and you can add the other stuff later. Watch the YouTube videos and listen to the difference. If you like it, buy it. Just don't listen to the play bar.

The sound quality is great but lacks the lows (as expected). I have it set up with the Sub though and it sounds great together and will be configuring it for a surround system with two of my Play1’s (waiting on mounts). Definitely an upgrade from my previous sound bar system. Another thing I like too is that you can still play music through it on the app and when you’re done listening to music, it will switch back over to the TV output.\n\nIt’s not a true wireless speaker since all the sonos products require the power cable and the beam also requires the HDMI to ARC/Fiber port on the TV. They do hook up to your wi-fi service and are integrated together wirelessly, so you don’t need individual cables run between the beam and other speakers you hook up to it. I haven’t noticed any lag between video on the TV or audio from the Beam or Sub. Overall, it’s decent for a stand-alone but you’ll definitely want the sub if you’re using it for a home theater system."},{"reviewerName":"Ricky Prickles","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Very disappointed","reviewDate":"The manufacturer commented on the review below","reviewText":"I picked this up as a Prime Day deal and was really looking forward to it since my Vizio soundbar just died about 2 weeks earlier.

So far I'm pretty happy with this soundbar. I did quite a bit of research, and saw many poor reviews from people on sound quality. I'm not sure how you could think that unless your room is just poor acoustics and your a sound geek. I find the speech enhancement wonderful. I've recently started to just keep subtitles on the TV because I'm tired of missing key words, but this makes the dialogue crisp. Absolutely love the feature. I also like the night mode, takes away some of the base, which is great for watching TV at night when my kids are asleep, so combine that with Speech enhancement and I can not miss a word. My TV is 9 years old and only had Digital Coaxial output, so I had to buy a Digital Coaxial to Optical converter as well as use the included optical to Arc connector. The setup recommends you turn your TV's internal speakers off through the Audio settings, which was not a function of my TV, so that made it very difficult for me to find a remote setup that wouldn't end up turning up my TV speaker volume and the Sonos Beam or vice versa. However, I did come up with a solution that is working great for me, and that is I took a pair of Ear bud headphones, and cut off the earbuds, so that it was only the connector and plugged that into my TV, that channeled the sound to the non-existent earbuds and allowed me to change the volume with my remote to control the Soundbar and not have to worry about the volume coming from the TV speakers."},{"reviewerName":"T.

My Roku TCL TV connected to it immediately (HDMI to Optical) for easy control of sound with my Roku controller.\n\nUSE was pretty good. I mentioned you can control the sound on the controller, which is true. But sometimes it would lose where it was and the sound wouldn't change even though the TV was clearly trying to change it. This required someone to go manually change the sound or keep trying until it worked. As far as Alexa, you can't block her like you can on an Echo (mute button) and there is no indication when she is listening or muted (blue lights or red). So she is always listening. Or not. Sometimes I would ask her to change the volume or another Alexa task and she wouldn't hear me and it's unclear why. I have an Echo in the kitchen - which is nearby to the living room - and sometimes I could ask her something and both Alexas would answer. Sometimes only the Echo answered. The lack of control on Alexa was a definite privacy gap for me.\n\nSOUND is great. One small speaker and I had nearly the same performance as my larger Sony speaker and box. It's pretty great.

The Sonos Beam is really a great sounding speaker system that happens to take up very little space. That said, does it replace my NHT EVO-1 7.2 system with the dual mono block bass amps? Well, of course not. However, if I lived in a smaller place, and couldn't have my big system, I would want the Beam, for sure. Also, when you consider budget vs. sound quality, and add in Sonos multi-room and multi-media flexibility, the Beam is a great value when compared to a big system on the one hand or the low end systems on the other.\n\nFirst, the installation process is very well crafted. The app (I have the iOS version) really walks you through the whole process of linking the Sonos to your home network and equipment. The smarts that are built into the unit itself are also pretty neat. I connected the Beam to my Sony XBR-X900E-Series 65\"-Class HDR UHD Smart LED TV. I connected it via the HDMI with ARC and followed all the instructions. One of the cooler setup tasks was room calibration using my iPhone as the calibration microphone. It is sort of like the process I used to setup my relatively fancy Denon receiver using a discrete mic. I would say all the setup took me maybe 30-40 minutes. The results were really great! The sound field was room width and even the bass was good most of the time. Of course, it can't fake an LFE channel, but then again it doesn't claim to. If I wanted to expand the Sonos system to include LFE, there is an add on unit called the Sonos SUB that will do the trick. In fact, you can also add another pair of Sonos speakers to make a more full home theater setup - 5.1. I don't know if it can go to 7.2 or 9.x, but if you are going that route, you probably should just get dedicated wired speakers instead. Sonos is all about pretty good sound with little effort and maximum flexibility while being in various parts of your home.\n\nAnyways, I played a few of my favorite movies on the Sonos and found it a very pleasing experience. It is amazing how it does not seem like it could be just a sound bar. Mission Impossible (various), Saving Private Ryan, 4k remaster of Bladrunner. It all sounds very good. I think if I got the woofer, it would sound awesome. BTW you can't really mix Sonos and other speakers because Sonos introduces some delay in order to cue up the various speaker elements and the picture. It is likely that if you tried to mix, you would end up with some serious phasing issues.\n\nI tried out a few other things like Amazon Alexa. It works great, and she sounds really awesome with a higher end speaker like the beam. Playback of music from my iPhone is also easy to do and sounds great. You do have to use the Sonos app, though, instead of just playing back from Music or other apps, which I think is a limitation.\n\nSO, I am completely sold. Sonos is the way to go for small sound systems."},{"reviewerName":"Kll799","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Excellent audio addition for a bedroom TV","reviewDate":"January 19, 2019","reviewText":"The Sonos beam is an excellent addition to a TV that is only using the TV speakers.

The Sonos beam doesn’t have a subwoofer, and thus not as dramatic with low range audio. However, being in a more quite bedroom, this is not something we would even want to add. Sonos does have a larger, well-reviewed system if your looking for a soundbar for a larger room for more of a home theatre setup. The Sonos beam is small and thus not very noticeable, which again is perfect for a room where you don’t need or want a lot of audio equipment. One aspect that works well with this soundbar is that you can hear spoken voices very clearly and don’t have to turn the volume up insuring dialogue and than back down for an action scene.

The sound was great and has quite a good punch, and it worked perfectly with the 2 Play:1's that was originally provided in the airbnb... we had a surround sound setup within 10 min and a youtube song list that everyone can participate editing on their own devices. A few glitches here and there, but overall, it was a great addition to our party and activities."},{"reviewerName":"Mmm","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Very compact with very good sound","reviewDate":"July 19, 2018","reviewText":"Packaging: what you’d expect from a higher end product nowadays. Little color indicators on pull tabs, individual boxes within the main box has photo diagrams of what they are. It includes everything you need to get up and running as well as an optional optical adapter.\n\nSetup: pulled out the cords and started going at it. Mistake. Read the directions, in the app!! The app will walk you through everything including mandatory updates. It determined my cheapo 55” Tcl LED tv and told me accurately which menu I needed to go into to activate the speaker once connected. Once I did that, it came alive and my son immediately said, it sounds like the real thing. He was playing an Xbox game between the times I took away the screen.\n\nSound: plenty of bass. You need to be a real bass head to want more. Perfectly sufficient for such a compact speaker. Easily disappears behind the tv taking up little space. I’m no audiophile, but it’s appreciable. I can tell the difference between garbage and this produces nice sound.\n\nIt easily connected to my Google Play account. I haven’t tried playing music yet. That’s the best bet I think to hear how the highs sound.\n\nOverall: impressed.

Sure it may not play every surround sound format available or give you the features of a full home theater system. Let's keep things in perspective. It's a sound bar designed to provide you better sound to your tv. I would never replace my $15000 surround system with a sound bar and expect the same result. Sonos provides a great sound with simplicity and reliability being the number one focus. Seen 1 star guy mention audio delay issues but didn't see that review mention that there are audio delay settings within the app! Complaint about not accepting Dolby Atmos signal. If your worried about all those things then spend the money for a real surround sound system. If not then spend the $399 and you will love it!

I just want decent audio for shows, games, etc. I’m already a big fan of Sonos, and decided to get a Beam shortly after it releases. I’d been using a Logitech 2.1 system that sounded pretty decent. My first impression of the Beam is it had very little bass. This was mostly relative to comparing it with my previous speakers that had a sub, but I also realized my first test was with music. The Beam is not great for music, which I’ve come to terms with since I use it on my TV and rarely play music on it. For TV audio, I LOVE the beam. Even without a sub, it has fantastic bass, to the point it’s hard to believe this little bar is producing so much bass. Speech clarity is excellent, which is a big deal since the Beam is my only audio source for my TV. If you’re like me, the Beam will probably be great for you.

It has that “extra weight” that most of the time comes from the quality of the materials used to built it. I watched Star Wars yesterday and the sound was huge, clean and precise.

I think those people that think its too quiet have not balanced it nor turned up the equalizer at all, or maybe it doesn't work great with their Tvs. It gets quite loud. Quite full sounding.\n\nI replaced an old \"dumb\" theatre system for this. It sounds quite a bit better in a much more compact space. My living room is 13x30. Much bigger and maybe it would start to sound weak? I used to have to have the subtitles on during movies. The bad balance of modern movies. Noise overruns voice. This speaker seems to accentuate dialog. I can watch tv at 1/2 the volume and comfortably hear dialog.\nTo answer some questions that I had when I researched it. It acts exactly like the play one or any other Sonos. Just another Sonos speaker with an Alexa and a line in. You can set it up with other speakers to make a theatre system or use it as a solo speaker. Connect it to other rooms. Whatever you want. It does NOT need to act as a home theatre system. But you can set it up to do that.\n\nSad that it only has the ARC input. All speakers should have blue tooth and 1/8\" jacks nowadays. Want you to buy the $350 connect.\n\nOnly have the one other Sonos speaker right now. Plan on getting more. But I can be cooking in the kitchen and use the sonos One to listen to the TV without using the Sonos Beam. Or have both going. Whatever.\n\nApp is easy enough to use. Not great. Not bad. With Alexa its not necessary to have the app around all the time. \"Alexa play Spotify\" \"Alexa, Turn on the tv (with newer tvs)\" \"Alexa set the volume to 3\" At least for me; once its set up with the TV you don't need to change inputs. The TV overrides when you turn it on.\n\nThe Alexa app is a bit hobbled on the Beam bar. Can't make calls. Can't do any display stuff, obviously. Add skills to alexa. \"i'm sorry I can't do that on this device\" She hears really well though. I haven't played with alexa much before.

After all, Apple's Airplay 2 is now integrated - meaning the speaker shows up as a destination for tunes played on your Macbook, iPad or iPhone - and I figured an additional stereo speaker couldn't hurt.\n\nWell, I was right and wrong. Setup was easy enough; the Sonos app remembered all the one-time settings to get onto my Wifi and was able to instruct the Beam to do that without any additional effort on my part. My Sonos:One replaced a stereo Airplay speaker that died. I use it in my garage to provide music for my workouts, and the sound quality's great, but I figured I could make a stereo sound field out there with the Beam.\n\nWell, that's a nope. Oh, it works well enough - you can group the speakers together - but only if the limited Sonos app is a source. I use the Spotify freestanding app with Airfoil, or iTunes, for 99% of my listening - the Sonos app can't see local files via its Spotify interface. So I wanted the two devices, the One and the Beam, to be a single Airplay destination speaker. But they're not; they are two separate devices. \"Hey, couldn't you get around that by adding the One to the Beam as a surround speaker?\" Well, yes, in theory, if the Beam let you use a single surround speaker. But it won't; in order to set up surround sound, you need two other Sonos speakers, it won't accept just one unless it's a sub. I want you to know that I'm about as annoyed at having to know all this techy stuff as you probably are reading about it; I just want to play all my music in my garage. Sonos' one-touch setup is about as easy as it gets, but the devil is in the details for those of us who want a more customizable setup.\n\nSo what about the sound quality? Well, everyone knows that soundbars aren't as good as freestanding speakers, but based on my good experience with the One - really crisp low mids, that \"ported\" sound (pioneered by Bose), good deep bass, and clear treble - I was expecting something similar from the Beam. I was disappointed; there's no low mids at all, bass is nonexistent, and the upper treble register has very poor fidelity, it sounds scratchy or almost staticky if the drummer is doing hi-hat work. Basically this speaker is tuned like a center channel speaker would be - a very narrow band of good fidelity around 1 kHz, designed for reproducing dialogue in movies and TV shows.\n\nSo I plugged it into my TV and tested it in place of my MartinLogan Encore TF center channel speaker, the one with the thin-film tweeters. Yeah, nope. Setup is easy enough - the Beam wants to be your single audio solution for TV and movie watching - and it's really nicely equipped to set that up easily and quickly over either HDMI or TOSLink fiber optic - but if your ears are used to anything other than the absolute bottom of the barrel, you will notice immediately that the sound quality is a substantial downgrade. And given the pricepoint, that takes the Beam down to 3 stars for me. You can get on Ebay, get a low-end Yamaha receiver and my MartinLogan center channel speaker for less than what the Beam is selling for, if you know how to hook up wires, and if you do, I think I'd recommend that in place of the Beam. I understand some of what you're paying for is the Sonos software secret sauce, but the Sonos secret sauce does not appear to me to be in my interest, or any listener's interest - it appears to me that Sonos is monitoring my music tastes and net traffic, phoning home regularly, and putting an always-listening Alexa mic in a room, and that that is a business model for Sonos where I am the product and can be sold to their vendor partners. In which case, the speaker should be free.\n\nThe Beam, by the way, is an annoying 28 inches in width. It didn't fit a couple places I wanted to put it, but it's not really wide enough for great stereo separation either. Thought I'd mention it.\n\nMy guess is there'll be a Beam 2, with bigger and better quality cones, in a year or two. If you're dead set on a Sonos soundbar, I think I'd advise waiting for it."},{"reviewerName":"cokid","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Doesn't work with Samsung TV and Chromecast - FYI","reviewDate":"November 2, 2019","reviewText":"Sound is great, but Hope this saves some people some time -- i have a Samsung TV 55” Series 8, and just bought a Sonos Beam.

I have many Sonos speakers including two Playbars, a Sub, and several Sonos Play:1's. I was very excited when I heard about the Beam. I picked one up yesterday and spent the evening setting it up. My initial reaction is positive but slighted muted due to some issues that I think will get worked out over time. I set this up in my Bedroom. Installation and setup was straight forward and the Sonos app does a good job of walking you through it all. My initial reaction was very positive. The sound is great - a huge improvement over my Samsung TV's internal speakers. All that worked without a hitch. Then I started exploring some of the Alexa features and this is where there were a few bumps in the road. When I saw that my DirecTV HR44 was able to be controlled by Alexa I was thinking how great that would be. I had a really hard time making it work. I was convinced I was doing something wrong...but I got it to Pause my DirecTV once, so I knew I was onto something. After playing with it for another 30 minutes and linking and unlinking my devices a few times I got it working. Here are the two issues I had. It seems like the first time I issue a command for the DirecTV box I have to say \"on DirecTV\"....but after that it's not necessary. Another issue was while watching TV and switching the Beam to play music I could not get it to resume the TV audio without going back to the app. I looked up workarounds and ONCE when I said \"Alexa, switch to TV\" it worked...but never again. Finally this morning when I asked Alexa to turn on the TV nothing happened. I was able to do it multiple times last night.\nI feel pretty confident that most of these issues will get resolved with software updates and refinements over the next few days and weeks.

Sometimes it is hilarious; however, it is not so funny when you are on the telephone and Alexa begins to talk.\n\nOverall, my wife and I love the sound of the music from this sound bar and we are not really upset by the fact that we have been unable to connect it with the ARC on our smart Sony TV.\n\nThe sound is breathtaking on the variety of music we have listened to on both our cell phones and Alexa’s connection to the music on Amazon.com.\n\nI am sure that we could resolve our television sound if that were a priority for us; however, it is not and the music makes this a great choice in our small but comfortable 1152 square foot home.\n\nEnjoy!"},{"reviewerName":"Clayton","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Horrendously bad out of the box experience","reviewDate":"The manufacturer commented on the review below","reviewText":"Spent 1 hour trying to connect my Sonos beam to a 2.4 ghz router (specifically 2.4ghz because they can't handle 5 ghz for setup).

I’m loving the Beam so far. We added a pair of Sonos One speakers for the rear audio channel and the room is now full of sound. The Beam is loud too. Watching movies at around 50% of the volume and it’s really loud. Not even sure I need to add the subwoofer in the future, the rear speakers do a nice job of adding atmospheric bass.\n\nRegarding sound quality, it’s a different league than my previous Samsung speaker...which had a bunch of different modes to try to simulate a full sound. With the Sonos Beam, there are compact speakers all around...front, back, sides. Sound gets projected in every direction. And the audio is crystal clear.\n\nOne last thing to add, the Beam has built in support for Alexa and Airplay...super convenient. The PlayBar by itself has a much beefier sound than the Beam, but adding a couple play 1:s and a sub negates that. I felt like I could save a little money and build a system, rather than put it all in one speaker."},{"reviewerName":"Jorze","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Clear sound","reviewDate":"July 28, 2019","reviewText":"Great sound quality for the size.

The set up was very easy and in 10 minutes it was working. It is a vast improvement in the sound from my Samsung LCD TV; however, the clarity of the sound - I wanted a sound bar because dialog especially if you are watching a British TV program is from time to time unintelligible and I resort to using closed caption to understand the speech. The Sonos has a setting to improve spoken sound which I have found to be a disappointment; there is not much of an improvement here. While the dynamic range is a huge improvement over a flat panel TV, the clarity is just so-so. If you are looking for a better sound experience, this is fine but if you want clarity of dialog, I would look elsewhere.

Even so, I guess there are more expensive soundbars out there. I'm not sure what you would get that is any better than this one, though. The sound is excellent. I'm impressed. Listening to music was a pleasure, with full and detailed sound.\n\nThis is marketed as a soundbar for televisions, but I use it for a computer. That means using an optical coupler rather HDMI ARC, so I can't use Amazon Alexa with this. For me that doesn't matter. But I can't comment on how well that works, since I haven't tried it.\n\nThis soundbar is compact and fits under my computer monitor. It's great for gaming, listening to music, and watching videos. On occasion I'll take it into the living room and use it with our television. (That too is an optical coupler, as our television is rather old.) It's portable enough to move easily, but not so much so that I want to move it often.\n\nAs mentioned, I don't usually spend much for speakers, so I can't comment on Sonos quality as opposed to other high-end speakers, or even this soundbar compared to Sonos's more expensive sets.

HDMI ARC works seamlessly, without setup for the most part. Size is good in contrast to most of the huge soundbars. Three big issues: 1) With current software using the auto-tuned via the phone and in all modes, deep male voices are muddy for TV dialog (basically any sports announcer will sounds like they are blending all their words). I manually adjusted Bass down and Treb up a bit for clear dialog at normal watching volumes. Seems like it's tuned for music over dialog. 2) I bought with sub and I wouldn't buy it without the sub. At this point, you're in a different price class. The Base unit has good bass and similar width. 3) Volume steps could be more plentiful. There are 4 steps between silent and \"honey, turn it down\" currently.\nTwo of these are software fixes, the lack of bass in the bar itself means you're only getting about a 10% improvement over TV audio without the sub.

What I mean is, I think its as good as it can be given its size. The sound quality is far superior to television speakers, even nice ones.\n\nHowever, it was the devil to set up. The Sonos iOS app, to put it politely, is infuriating. I was unable to register, because, I was informed I had an account-- but the password recovery e-mail never came. Once I registered for an account with an alternate e-mail, I was unable to check for firmware updates for the Beam. As it turns out, this is important. Without an initial firmware update, the beam won't do anything. Nothing. So I spent an hour checking HDMI cables, etc. To no avail.\n\nI decided to dump the configuration and re-setup the device. When eventually the firmware updates started working, the beam sprung to life, and sounded pretty bad. Another hour of monkeying with the Sonos App and I found the \"Trueplay\" tunning, which seems to characterize the acoustics of the room and the EQ accordingly. After running this, the Beam sounded remarkably better, and much more like what I've come to expect from Sonos.\n\nSo the long and short of it is this: Good hardware, ill-conceived, joyless software. I don't see how the average consumer could set this up."},{"reviewerName":"Jay","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"No Bluetooth","reviewDate":"September 22, 2018","reviewText":"No Bluetooth is a dealbreaker.

A stereo paired HomePod connected to apple tv sound much better for just about everything. Apple TV is my only source so that works.\nSonos needs to clean up their home theater offerings. The Player is flat out obsolete since it is optical only and will never do Alexa, Airplay 2, or Google assistant. the Playbasae is better but is also only optical and you have to want to put it under your TV which I don't.
