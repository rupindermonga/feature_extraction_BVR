For music, yes, this is an excellent device. The sound is loud, clear and surprisingly well-rounded. Alexa recognizes voice commands very well in this respect. Movies, on the other hand, are a struggle. First, Alexa does not recognize most movie names by voice command, even ones I know are on Prime Video. Next, if you have Alexa take you directly to Prime Video, it offers only a \"lite\" version of the service. You cannot search movies well and the few categories they have stop at 60 results. Being that I can easily stream 4-6 movies a day while working, I've already exhausted most of the good choices. Then, for whatever reason, the audio volume on videos is 50-70% lower than music. So in order to watch a video at arm's length away, I have to turn the volume to 1/2 at minimum, but usually 3/4. I don't understand the massive disparity between music and movie volume. Worse yet, if Alexa responds to a command while I'm watching a movie at that volume, her voice is two or three times louder than the movie, which is to say, obnoxiously loud. Now, maybe I bought this for the wrong purpose. I am never going to video call or have it control my lights, nor am I going to ask it to set an alarm or give me a recipe. However, with the marketing claiming there are tens of thousands of commands, I was under the impression that doing something as simple as using Amazon's own video streaming service would be incredibly smooth. Unfortunately it is not. And like others have said, this is a touch screen after all, but there are very few things you can actually use it for. I think I am used to the app screen on my phone I guess. I keep expecting to be able to go to a home screen and pick what I want to do. With no clear index of abilities, I really have no idea what I can do until I try things. Then, after Alexa tells me she doesn't understand five or ten times, I just give up. Last, I've gotten some errors while streaming video that claim the device's storage is full and it can no longer stream. Well, there is no apparent way to clear the storage; streaming data should be temporarily stored and automatically replaced with new data anyway. Because of this, I've had to restart the unit to clear the memory, which can only be done by unplugging it. Yes, really, even with a touch screen and pull-down menu at the top, there's no restart button, you actually have to unplug it. Decisions like these make me question who they had working on R&D. Some of these things just don't make sense. I do think this has the potential to be a 5-star device with the hardware as-is -- the screen is very nice and the speakers sound excellent except for the volume issue. I know not to expect the functionality of a pad or phone with a mobile OS, but I also feel very limited by the intuitiveness and functionality of the system as it is today. Unfortunately I doubt the fixes will come before my refund eligibility expires..."},{"reviewerName":"Elem Sea","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Home Screen ANNOYING x 1000","reviewDate":"October 31, 2018","reviewText":"Can't disable the stupid home.

This is a great kitchen companion. The screen is large enough to view from across the room. Before adding an ingredient to a dish, you can confirm the measurement without walking away from the stove, bowl, mixer e.t.c. It has great speakers so you can fill the room with sound as you prepare your gourmet dish. I am hesitant about putting it in the bedroom, video calling :). When I purchased my show, Amazon offered a free smart light bulb. I wish they would bring back that offer. Not that I would buy another show, but it might help others purchase one, if they were considering having a smart home.\n\nThe new Echo Show is a must have!!!!!!\n\nI purchased my Akexa Show from an Amazon kiosk in a mall.

When using normal volume speech, but with the Echo volume set fairly low, Alexa now answers at a suitably low volume. And today, I was able to activate the new Whispermode, which works great! You whisper to Alexa, she whispers back to you.\n\nI'm raising my rating to 4.5 stars. If Amazon would ever remove the annoying “Try this” messages ruining my home screen photo (and music screens as well), I would probably rate this as 5 stars. (This is unfortunately unlikely to happen, as Echo Show users have been complaining about this for a year and a half, but it hasn't changed.)\n\nI upgraded from the first generation Echo Show. I’ll get my one real complaint out of the way first. On the second generation Show, you can lower the volume for music and videos, but not for the Alexa voice. Even with the volume set very low, so I can listen to music without disturbing anyone, if I need to interact with Alexa, her response will be very loud. This didn't happen with the first generation Echo. On that one, if I turned down the volume, everything was turned down, including Alexa. I did send feedback to Amazon about this, and I see someone else here commented on the problem. I'm eagerly awaiting the new whispermode, which isn't on my device yet, but really, I just want the voice volume to work the same way it did on the first generation.\n\nI do really like the bigger screen size, which is a pleasure to watch. I'm also enjoying using the Silk browser to access YouTube. (You get to it by saying “Alexa, open Silk.” ) You can't use voice to search for YouTube videos, but if you're willing to sign into a YouTube account, you can access your saved video lists and get to the videos quickly that way. I also used the browser to access my local PBS TV station and watched some on demand video on that."},{"reviewerName":"RSB","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"An Inccemental Improvement Over The First Generation - 7 Things You Should Know - Updated Review","reviewDate":"October 17, 2018","reviewText":"Edit - 11/26/2018\n\nUpdated review after approximately six weeks of ownership with daily usage.\n\nI had the first generation of this product and received this the day it was released. I've used four of these Echo Shows daily. I don't want to repeat the other great reviews on here so will try to add extra seven extra pieces information that may be helpful to you.\n\n1) I wish Amazon and Google would band together and get over their silent feud. I'm a huge fan of both companies (sorry Apple), but their products don't work well together. After Amazon removed YouTube from the first generation product, I was more than upset. Well, now you can get YouTube here via a workaround method. You can use either Amazon's Silk Browser of the Firefox Browser on this device. Neither works exceptionally well and I've found that Firefox works a little better, faster and with fewer hiccups. So, you can get YouTube - just not on the YouTube native application. It's not as good and linking your Google user account to the device and is much more difficult to do.\n\n2) It's difficult to get a Google-branded doorbell, the Nest thermostat or the Google camera to work with this device. There are workarounds (many listed with a simple web search) that take a lot of time and technical knowledge to set-up, but everything seems like a workaround and isn't easy. Amazon wants you to purchase their Ring doorbell, another thermostat brand (EcoBee), and Amazon-branded cameras. This is very frustrating, to say the least. I beta test Google Products and it's the same thing there. Their new Google Home Hub doesn't support Amazon products well, but that's a different review for a different platform Again, these two behemoth awesome companies need to come to terms and support each other's ecosystems. I know it's a competitive \"thing\" that is supposed to benefit the shareholder via an increased profit margin. However, as the consumer, this is a sore huge spot for me and I assume others?\n\n3) I've used the drop-in feature from the Amazon Application on my phone to this device. It's slow; painfully slow to connect and subsequently come into focus. Moreover, the camera on this device shoots up the ceiling so you can't really see the entire room you've \"dropped-into\" well. In order to see someone, they have to be directly in front of the device. Perhaps these are meant to be security/privacy features or are these just half-baked implementations?\n\n4) I like that you can now issue a follow-up command to Alexa. That is, you can program the device to listen to your request without saying the wake word \"Alexa\" again.\n\n5) The user interface seems rudimentary. - almost like a pre-schooler designed it. Sure the screen is larger, but simply displaying the weather, a clock or sports scores on a cartoonish-like background isn't enough. I'd really like to see my Google doorbell and cameras as a default dashboard here without purchasing the Google Home Hub. My hopes are this changes with future software updates. Amazon: you employ some of the smartest talent in the world so please upgrade this simplistic screen interface. It looks silly and very much like a Palm Pilot interface on the early 2000s.\n\n6) Why oh why does Amazon Prime only display the last 60 shows in your library here? You need to use the phone/tablet/computer application to see your entire library. Amazon Prime shows are another fantastic thing about an Amazon membership, so why limit the ability to see a users' inventory? Also, the volume on Prime video is much softer than when playing Amazon Prime music.\n\n7) If you care about someone seeing your personal pictures, you can restrict access to your Amazon picture library, That is, you can disable the picture feature on the settings menu via a toggle switch, the picture library comes \"ON\" by default. So....if you have any compromising/private pictures uploaded from your phone automatically to the Amazon Cloud, you may not want them to display on your Echo device.\n\nAll-in-all, this is an incremental improvement over the original product with the best feature being the larger screen size. The speaker sound is OK, but not fantastic as a few other reviews note and the sound is lower when using Amazon Prime video. I'd like to see a better and more modern user interface and better ability to integrate with Google products."},{"reviewerName":"Marc S.","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Can't see the time from a few feet away....","reviewDate":"October 20, 2018","reviewText":"Someone at Amazon thought it would be a good idea to make the clock tiny and non-changeable.

Looked promising but the screen was a bit small for the price tag. Glad I waited for Gen 2! The screen on this thing is beautiful. Full HD and vibrant colors. I'm amazed that I can watch my Prime shows and it looks great. I also love the lyrics on the screen for Amazon Music. Sometimes I just want a solo karaoke session in my kitchen.\nThe sound of the Echo Show was what impressed me the most. I'm upgrading from a 1st Gen Echo Dot and the moment I heard the sound of the Show, I was blown away! There is so much bass and the volume can get insanely loud for such a little device. The kitchen might be my second most favorite spot in the house. Touchscreen is also very responsive and works great. The only thing I wish it had was an app hub so I can choose exactly what I want. Sometimes Alexa doesn't understand what I want to watch. Best Amazon machine ever!!

The sound quality on this Echo Show is definitely better than the first generation. The screen is bolder as well. I own a first generation Echo Show as well... I do not love the new software update that hit all Echo Shows. For example, if I set my background to show my family photos from Amazon Photos, I do not want to see stock photos of news stories as well! I know I can turn off updates in my settings... BUT I like the words from the updates, I just want them over my photos like the old Echo software! As it stands now, a family picture will come up, then a news story photo. This is quite annoying!\n\nI do not know how long Amazon will rule this market. The new Google Hub looks like a great device. However, the inferior sound and lack of a camera still puts it behind the Echo Show. But in a couple years if a Google Hub Max comes out... I may switch to that! The Google brain just is outpacing what Amazon’s articfical intelligence can do. (I have both Echos, Echo Shows, and Google Home’s in my house!) Facebook also just released an interesting device similar to the Echo Show that lets you video message FaceTime Messenger contacts. But as of 2018-2019, in my opinion, this is the best device of its kind on the market!

I noticed within 5 minutes, the Echo would close the browser entirely and go back to the home screen. ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!! I never owned an electronic device that pissed me off so much. I'm ready to make my own Youtube video (that you would have to watch on any other device except the Echo Show) of me shooting this piece of garbage and FINALLY getting some enjoyment out of it.\n\nUpdate (12/17/18): So I've had my Show for 2 months and I have to say that nothing really changed. It still remains an expensive disappointment. There has been an issue since the beginning where after watching so many videos on Prime Video, the show will no longer play videos until the device is restarted. My volume down and mute buttons are going to wear out from having restarted it so much. I have to do this about every 2 days. I know it needs to be restarted because when trying to play a video of any kind from any source, the Show will perform really slow and seem to load for a minute or two when selecting a video, then just back out and not play anything. This is kind of ridiculous. At the time of writing this, there is still no Netflix either. I see the Shows are sold out until after Christmas. I hope people aren't buying these as gifts or they're going to have some pretty disappointed spouse's/relatives.\n\nI previously wrote a review with more stars, but the more I use the Echo Show, The more i'm starting to dislike it. Watching the movies that you own on Prime Video is a nightmare. Once you get a movie or show playing, it works fine. But the voice commands to get certain movies to play is a nightmare. Name a certain movie and she will say it back wrong, or say she couldn't find it. Try saying play whatever from my library, and she thinks it's a skill. It's super frustrating. Have Alexa turn lights off during a movie and the movie pauses for about a minute so it can show you a toggle button for you lights. Pause a movie? it'll stay paused for about a minute, then go to the home screen, to which there is no \"resume\" or \"continue movie\" command. You have to tell her to play whatever show or movie again. I bought this to replace an old Samsung tablet that I had on my desk to watch Youtube or Netflix while doing other things. I miss those days to be completely honest.

But, after spending a few hours with it, I’m not that impressed. I’ll start off by saying the sound quality and output is amazing, other than that, I’m struggling to find a good use for it. I’ll give a full rundown below:\n\nBackstory:\n\nThis is my first “screened” echo product. Originally, I was thinking this would have similar features to an android tablet. I wanted to use it in the kitchen and run some of my cooking/recipe “apps” on it. I somehow missed the memo that the Show is essentially an echo dot with a screen, and you can only choose from the limited “Amazon Skills” selection from the Alexa app using voice control. *In full disclosure and “TMI”, I’m on a strict low-carb/ sugar-free diet - the native recipe skill is almost useless for me...*\n\nI know, I know, you can watch prime and other videos on it, but I have no idea why you would want to watch something on a 10” tabletop screen when your TV is 10x bigger, or on a tablet that's 50x thinner...\n\nThere is almost zero personalization available and everything seems to be locked down. Heck, I can’t even select items or information (like 5-day weather, news, calendar) to display on the home screen. Unless I’m missing something here, looks like the whole operating system literally just runs off the voice-controlled “skills”.\n\nOut of curiosity, I went ahead and ordered the Fire HD 10” tablet with “Show Dock”, and I'm glad I did... With the Fire Tablet, I'm able to run the apps I like and it's completely mobile. I don't have the sound quality that the Show had, but this can easily be fixed with a nice Bluetooth speaker."},{"reviewerName":"C.

Our household uses the devices on a daily basis. I was pretty excited about the possibility of the Echo show. We could use it in the kitchen for the family calendar! Or for recipes! Or maybe to watch a show! Oh the possibilities!\n\nWe bought their 2 for $120 off deal black Friday 2018. I was intending on giving one of the units to the in-laws for Christmas and putting the other in our kitchen. The in-laws were wanting something that showed a nice big clock with the date and day of the week (among other things). I figured that the show would definitely be able to do that! Turns out I was sorely mistaken. The clock is a small little thing in the top corner that is not customizable at all. No date, no day of the week.\n\nBut hey, at least it has a calendar right?.. that is essentially useless. It only shows one or two days, or not even a day if you have multiple things on the calendar. It doesn't even highlight what the current day it is! There is no monthly or weekly view, just a extremely zoomed in view of 1 or two appointments. There is no option to customize anything. You get what you get. Why would you have a calendar without a week/month view?\n\nWe also were thinking it would be great for recipes. Turns out that because I'm in Canada, close to none of the 'standard' skills even work. Amazon has geolocked the recipes skill!?!? Ok, so no problem we can't use the recipes skill that is advertised clearly on the side of the box. I'll get over that and use the browser to show a recipe. So, I opened up the browser to a recipe site and started cooking dinner. After a couple minutes, the device times out and returns to the home screen! \"Alexa, reopen my browser\" should get me back to the page I was on right? No! It takes me back to the home page and I have to navigate to the recipe again. Rinse and repeat every two minutes until I give up and open up a physical cookbook.\n\nEVERYTHING that I wanted to do with this device doesn't work. No clock, no calendar, no recipies, no netflix, no <insert whatever you think it will do here>. I'm sure that all these things will all get addressed in time,but right now it really falls short.\n\nI gave this 3 stars because the actual physical product is excellent. Quality is great, speakers sound really good, screen is bright. I have no complaints about anything physical on the device. It really is a very nice physical product, but the firmware is close to completely useless for anything that I want to do with it. I will most likely return the units I bought.

Easy to set up. I had the Show up and functional in under 15 minutes. It was already registered to me, all I had to do was rename it (based on the room I placed it in). Downloading the Alexa iPhone app made setup even easier. Within about 30 minutes I had most of the home smart devices connected, included Nest devices and the SmartThings hub.\n\n2. Good sound. I don't think it will compete with a Sonos or the new Apple Homepod, but the sound is good, and for most applications, more than good enough.\n\n3. Very nice to have the calendar and other life-organizing items pulled in from Google and other sources to show on the screen.\n\n4. Does a nice job showing recipes.\n\n5. It will read your kindle books to you.\n\nThe bad stuff:\n\n1. Alexa doesn't handle names very well. And, if you have names in SmartThings that weren't fully thought out, you may run into a few problems. To clean up the labels for a voice-activated environment, I had to carefully rename a number of items and groups, ensuring that no words overlapped. That can be a challenge with multiple Hue lamps and other smart devices in the same room. Naming the lamps kitchen 1, kitchen 2, and kitchen 3 works great, until you also want a group called Kitchen Lights.... Same for the porch lights, and so on. In the end, I've renamed almost every device with some name that is not directly overlapping with the group I want it in (usually a group will be a room).\n\n2. The device sits with the screen, and the camera, at an angle. This is OK if you are reading a list, but not so great if you want to use DropIn either as an intercom, or to check on your home while you are away. As I mentioned in my Echo Spot review, mostly you get a great view of the ceiling. For the hefty price take (about $220) the device should allow adjustment of the camera angle.\n\n3. The unit is made to sit on a surface, a shelf or a counter. It would be great to be able to wall mount it, but that won't happen without some special hardware.\n\nOne other item to discuss: all Alexa devices require a login. You can login with the same account on all of them, which solves some problems, but causes others. I have a wife and two kids. Alexa assumes everyone is me, because I logged in with my Amazon account on all the devices. So? It means the reminders are mine, the alarms are mine, the calendars are mine... all my stuff on every device.\n\nAmazon, if you really want to make Alexa useful, you need to make Alexa family-aware. If my son updates the calendar on the Spot in his room, it should stay with him, and he doesn't need to know about my appointments.

Solberg","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Nice product, but the interface isn't there quite yet.","reviewDate":"October 17, 2018","reviewText":"This is nicely designed hardware. Pulling it out of the box, you get a sense that you're buying something of good quality. It has good, loud speakers, and a reasonably nice screen. I was pretty excited.\n\nUnfortunately, the user interface let me down. I can feel the huge potential for this product, but every time I tried to do something, I was stymied in some way. It's not like it's a bad interface, it's more like it's not finished. For example, the home screen seems like it would be a great way to check on my day. I'd like to see a forecast for the today and maybe the next couple of days on the main screen. The other half of the screen could show maybe sports scores or news headlines, or maybe the status of all the connected lights in the house, or maybe a touch screen of quick actions to jump to recently used stuff.\n\nNone of that is available. You can get a rotating view of news headlines, but you can't pick your source. You can see sports information, but for some reason it only shows my local football team, and there's no way to choose. This would be a perfect heads up display, but the rotation of elements means that you'll have to stare at the screen for a long time before what you need pops up. Again, lots of potential, but not there yet.\n\nAnother thing to do with this is watch videos in the kitchen when you're cooking. This works okay, but everything about choosing and finding episodes in clunky and unfinished. For example, I wanted to watch the next show in the series I was watching, but for some reason, it went to the first episode. I could not see any way to go to the episodes list so I could choose the next episode, and I didn't know the correct number, so I couldn't try asking Alexa.\n\nI thought about keeping it because if Amazon keeps iterating on the UI, someday it could be quite useful. However, at this point, it's well-designed hardware with software that frustratingly just wouldn't do what I wanted. I also considered keeping it because it works with the Fire TV Recast, but in the end, the hard to use interface was just a little too much to overcome, at least for now."},{"reviewerName":"Bron","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Definite improvement, some software issues on release","reviewDate":"October 16, 2018","reviewText":"First, this is an order of magnitude improvement in terms of hardware. Much larger screen, which looks great. Very bright, good color, all as expected. It looks nicer as well. This device is larger and heavier. The sound is much improved in terms of the speakers, drivers, etc. and it has bass response the 1st gen Echo could not dream of. All in all, much as presented here on Amazon.\n\nAs expected, there are some software issues and omissions. It's a new release, after all. So I'm sure Amazon will be fixing these soon. Many have noticed the LOUD Alexa voice response. It is truly annoying. Hopefully, they will fix this soon. Ideally they would let you set Alexa's voice response level independently from media. As it is, media volume is much lower.\n\nAlso, they appear to have used spatial processing to give you a stereo effect and it works great. But it's not always desirable. There should be an option to disable it. For example, it works great for some music, but not well at all for other music. Also, the bass response is overdone - for some things - even when I lower the bass in the equalizer to minimum levels. The equalizer adjustments need more range or tweaking, in my opinion. At first I thought, wow, I won't need my external speakers now, This thing sounds great. But as I went on, I soon learned that wasn't the case and reverted back to using my Bluetooth speaker. The spatial effect interference with mid-range (vocals) is the primary reason as it alters the balance of sounds, but the over-done boomy bass is also an issue. It's less of an issue at lower volumes.\n\nSome music sounds great. And movies I watched from Prime Video all sounded very good. With movies the bass and spatial sound works very well and everything sounded fantastic. It made for a very enjoyable movie experience.\n\nI was a beta user for the original Echo and we went through some of this with that device as well and Amazon did a great job of addressing the issues, so I am sure they will do the same this time around. The hardware is a huge step up in performance, so the results should be excellent.\n\nSo vastly improved screen and sound drivers, they just need to get the software tweaked for music. Also, as some have noted, not all of the functionality is working properly at this point. Most all of the basic stuff does. Some things still have glitches. But give them time.\n\nI will try to come back and update as things unfold. Giving 4 stars for now as I like it even with the glitches.\n\nUpdate:After lowering the bass (a lot) and moving the Echo to another location, sound has improved. Still would like finer controls, but it definitely has great sound potential. Some songs sound incredibly good. The spatial effect can be very enjoyable with the right source material. Also, as mentioned, it works extremely well with most movies."},{"reviewerName":"Connie Barrett","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Faulty Video on Echo 2nd Gen black and white with lines during calls.","reviewDate":"November 10, 2018","reviewText":"I've tried to update my review, they seem to not let it through.

For the first 3 months of using the Show, I did not use anything Zigbee-related, so it didn’t seem to be a benefit. However, I’ve discovered some fantastic Sengled light bulbs which are Zigbee-certified and will connect directly with the Show. What this means is I don’t need a separate hub, I don’t have to use up another electrical outlet, I don’t have to download another app, and I don’t have to download another Skill. Everything is easily set up through the Alexa app — hallelujah! So, though the Show still remains limited in many ways, being able to set up and control my new smart light bulbs is a new big plus to me. I now have smart light bulbs and Amazon Smart Plugs all using only the Alexa app.\n\nUpdated 2/3/19: I find this device to be disappointing for the price. I’ve had the Show for two months now. It has a few positives (nice display, decent sound, Zigbee controller) and others have commented on them. I don’t use Zigbee devices, so that’s not a benefit to me. However, what I noticed most are the negatives:\n\n1. It can’t do 2 things at one time. For instance, it’s not possible to watch the livestream of your baby sleeping and also play music or an audiobook. It can do one or the other. A Fire tablet can do both, though without the audio power of the Show.\n2. It’s not possible to watch the map tracking of your delivery. Perhaps it would require computer components to do that, but I find it annoying that it’s not possible on the Show. It’s available on my Fire tablets or Shop Amazon app, and it would be nice to watch on the Show.\n3. It has no light ring for notifications. I’m surprised at how irritating I find this. I can walk through a room that has an Echo or Dot in it and immediately see that there is something I should attend to. Not so with the Show. Only if I happen to be in the room at the time a message arrives will I be aware there is a message.\n4. It doesn’t show the list of your skills. Alexa will read them off instead. This is way too slow.\n5. It nicely plays Prime videos. However, it’s like watching a 10 inch TV when I’ve got a huge big screen and Fire TV on the opposite wall.\n6. It emits a lot of light, just like a TV, even at the lowest light level. If I have the ambient clock on, there is way too much light emitted for a bedroom (unless you want a ten-inch bright nightlight). I can turn off the clock which will allow the display to eventually go dark, but then I have no clock, although I can always ask Alexa the time.\n7. It’s heavy and tethered to the electrical cord. I like to move around my kitchen and sometimes move my recipes with me. I can’t do that with the Show. Plus, I can’t enlarge the font.\n8. I noticed that some of my Skills sometimes flash a message on the screen and by the time I get up close to read what it says, the message is gone. Gone, as in no way to replay it (that I can find).\n\nI love my Fire tablets, Echos, Dots, and Fire TVs. I’m also liking my new Amazon Smart Plugs. I also felt those devices were good values when on sale. The Echo Show has me less enthused."},{"reviewerName":"K.

The sound was decent and I had it hooked up to my Smartthings hub for full home automation. However, I found myself migrating more and more over to the Google ecosystem and the Home hub devices. When the 2nd Gen show came out, I decided to give it a try. I was convinced that I was going to return it the next day. Brought it home, set it up, did some research and found more about Hulu Live and it's integration with Alexa. Connected my Ring doorbell and cameras ... the next day, I did go back to Best Buy - but I bought one more of the 2nd Gen Show's and two more of the Spot devices for my boys rooms. I have disconnected all my Google devices and will be adding the 4k Fire Stick when it's released next week. Absolutely love the 2nd Show and Spot devices. The camera doesn't bother me at all because I have a $0.30 piece of plastic that is a lens cover like on my laptop - and when I am not using the camera, I slide that over the lens and no one can secretly watch us. Love the drop in feature because I now placed one of these in my mom's house is up in age. I will be disconnecting my cable subscription and using Hulu Live because I get all the local stations in addition to the cable channels that I use. That will save me over $70 per month .. and I can watch on all my Fire Stick devices, Show's, etc. Lastly, I did buy the Google Home Hub as well with the 7\" monitor ... that was the one I was convinced I would be using. However, the sound is awful compared to the Show, it's tiny and if you want to watch any sort of videos on the screen - it sucks because it's so small ...

The screen quality and video clarity are also good.\nThe bad: It takes far too long to update. For example, when you put your calendar events on your home screen, it is usually 12-24 hours behind, showing you yesterday's events. Same goes for notifications. Received an Amazon shipment and my Echo notified at 10:16am, it wasn't till 10:56am that my Echo Show gave me that info.\nThe ugly: Home screen just isn't actually prepared to display properly. If connected to your calendar, it will only show one even for the day, rather than scrolling through multiple events, requiring you to touch the screen to go into your calendar (at that point I could just be using my regular Echo device). Headlines/stories are completely random, and cut off mid sentence. So you'll see something like \"Snakes loose in the wester\" and again would have to touch the screen to dig in further. It also seems to have a much harder time hearing me that my regular Echo devices, especially if it's playing music! Additionally, it simply isn't designed to be seen from across the room; I have a small city apartment so at most I'm 10 feet away, the time and weather are tiny little dots in the corner of a an otherwise empty screen, and there's no way you'll be able to read the \"try\" scroll on the bottom of the screen unless you're right on top of it.\n\nUnless you are using this for the specific purpose of video chatting with someone else who has an Echo Show, I'd say save your money till they make the adjustments. With Google Home Hub (which unlike the Echo Show has the ability to search and play YouTube videos) only costing $150, and regular Echo devices at $100, this just feels like a missed opportunity that is over priced, not prepared for a good user experience, and overall not worth the cost!"},{"reviewerName":"K. K","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"UPDATED: Great upgrade to v1 but with caveats about how to set brightness settings for bedside use.","reviewDate":"October 23, 2018","reviewText":"Edit Nov 2, 2018.\nI've been working with Amazon support on my issues around how the device handles light level detection and how it behaves overnight when used as a bedside device. My main issues were 1) the device did not sleep as expected (so it was distracting while sleeping) and 2) the ambient light sensing mode did not work properly (it made the device VERY dark). I have some updates and feedback on Amazon's support process and where we stand.\n\nFirst, Amazon support has been excellent. They reached out to me directly to discuss the issues and have solicited my feedback and \"evidence\" (videos for example) to demonstrate the behavior. They've had their engineering team involved... so it's obvious they are taking this seriously and want to fix the issues assuming they are valid and can be validated. This is what I'd expect. I'm very happy so far.\n\nRelated to sleep mode. At night, by default, I've determined that if the \"Adaptive Brightness\" is turned on then the device will not sleep properly and will continue to cycle through the various screens prompting you for interactions. The normal stuff. If you turn \"Adaptive Brightness\" OFF then it does work. This is counter intuitive but the good news is that this mode works and resolves the issue of the device working as a bedside device, I'm happy to say.\n\nIn relation to when the Adaptive Brightness mode is ON and the device becoming too dark I am still working on validating that with support. They're serious about fixing the issue so I'm hopeful.\n\nI've raised my review rating based on the above and my genuine positive experience with the Gen2 Show outside of those issues. The audio is superb, the screen is great, and it's a great platform. I am completely willing to recommend the device now assuming folks understand the dimming issues mentioned above and how to address them. To summarize, currently:\n1. For Bedside use disable \"Adaptive Brightness\" in the display settings. This allows the device to go into sleep mode at night when next to you on a bedside table.\n2. When not used as a bedside device it's ok to use Adaptive Brightness but be aware that you may need to turn the brightness level up so that it doesn't go too dark. IF you turn AB on and the screen goes to dark just raise the brightness level as I noted.\n\nOriginal review:\nSo, I have 3 V1s and now 2 V2 Shows. I like the devices, obviously, or I wouldn't have invested in them for use around the house. The 10\" V2 is a great upgrade in most ways. Bigger screen, much better sound, some new interface features (but Echo still needs a LOT of work in this area) but it also has a nearly game breaking flaw.\n\nOn all of my V1s the screen dimming worked awesome. If it was night time and there was no activity in a room the screen would dim, intelligently, and the display would just show the clock. The idea here obviously was to reduce distractions during sleep. This made the Show a great device for the bedside. Not any more (at least for now).\n\nV2 of the show has a serious problem with dimming and \"sleep\" detection, as I would call it. There are two problems compared to the previous model:\n1. The device does not properly detect light levels, or react to them, so that if the Ambient Light sensor is \"enabled\" it will dim to an almost unreadable state if the ambient light source is behind the unit. Sometimes even if it's not. I had to turn this feature off completely as I could not see the display on my devices about half the time!\n2. The biggest flaw is that the device NO LONGER detects that a room has no activity if used at bedside (and possibly elsewhere). I spent a very restless night because the screen on my Show V2 would NOT go to \"sleep\" mode (where it completely dims and only the clock is shown) and it was SUPER annoying. I have no idea how to fix this. I cannot use the Ambient Light sensor because then I would not be able to see the device during the day much of the time. I'm puzzled.\n\nNote that I've confirmed that the V2 is using the same settings as the V1 so this should not be happening. In general... it's a big problem and if it's not resolved I may be returning the device here before too long. The bigger display and improved sound are not worth losing sleep at night."},{"reviewerName":"Tea","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Love the New Look","reviewDate":"October 19, 2018","reviewText":"I am very pleased with the new look and sound.

This thing has great potential, but it sorely needs a software update. If you think about it, it really does not do anything useful. Most of the time it just sits there. You need to be able to customize the home screen background and size of the time / weather. It could be a fantastic, basic, smart home controller, but it fails on that part. You need to be able to map addresses. You need an option to not show this \"Try\" nonsense at the bottom of the screen - that is just veiled advertising. It needs more thought put into accessibility features. I just tried: \"Alexa, show me the nearest pizza places\" as prompted by one of their \"Try …\" suggestions. It showed me 8 sample pizza offerings from different places, but did not state the distance. I tapped on one of the pizza offerings, it showed the distance, but would not let me map the location. If I want to order a pizza I would have to go to my computer – why bother with the Show?\n\n*** After 4 weeks ***\n\nThis product has so much potential, but the implementation is garbage. It should never have been released for sale. The reality is it's just a tabletop dust collector – it does nothing. Most of the time it just sits there. It would be useful if it showed the time, day, and date on the home screen. It does show the time, but the font is too small to be useful and it's not configurable. It doesn't show the day or date. It shows an icon with the current weather and temperature, but again it's too small to see across a normal-size room and it's not configurable. 90% of the screen real estate is wasted. At the bottom they have an advertisement for \"Try: Alexa…\" And this can't be removed. After the first 15 minutes of \"Wow\", this gets old really fast.\n\nThe bottom line, in its present state I definitely could not recommend it to someone. If they fixed the software with some of the many complaints you see on the Echo Devices forum, it could be really good and useful.\n\n*** After 6 months ***\n\nStill no software update. This thing just sits there. It would be useful if the clock were larger, showed the month/day/year, and got rid of that \"Try…\" nonsense that's always on the screen. Just about everyone who buys one has the same complaints, but Amazon has done nothing. They now have an Echo Show 5 which, from the pictures, looks like it addresses a few of these problems. The 2nd Gen Show will probably end up in the garbage in a few weeks. There is absolutely no way I'll be getting a Show 5."},{"reviewerName":"david frias","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great but very disappointed","reviewDate":"November 12, 2018","reviewText":"Product looks awesome and great.

PLEASE GET MAPS AND TRAVEL UPDATED."},{"reviewerName":"Mr. Fish","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Impressive device; an important link to your automated household","reviewDate":"February 12, 2019","reviewText":"This review is for the Amazon Echo Show, second generation.\nThe Echo Show 2nd generation is Amazon’s latest entry in the major “land grab” to fully automate your home. Being much more useful and refined than the Echo Show 1st edition, this device demonstrates that Amazon are good listeners; they discovered what users disliked about the first Echo Show and removed/reworked those functions and they discovered what users liked and improved those.\nFirst, if you are new to the Echo Show line, let me describe some aspects of the device this way you know what you are getting.\n\nDisplay: This new Echo Show features a larger touch screen (10.1” vs 7” on the Echo Show 1st Generation); the additional screen real estate comes in really handy for watching movies or following recipe videos. In addition, the resolution on the 2nd generation Echo Show has been bumped up to a more pleasing high definition (1280x720 resolution) from a non-hd (1024x600 resolution). The result is a very nice looking screen featuring crisp, colorful pictures and videos.\n\nSound: One of the reasons you would buy this device is to acquire a really smart speaker. The sound on this Echo Show is very nice; the engineers kept the original two speaker design, but upgraded and, for better sound disbursement, moved the speakers from the front to the sides. To help fill out the sound, they added a welcome addition, a “passive bass radiator.” Which, according to Wikipedia, is an unpowered speaker where the “Internal air pressure produced by movements of the active driver cone moves the passive radiator cone.” Or, put another way, the air moved by the two inch speakers drives the bass speaker. The result is a very enjoyable, full sound. How does the sound coming from this Echo Show compare to the sound coming from similar Bose or Sonos Bluetooth speakers? I do not have any experience with Sonos since I do not own one, but I have a Bose Sounddock and the Bose is clearly better. However, this Bose speaker is not a smart display; I can give up a little sound quality to get all this device’s other cool functionality. Anyway, the sound that is produced by this Echo Show is respectable and powerful enough to fill a medium sized room.\n\nIf you purchase this Echo Show and are disappointed in the sound, you always have the option to purchase a dedicated, high end Bluetooth speaker and pair (connect) it to your Echo Show. The result would be the best of both worlds; audiophile sound with the functionality of a smart display.\nPhysical design: The new Echo Show takes on a somewhat different form than the original Echo. Instead of being all plastic, it is covered in a pleasant and decorative tweed looking fabric. You get a choice of two colors, charcoal (dark gray) or sandstone (off white). On top of the newly redesigned show are the physical volume buttons, a mute button to mute the volume and turn off the camera and four microphones. On the front, near top of the screen bezel are four additional microphones. These eight mics do a nice job of picking up your inquiries to Alexa to perform all of her different functions. Additionally, one nice touch that will fly under the radar is the mini-usb port on the back. This will enable you, via a usb to Ethernet adapter, to connect your Echo Show to your wired Ethernet connection. Why is that important? For various reasons, people do not have solid, reliable wireless coverage in their home or they might not even have a wireless connection at all. This will help in those situations.\n\nSoftware: The area most in need of improvement is Echo Show’s software. Owing to the contentious relationship between Google and Amazon, there is no way to easily access YouTube on the Echo Show Second Generation. You can do it, but it takes effort. The Echo Show has two browsers built in; Silk and Firefox. So, you will need to ask Alexa to open Firefox (or Silk). After your browser opens, you have to navigate to YouTube. After you get into YouTube, you will need to perform a search via the onscreen keyboard. Only after that, you will see your search results and can open your video. Wouldn’t it be much easier to say “Alexa, show me YouTube videos with funny cats” and have those search results displayed on the screen? However, if you want to watch YouTube videos, there is the capability to do so.\nThat brings me to another point. You have a nice new device with a screen, but do not confuse it for a fully functioning computer. Because there are no installed programs (or apps) like on your laptop or mobile phone, functionality is more limited. For example, if you start going to different web pages via one of the browsers, it does not take long before you find pages displaying oddly—videos not playing and login boxes not working; it is all because the browsers are not the full-fledged browsers that you are used to accessing on your computer. So, just keep in mind that even though this device looks like one, it is not a computer. It excels at doing certain things like keeping your shopping list, keeping a daily planner, displaying cooking videos, accessing Amazon Prime movies, answering some basic questions and most importantly, controlling your smart home devices; it is worth owning this Echo Show just to perform these functions.\n\nZigbee Home Hub: Huh? You will see some information about the Echo Show being a Zigbee Home Hub and everyone touts it as something really important, but never really explain what is going on. Let’s take a minute here to do that. It turns out that the networking that you are using now, WiFi (802.11x), Bluetooth, and wired Ethernet are not good for all of the home networking devices that you own or will own in the near future. That is where Zigbee comes in. Zigbee uses a different networking standard (802.15.4) in order to connect all of the home automation devices that you own, think thermostats, light bulbs, plugs, security cameras and the like. Now, with all of these different devices sending signals zooming around your house, you need something to pull them all together and control all the different aspects of them—are you on, are you off, turn the temperature up, turn it down, show me the backyard camera; in order to get all these to work, you need a hub. That is where the second generation Echo Show comes in. It is a Zigbee hub which will use this new 802.15.4 network to easily setup and control all of your Zigbee compatible devices. Even though it does not sound like much, being a Zigbee hub is kind of a big deal.\nTo summarize, here are the pros and cons of the Echo Show Second Generation:\n\nPros:\n-Sharp HD touch screen\n-Nice sound, much better than any other Amazon Echo device\n-Nice integration with Amazon Prime (videos, photos, music)\n-Setup is very easy\n-Stylish look; more modern and elegant than the first generation Echo Show\n-Ability to connect to wired Ethernet\n-Zigbee home hub\n\nCons:\n-It is not a computer which you will discover if you regularly use either of the show’s built in browsers\n-Poor integration with video other than Amazon Prime video (think YouTube, Sling TV, etc.)\n-Lack of options to setup the home screen\n-A ton of skills, but many are useless\n-Supporting Z-Wave (alternate protocol to Zigbee) would have been nice"},{"reviewerName":"slvr68","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Awesome Smart Display","reviewDate":"November 5, 2018","reviewText":"Once you get past which ecosystem to commit to, make no mistake, this Smart Display is really slick.....setting aside the fact that IMHO Alexa is better in a number of ways over the Google Assistant for these purposes, and considering I own both the Google Home Hub and the Show Gen 2, I have to say that the display size of the Show Gen 2 is a huge win/+. Saying 'Alexa' is also easier and more reliable than 'OK Google' or 'Hey Google'.\n\nAs for screen quality on this unit, very nice. And the audio quality is very good. I love the fact that you can get some thumping bass from this product too. It's audio quality is sufficient to fill an entire room. All the features that Amazon advertises for this product work pretty well, to really well. It's not often that this happens.....\n\nThe home automation aspects of this Smart Display are very good, to great. It relies heavily on having the Alexa App on your smartphone, but I don't see this as a big drawback. And the Mic array is particularly adept at hearing you correctly the first time....\n\nI'm not going to do a deep dive on all the features....as Amazon's content on the site does a good job of this. For the asking price, I think it's one of the best Smart Displays released so far this year. And because I'm Prime, I get tons of content right off the bat, i.e. music, movies, apps, shopping, order updates 'Alexa', where's my stuff, etc.\n\nGoogle Home Hub sits in the bedroom.....Echo Show Gen 2 sits in the kitchen, where we spend 70% of our time. Provided Amazon continues to push updates to this unit for some time to come, I think this experience will only get better and better! Can't wait."},{"reviewerName":"Scott C.

I listen to Pandora pretty much all day long on the Show in my office and for the size and footprint of it the sound quality is great. I will say the one thing I noticed, as far as audio goes, when you ask Alexa to turn up/down the volume vs. using the button the voice command jumps what seems to be a couple steps and I find myself having to go over and turn it down manually if it has gotten too loud.

When I tried to display a recipe, it continued to time out between when I glanced at the screen, completed a step, and returned to see what was next. With egg- or floured-covered hands, it was an extremely frustrating process that led me to print the recipe anyway.\n\nBeyond those experiences, my Echo Show has sat dormant, which is very unusual for a new toy.

Reuters was what I tried. It plays, but then I ask Alexa to exit. Instead of stopping, it simply shuts off the video, but the audio continues to play. Seriously, this is annoying. I tried a few recipe skills and they were quite clumsy, difficult to exit and one even wanted me to sign up online. Hello, I want to do everything on the Show, not go to some website. Why is this so complicated? The constant stream of various headlines and \"trending topics\" is annoying. Can I shut them off? I have yet to figure that out. So, with all the hype on developing a \"delightful user experience\" why do we have to start from zero with a new medium/platform?

They had a Dot before, so they weren't totally new to the devices. I had showed them how to call me on the Dot, and they used it to call other family members too.\n\nOnce we got the Shows in both homes, it wasn't long before they were dropping in on me on a regular basis. I thought, at first, that it might be intrusive but there is a CLEAR tone that someone is dropping in and you have about 15-30 seconds before the view comes in to focus.\n\nI love it. They just dropped in to find out when we would be traveling to see them. My mom told me about the cookies she made and I could see my dad eating them LOL. I like to be able to drop in on them to see how they are. When I'm away from home, I like to drop in on my own house to see what's going on and make sure it's all OKAY there.\n\nIt might take a bit to get your elderly parents set up on the Show but it's totally worth it. You can restrict access to certain times or completely. It's done by contact, not device. You can also set it up to go to your cell phone, I believe, with the Alexa app.\n\nSo, my update is not just about the device itself (but the newest Show is AWESOME ... I didn't know if it was worth upgrading but it IS) but also about it's functionality with faraway loved ones :)\n\nThe sound is AMAZING! A huge step up from the previous Show.

Here’s why I have both:\n\nThe Echo Show (2nd generation) exceeds the Portal + in overall functionality. It provides all of the features of the previous model and more. I wanted some (or all) of my primary devices to sometimes act as a PA & also be able to use the ‘Drop in’ feature when I am not home. I live in a condo and have an 8wk old puppy coming. Though I work from home, at some point if I need to go on a run or leave for an hour or two, I am still able to access the camera and speak to her if she’s barking at the front door. For now, Facebook Portal does not have this feature. With the Echo Show there is also no need for an external hub for most of my smart devices because it’s built right in. I’m unsure if Portal has this. With the Show, there is also direct access to the internet. Just ask Alexa to play movie trailers, Prime videos, etc. The display is nice, but I would chalk up the video calling and ‘Drop in’ quality to better than that of my security cameras (also high quality).\n\nThe Facebook Portal+ display and AI camera technology far exceeds that of any other device I’ve used. I purchased this for the calling feature - which is its’ primary function. During a call, you no longer need to employ being your own camera man during the call - it’s completely hands-free and smoothly follows you around the room like a movie director. I was impressed by the range at which it accurately followed me and will even follow in the direction of your voice if you happen to step out of the frame. Very limited on other functions though and I expect more are soon to follow within the year once the ‘data breach’ blah blah stuff calms down a bit. Though the Portal does not support the PA & ‘Drop in’ functions that the Echo Show has, I can still control all of my smart home devices & groups with ease and employ all of my routines with no problem.\n\nIf you’re looking for all-around functionality and more features the Echo Show (2nd) is the way to go. If quality video calling is the priority, then you can’t beat the Portal+ for now - it far exceeds everything else in that arena."},{"reviewerName":"Alex","rating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Completely Incompetent for Anything But The Most Basic Inquiries","reviewDate":"December 31, 2018","reviewText":"The Amazon Echo has not improved at all in voice recognition since the first generation.

But now Twitch isn't being shown, so I say \"resume Twitch\" ... it goes to the purple Twitch home screen \"X channels you follow are online. Would you like to see them?\" no. when I say resume Twitch I want you to !@&*(&#^&*^ resume what was playing before I asked what the weather was.\n\nThis is so basic functionality it's not even funny.\n\nTo continue the story, I then proceed to say \"Ask twitch for <streamer>\" TWENTY TIMES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! To which EVERY TIME Alexa says \"I dont' recognize that streamer name\" then other times it opens up Wikipedia to something completely unrelated that I DID NOT SAY. So I end up resorting to asking it to open Twitch and then tapping the options on screen as if I'm using a Tablet, completely defeating the purpose of a FREAKING VOICE ASSISTANT.\n\nNow a more simpler thing. With Google Home you can say \"Turn on the energize\" and it knows it's in whatever room it's in so it will turn on the lights with that scene in that room. Or you can say \"Turn on the energize everywhere\" and it will turn that scene on in every room in the house. OR you can say \"Turn on the energize in the dining room\" while in the bedroom.\n\nAlexa? Not a chance. I mean yes. You set up rooms. Yes. You put Alexa in a certain room. No. She doesn't seem to know what room she's in nor can she turn on ANYTHING in that room without you being AS FULLY EXPLICIT.. \"Turn on the energize in the bedroom\" .. even though you're in the bedroom, because saying \"Turn on the energize\" is met with \"There are multiple devices with that name, can you tell me which one you want?\" then it's like defusing a bomb, because saying the natural response to that question \"<name of device>\" is met with \"I'm sorry. I didn't understand that.\"\n\nBasically you have to GIVE IT THE FULL COMMAND as if it has absolutely ZERO understanding of language or anything else. In other words it's primitive as a straw hut in the middle of the jungle.\n\nAmazing idea, implemented boneheadedly awful. And sad to say this is why other devices are running circles around it. For all the features that Echo Show is supposed to have, it is ruined by it's complete incompetence at voice control.\n\nAnd once you realize that you cannot even REMOTELY talk to it like you'd talk to something that even TRIES to mimick human conversation, it still won't understand you half the time, as evidence by me telling it to go to the streamer that I just said once and it understood and then it fails to understand twelve times and I have to actually just press buttons to get there because the voice command is garbage.\n\nI pre-ordered the first Amazon Echo and still have it. The voice command has not improved AT ALL since then. Having a continue mode where it listens again for a follow up command is NOT better speech recognition. It's just code.\n\nYou need better AI, by like a billion lightyears of a long shot. If it didn't perform the basic functions of controlling the lights etc. with learnable , though less convenient commands, I would return it.\n\nI don't even want to install additional skills on it because my experience using it to watch Twitch has probably taken ten years off my life. I'll just use the computer the old fashioned way because IT WORKS."},{"reviewerName":"fickledee","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Issues issues issues","reviewDate":"December 10, 2018","reviewText":"I got this so I could monitor my father at his home.

Good idea but needs to be simplified to work and set up. One should be able to set it up on EITHER phone or PC web page. There needs to be consistency between alexa.amazon.com and the app as far as contacts are concerned or it needs to propagate immediately.

Flanagan","rating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Waiting for updates","reviewDate":"January 12, 2019","reviewText":"I have had multiple Echo devices, including the first generation Show. This is definitely an improvement on that, bigger screen, better music and sound, and video. However, more than any other single function, we use it as a digital picture frame. The background picture, when the device isn't being used for something else, can be set to an album that you have created on Amazon Photos. We loaded 400 or so photos, and they change at about one minute, which I think is a perfect time.\n\nThere are a couple of problems, though. First, the units have a tendency to stop and stay at one picture, until the unit is unplugged and plugged in again. This has been mentioned time and time again in reviews, but the Amazon team on this project has apparently either not prioritize it, or can't fix it. Expect this to continue until they make it a priority.\n\nThe second issue with this as a digital picture frame is that there's no customization, other than selecting the album. Pictures rotate chronologically, either by date taken or date uploaded. You cannot shuffle or randomize. So if you took a bunch of photos at a birthday party or wedding, you are going to see all of those pictures in succession, before it moves on to another. It's gotten to the point where I can predict what the next pictures going to be.\n\nAlso in the category of lack of customization – there is no effects that you can use with these pictures. There is no transition choice – fade,, wipe, side – nor were there any effects that can be used (Ken Burns, etc.) Amazon doesn't give you any kind of slideshow maker, and it doesn't support any third-party apps.\n\nIn the general category of Alexa – the skills have now become like Apple's app store. You can't find anything useful unless you read something about it somewhere. It suggests skills, based on one's you have already enabled. We tried that once. \"Big sky\" is a weather app that's pretty good. Around Christmas time, it was suggested that if we like that, we would like something called \"Sky Weather\". So I enabled it by voice. And then opened it. It went on for about two minutes. And Alexa did not appear to hear me calling for it to stop, so I had to scream. No more suggestions.\n\nMy home isn't smart enabled, so I'm not going to comment on its usefulness on that front. The recipes are definitely helpful, but I don't think I'll be watching much video on it. Simply finding your Amazon purchases can take time, and there's only a limited number of them that show. Finally, the \"drop in\". Nice idea, but these are usually going to be sitting on kitchen counters or side tables. You're going to have to squat down. In an age where everybody has an iPhone or iPad and Facetime is available, it's an inferior redundancy. (Oh, and it can be really annoying. I gave these to 2 sisters and a niece at Christmas. One of the sisters sent me a message. Suddenly, the Echo Dot next to my head started glowing and fading, glowing and fading. I couldn't figure out what the hell it was. So I could sleep, I just unplugged it. Next day, I saw other Dots glowing and fading, and went into the Show to find out what the heck was going on. Apparently it was the message, and it doesn't stop until you read it. Thanks, but I think I'll stick to texting.\n\nThey still haven't found the homerun app for this device. For us right now, it's pretty much a $229 picture frame that doesn't do everything we would like it to do."},{"reviewerName":"KajeX","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"No Sound???

I was connected to tech support who this time had me unplug the power cord from the back of the Echo Show and leave it unplugged for two minutes. Afterwards, she had me plug it back in. It now worked.\n\nI'm very happy with this device now, but have some serious concerns about its durability and longevity since it could not work right out of the box.

Since countless reviews have focused on the big and beautiful screen, my comments are added here:\n1. No doubt this is a gorgeous screen. The small clock typeface has been fixed, although much to my surprise, there is little to no clock customization. Worse, the only background \"themes\" are the simplistic (and very tiring) \"illustrations\" and no background at all. What happened to the wonderful photos I have on my Show 1st Generation? This is Amazon's star product; I would have expected all kinds of new customization features and details. I settled for my folder \"Album\" of various photos that I have in my Amazon Photos app. Just say \"Alexa, add this album to my background\" and they will cycle every 1 minute or so (and no, there does appear to be any way to cycle these any faster...). Any yes, as another reviewer stated, an entirely different background pops up with an ad or notification.\n2. The loud Alexa voice has been fixed I have read. I don't really like the side and rear speaker placement however - poor Alexa sounds as if she is within a box. The sound is indeed louder with an accentuated bass (and a three-level equalizer, woohoo!) but the music is missing a clear location. It sounds diffuse and non-distinct.\n3. The worst surprise was this irritating screen-goes-blank after 2 minutes feature, which is carried over from the 1st Generation. Why does this happen? I can no longer see lyrics or title or the art after the screen dies. Arrgghh.\n4. No Youtube. We all know why but that doesn't make it any better. And no, the Silk/Firefox work-around is just stupid. Just make up (Google and Amazon) and bring the native YouTube back!\n\nIn retrospect, I'm glad I have them both. The 2nd Generation will take over the kitchen and the 1st Generation goes with me to work.\n\nWhy all the critical comments despite the 4-stars? Because the new Echo Show is placed right next to my Lenovo Smart Display, which has a seamless Youtube and great sound/screen as well. The 2nd Generation Echo Show is just so much nicer than the Smart Display which was one of the biggest disappointments for me in 2018.\n\nAmazon can quickly fix most of all these nit-picking comments in future updates.

The original show was pretty dated looking so I skipped it, but the (2nd gen) Echo Show looks so much better.\n\nSoftware:\nThis is the biggest problem with the Echo Show so I'm leading with it. The software is really designed poorly. If it has a huge 10\" touch screen, why not design the software to let you use touch AND voice. Want to go to a website? You can't just click on a browser, you have to ask it to \"Open Firefox\" or \"Open Silk\". Want to quickly pull up a list of your timers currently running? You can't, you have to ask it. Want to search from a Prime Movie to watch while cooking? You have to do it with your voice and it's very cumbersome. If you're watching a video and want to set a timer, it closes out the video. When a timer is running, it's not always displayed, so you are left wondering how much time is left and have to ask her. When you use it as a photo frame (using the Prime Photos app on your phone or computer) the photo you use is muted (no where near as nice looking as it is on the Google Home Hub) and it's constantly you to \"Try asking Alexa to....\". The whole thing is really poorly designed from a visual perspective. Thankfully that can be solved with software updates if Amazon tries.\n\nDisplay:\nThe screen is beautiful and viewable from anywhere in the room. I find it to be a good size, in fact, it was one of the reasons I didn't go with the Google Home Hub. With a 7\" screen, that was just too small to be useful.\n\nSound:\nIt's a huge upgrade from my Echo Dot. It has a nice full sound and I rarely have the volume over 40%.\n\nVoice Control:\nIt does a great job at hearing the call phrase \"Alexa\" from anywhere in the room and even in adjacent rooms\n\nOverall, it's a good device with a lot of potential. Hardware-wise, it's top notch. Beautiful display, great sound, fits in well in a kitchen. The software is just lacking. You have to wonder if the people who designed it ever tried to use it on a regular basis.

Sound quality on Show 5, far better than the Spot.\n\nScreens on both devices far more useful than their predecessors. If you are trading in Spots, be aware that the Amazon base for the Spot will work perfectly on the Show 5. Saved us $20 x 2! Base is highly recommended if using for a nightstand clock unless your nightstand is lower than your viewing angle. Ability to have large clock on Show 5 is excellent for trying to view without the glasses at night. FAILURE to allow for a large clock on the 2nd Gen - for instance if using for a kitchen clock with photo background like the Show 5 has - inexcusable at almost 3x the price. Fix this Amazon. Clock on the 2nd Gen is unreadable across a large room which is a complete waste of that beautiful new large screen. I would like to have a slide show background behind a large analog clock, for instance. Perfect for the kitchen or family room.\n\nShow 5 has a clock shutter - great for a bedroom clock. 2nd Gen is missing a clock shutter. Why? If you are setting the 2nd Gen on a shelf - in a family room for instance - be aware that if you intend to do video dropins you will need a base to lower the angle unless you like looking at the ceiling. The angle on these was designed for standing at the kitchen counter (just as long as you don't care that you can't see the clock) or sitting bolt upright at a desk with the device in front of you at arm's length. Any other height/angle combinations and you are going to need the base to get a proper view of the room. These devices are vast improvements over their predecessors - but - several missed opportunities for simple softrware value adds.\n\nGlad to own these, but waiting anxiously for software fixes for some obvious misses on the 2nd Gen. The top of the line should have ALL of the features of the lesser devices available, not a subset of the Show 5.

When motion is detected or a doorbell press happens, you should have the option to have the Show automatically display the Ring camera that's reporting in.\n\nWeb video: I had aims to use the device to watch Youtube videos and read about the workarounds that exist for the device inexplicably not having a Youtube app (due to some Amazon tiff with Google). I thought I could get around this by using the integrated browsers, but this really doesn't work well. The browsers seem to expunge cookies every time you switch to the home screen, so you get logged out. Youtube, Youtube TV and DirecTV online viewing are basically non-starters. Who the heck uses Hulu?\n\nAudio mic: Our old first gen Alexa (not the show version) had no issues understanding us when being asked to do something. This gen 2 Alexa Show has a much harder time picking up requests and many times we have to repeat the requests multiple times before it figures it out.\n\nLack of recipe content: There are tons of simple recipes that I ask for that just aren't found.

My grandmother regularly becomes confused and aggravated after having been prompted to do stupid things (\"Try, 'Echo' play Seinfeld on Hulu\" prompting her to sign up for the service) or emotionally irresponsible things (\"Try, 'Echo' call Mom?\" which prompted me to have to explain to her that infact her mother had died years ago, again.)\n\nIt is stupid that I have to leave an emotional review about this, there should be a menu option to remove text prompts, the online forums are full of this complaint but Amazon is too busy abusive warehouse workers and monopolizing cloud storage for all mainstream internet use."},{"reviewerName":"DOAbarrelroll","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Wasted Potential","reviewDate":"January 20, 2019","reviewText":"While the hardware is very nice -- loud, clear speakers, decent camera, large, bright screen with good viewing angles, unobtrusive design -- the biggest selling point for the Echo Show over the other Echo family of devices as is needlessly underutilized: The screen, while nice, is an afterthought.\n\nThe majority of all functions will only give you an audio response only, even if there easy to find corresponding video available from the same sources the Echo Show is pulling from -- news briefing from different media outlets, as an example. For video streaming, the big players either aren't available or require jumping through several hoops in order to get them to function. If you'd like to utilize the device as a digital picture frame, you're able to use Amazon Photo -- a thing no actually uses as far as I can tell -- but unable to link the device to any image services or accounts which people actually use.\n\nMost of my gripes there aren't necessarily Amazon's fault as other companies are certainly under no obligation to create skills linking to their services for the Echo Show, particularly when many of them are direct competitors of Amazon and their services. It's unfortunate and frustrating, but it is what it is.\n\nMy main complaint is one which Amazon has no one to point a finger at but itself: The screen is 10\" worth of unused space 90% of the time, with only 1/12 of the area being used to display the sort of information you'd want at a glance on an always-on display. It shows you the current time and temperature, but there is currently no way to customize or add additional information. Not the current day or date, upcoming scheduled appointments, particular stocks, moon cycle or whatever other info you might want at a glance.\n\nTo repeat, this $230 always-on display does not allow you to have the current day or date displayed. You need to ask Alexa to tell you this information. There is less information display on a 10\" display than what is offered on the ~1\" screen of you smartwatch of choice. There is no way to customize this information. This is less functionality than your average digital clock. To add insult to injury, apparently the ability to display the current day and date IS available on the Echo Spot for $100 less.\n\nThis may seem to a minor issue, and largely I think it is. But it speaks to the sort of decisions -- or lack thereof -- being made with this device as a whole. Amazon hit gold with the original Echo and decided to slap a screen on it, but don't seem to know what to do with the screen, even when it comes down to the most basic functionality.\n\nIf these sort of things are added in a future update, I will happily change this review."},{"reviewerName":"texellence","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Not for watching amazon prime","reviewDate":"June 26, 2019","reviewText":"I wanted a small screen that would play amazon prime movies and television shows. The reason is to be able to fall asleep to shows I already know (basically, bore myself to sleep) and that would not have a lot of flickering light levels. I have and echo show 1 which would --after all kinds of machinations---allow me to get to prime television, and would automatically take you to something, but not anything you asked for. Then you can try to back out and get to what you want. I wanted Murder, She Wrote, for example. It just kept saying it could not find it. If you could get to something you wanted, it would boot you out after a short while. So I decided to get the Echo Show 2. Same thing! I finally called support since this is the same behavior my echo show 1 was exhibiting so I figured software, not hardware. I spent a long time on the phone, and the fellow finally agreed that these just don't work for what I want it for. He could not get the machine at his premises to do anything I was asking. He thought it might be the comma in the tv show title. He said he would do a write up on it and someone should be in touch with me when solved. After a couple of weeks I just returned it since I heard nothing. The good news is, this was a refurb and it DID include the power cord that many said were missing from their refurbished purchase.

This was on sale for a solid price. I’ve been using echo devices since the first one came out in early 2016. And it’s still in use over 3 years later.\n\nI really like this 2nd generation so far.\n\nThe initial process to get it going took maybe 20 or so minutes because it had updates.\n\nWhat do I like about this over the 1st generation? Here is a few things:\n\n1. The sound. The sound is a lot more fuller for the room that it’s in. The bass is substantially better. It fills the room with plentiful sound. I live in a attached home and probably wouldn’t put it past 40 percent or so. The thing Gets LOUD.\n\n2. The screen. It’s about 3 inches bigger than the first gen. And it’s way more vibrant. Although my ring camera footage is a bit grainy to be honest. I feel like it might be a bit better on the 1st gen. But most things the extra real estate really helps. If you have weak vision like I do, it really helps you see the screen from the other side of the room.\n\n3. Most of the Same features in a bigger form factor. Still has the same home screen as the 1st gen. I have always enjoyed the home screen. I look at the days headlines as well as the time and current temperature. I have a smart home I guess you can say. I like that I can check my Ring cameras and get a visual view of the current brightness on my Hue light bulbs. Initially I was hesitant about getting one with the screen, but I really do love it. Also things like song lyrics and answers to questions give you something visual to look at rather than just hearing it\n\nI noticed that this uses about 30 or so percent more power. Echo show 1st gen has a 21W AC adapter and this 2nd gen uses 30W. But if you factor in the extra 3 or so inches for the screen, the 9 watt increase seems about right.\n\nSo that’s just a few things that I have observed. I will try to update my review over time.\n\nPersonally I probably wouldn’t of bought it at MSRP price. Echo devices drop in price pretty quick. The lower price point influenced my decision. Lastly, I will continue to use my Older Echo devices because they seem to last a while. They just don’t go bad after a year or so.\n\nOverall good buy for me. 2nd generation has improved on several things for sure."},{"reviewerName":"Adam","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"It's an exercise in frustration with some glimmers of greatness","reviewDate":"May 9, 2019","reviewText":"I've had the Echo Show for a month now and there are things I like which are pretty much the things I like about any Echo device (I have 4 now). I like being able to access Apple Music from almost any room in the house and listen to almost any song I can think of. I had hoped the Echo Show would be the same for video. Sadly no.\n\nI replaced the Echo in my kitchen with the Show. I wanted to be able to watch the news or a TV show while cooking which is something I love to do. A glass of red wine, watching a dumb action movie and making a nice dinner is my idea of heaven.\n\nUnfortunately, beyond the limitations of only having easy access to Prime video and Hulu (you can access YouTube and Netflix more manually), the real problem is the impreciseness of the voice controls. I've spent the last 15 minutes trying to figure out how to watch Season 4 of the Vikings on my Echo Show. Hulu has it, but everytime I ask to watch, \"Vikings Season 4, episode 1\" the Show brings up the correct search and offers to stream it through Prime or Hulu. Perfect, right?\n\nNo, because although the search says Vikings Season 4, Episode 1 - if I select Hulu then I get Season 1, Episode 1. If I select Prime, I get the 1960's movie with Kurt Douglas (admittedly great but I've seen it a bunch). Herein lies the problem, I can't get to the content I want through the clumsy interface and simply opening Hulu ONLY shows a very limited selection of things to watch. 1st world problems, I know, but still.\n\nBasically, the Echo Show has me getting mad at Alexa all the time.

Honestly, it knew which WiFi network to use and the password (assume Amazon has it stashed in the cloud somewhere under my name). So that was nice.\n\nWatching Prime video works fairly well, but it can be hard to get exactly what you want without interacting with the touch screen (or possibly the remote, haven't tried that for anything but volume). On some shows and movies, it insists on bringing up a list of episodes, which can be scrolled through by intoning \"next\" and \"previous\" over and over. Other content plays immediately, picking up wherever I left off.\n\nHooked up Hulu as well, and telling the thing to \"watch Seinfeld\" worked automatically, bypassing Amazon Video where I don't have the rights. It picked up where I last left off and was able to advance episodes with \"next episode\", but \"previous episode\" unceremoniously dumped me on a Hulu list. Saying \"next episode\" on last episode put on to another series that is apparently part of \"My Stuff\" on Hulu.\n\nAdded the Echo Recast for off-the-air, which also works fairly well, but oddly enough it tries to launch Hulu to watch CBS. That doesn't work as I don't have Hulu Live. Oddly, NBC loads right up and ABC presents a poser: use Recast or Hulu. Telling it \"1\" for Recast works, but it would be nice if it would remember such decisions (with an interface to reset defaults). Using the \"channel guide\" command shows all of the expected channels (including CBS), so it's a bit of a mystery as to why it thinks CBS is only available on Hulu.\n\nAs for YouTube, the first command I tried was \"watch cat videos\" to see how bad the YT experience would be (thanks to a feud between Google and Amazon). Should have realized that the command didn't invoke YT at all. Later on asking for YT content, I was asked to choose between Silk or Firefox browsers. Choosing the former allowed for using YT through the touch screen. Suspect content integration is non-existent, though it should be able to at least search. Haven't bothered as YT is mostly a waste of time anyway.\n\nInterfaces with the usual Alexa suspects of shopping (of course), checking the calendar, managing lists, setting alarms and timers, listening to music (now with lyrics), reading Kindle books, etc. are enhanced considerably by the screen. Phone calls worked as expected with an added visual interface; same for home automation. However, it seems that most 3rd party skills do not take advantage of the screen.\n\nSpeaking of home automation, I don't see a visual interface for setting scenes, but suspect they will work through voice.\n\nNo sign of notifications. Every other Alexa device I have lights up and beeps to indicate a new message. Would seem like a no-brainer to put these on the screen. Or perhaps the rotating display on the home screen covers these sorts of missives (mostly shopping related).\n\nSound is great, video looks great as well (though 720p I think).\n\nCertainly this is the best alarm clock ever."},{"reviewerName":"Robert S.

However, the one thing I bought it for was to be able to watch TV on it. I own two firesticks which work great, all you do is download the app for the channel you want then connect with your TV provider, but this is where the Echo Show gets stuck. I try to watch a channel and when I get to the screen to select my provider it doesn't react. I see my provider available in the list, I tap on it and nothing.

This defect appeared in my 1st generation Show about six months after purchase. What happens is that a loud click or pop can be heard when the audio activates. Ask Alexa a question and you hear a pop before and immediately after the response. Play music or a podcast or any audio/video source, and within 5 minutes of starting, sometimes earlier, the pop/click appears randomly, though as the video clip shows it occurs on average about every 10 seconds while there is an audio source. You can avoid this distraction by using a bluetooth speaker, but my point of contention is that this is a defect that has not been addressed by the manufacturer. I purchased a 2nd generation Show before this issue cropped up with my 1st generation one so I can only hope that the defect has been addressed in the 2nd generation. If this issue were addressed I could easily give this product 5 stars since it has so many advantages over the various dots that I also own. I will not, however, be replacing them until I am convinced that this serious audio defect is addressed and corrected."},{"reviewerName":"Gary Anderson","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Screen Options Stink!","reviewDate":"May 18, 2019","reviewText":"This product could be great.

The full screen presentation of the 2nd gen combined with the speaker moved to the rear is a winner and in my opinion, that alone is worth the upgrade but then I just like new electronics.

From that very first Echo speaker tryout invitation to the 1st generation Echo show, I fell in love with Alexa products. So, when they announced a larger screen Echo Show, I pre-ordered like most people. I have had the product for a while now, and I must say that I am a bit disappointed.\n\nCons\n\nThe problems with the video feature.\n\nFirst --- Alexa voice recognition on that is lacking. It takes more than one try to get the right video to play. I never had that issue with the first generation Echo Show.\n\nSecond --- Alexa does not pause or stop the video on command. I have tried several commands such as “Alexa, Pause!”, “Alexa, Pause the video!”, “Alexa, Stop!”, “Alexa, stop the video!.” The only thing that works is to command Alexa to play a song, then command it to stop the song. I wrote Amazon about this and never got an answer. I am not sure why, Amazon used to be so good at answering those questions, but this time around, I got no help.\n\nThird --- Alexa does not pick up where you left off. When I get up and use the screen to pause a video when I come back the entire video is gone, and the screen is back to normal. I then have to ask Alexa to play the video again. This would not have been a problem, but if it is a show that you are re-watching, you have to remember the specific season and episode you were watching to ask Alexa to play for you. It is a frustrating issue and still need improvement.\n\nPro\n\nI love the sound system. I know that at the beginning people were complaining, I guess I lucked out because I never had an issue with the sound of the Echo show. I never go higher than volume 5 because I tried volume 10 once and it gets really loud. If a song with bass is playing, you can hear the bass super clear.\n\nAlexa can respond well to many commands as its past contender. It can show you what you need to see or read it to you. I do not use the Audiobook feature because I do not like audiobooks. However, I did ask it to read me a book to see if it works. Alexa can only read you specific books. You must give it the title of the book in order for it to work. There are skills available for children that can select more random books. I have tried the Amazon Storytime feature, and it can read you random bedtime stories, which is cool. I wish there were one for adults, that can just read random books as asked but that just me being picky.\nI love the fabric cover of the New Echo Show. My very first Echo show, I had to buy a cover to prevent it from being scratched and looking worn. The new fabric feature is perfect and easier to clean.\n\nOverall, despite the drawbacks of the video feature, I will highly recommend the Echo Show 2. I use it often and still watch some shows and newsreel on it. I am sure, as past experiences have shown, that Amazon will soon correct those issue with the Echo. So, don't be afraid to invest in one."},{"reviewerName":"David M.

It's pretty nice. A digital photo frame.\n\nThe thing that SUCKS about it is that for every 3 or 4 of my photos that get displayed, Alexa inserts a photo of some prepared food dish and offers me the recipe. If I WANT recipes, I know how to find them online. I don't need them popping up every 30 seconds in my family slideshow. What the hell is wrong with Amazon? First, they ignore the THOUSANDS of complaints about the \"thing to try\" bullshit, and now they hijack your personal slides to show you pictures of food!\n\nI know Jeff Bezos isn't interested in my advice on how to sell products, but these stupid, annoying features should, at the very least, be optional.

Bottom line up front: No sound comes out of this one, and yes, the volume is up and I've tried completely resetting it.\n\nI had the 1st-generation Echo Show, and its screen wavered and flickered incessantly (but unfortunately, that problem did not show up until after 30 days). I sent it back to be fixed, but all the \"genius\" Amazon techs did was reset it...which worked for about 30 minutes. Good job, Amazon techs!\n\nNow this second one, a 2nd generation, doesn't work out of the box. Alexa acts like it's working. In other words, if you ask for the forecast, it'll show up as text on screen but there is no acknowledgement or sound. If you ask it to play music, the scroll bar will appear and be moving (and if she knows the lyrics, they'll display on the screen), but again, no sound.\n\nYes the volume is up, and I've tried unplugging and replugging, and a factory reset. (As a technical-type person, I can already tell you that the odds that a factory reset would fix this issue—or the earlier one with the flickering screen—asymptotically approach zero. That is, Amazon is just wasting your time when they recommend that for issues like this.)\n\nI would not recommend an Echo Show to my worst enemy, although they might indeed make a great torture device.\n\nSummary: Do not buy! And avoid at all costs. Amazon simply does not know how to make reliable devices with screens. (I have a non-screen Echo, and it's worked fine for years.)

How about with the Good:\n\nScreen - nice size, bright and vivid\n\nSound - nice, room-filling sound\n\nUnit design - nice aesthetics, but functionally lacking without a stand\n\n-\n\nAs far as the Bad or weak points, there are quite a few, but fortunately these *could* be resolved with policy or software changes:\n\nPerformance - overall, it's a fairly sluggish compared to my other devices. This could be issues with code, hardware or servers - there's no way I can say for sure either way. Hopefully, it's something that can be remedied on the AMZ side.\n\nScreen - there's not much to watch on it. Or rather, it's really hard to find anything worth watching. Your choices are Amazon Video or Hulu.\n> No Netflix\n> No casting from other devices\n> No Plex video (music works fine)\n> No SlingTV (we're a Sling house, not a Hulu house)\n> No YouTube (note - there's a workaround to get to YT by using an included browser, but it's slow and awkward.\n\nAdditionally, finding what you want on Amazon Video is painful on this device. Videos I can easily locate on a phone, tablet or set top box are nearly impossible to locate.\n\nAll in all, it feels a lot more like the Fire Phone than it does a Fire tablet, in that it seems geared more to sell stuff than it is to meet consumers needs or demands .\n\nUnit design - as a counter-top device, it REALLY needs to be up off the counter a bit more. Otherwise, there's a good chance that at some point a spill will ruin it. I bought the ATOPHK stand for an additional $44 (ouch!). It's a great stand, but something like this really should be included with a \"premium\" product like this that is meant for the table/counter.\n\nI bought this Echo Show because I love gadgets, but only because it was on sale. I wouldn't have purchased it at full price and, having bought it and experienced it's limitations first-hand, I'm not sure I would buy it again until the functionality/compatibility is expanded significantly. As it stands, a $29 Echo Dot connected to my home system via bluetooth has 90+% of the value I get from the Show.\n\nYour mileage and desired usage may vary!\n\nNote to Amazon: I *really* want to like this a lot more than I do. Tweak up the speed and give me more access to other sources and you'll have a 6-star product.\n\n--\n\n.:: 3-month update ::.\n\nThe above observations and opinions are unchanged, both good and bad. But I've found something else that I think is worth mentioning. I found that video surveillance of any kind is slow / delayed significantly. I've tried BlinkXT2's, as well as several budget-friendly Dericam cameras (via Monocle) and both had a serious 12-18 second delay on the Echo Show. For instance, the pizza delivery guy was ringing my doorbell before I saw his car pull in my drive.\n\nThere is nearly no delay when viewing the same video streams from either camera on the phone apps, both on wifi and off. Also, network monitoring shows my bandwidth is far from saturated. That being the case, I can say with a fair bit of certainty the issue is with the Show and not the cameras or network. My guess is there's a shoddy x264 codec in there somewhere, or the overall hardware's just not up to the task.\n\nEither way, I'm keeping it at 3 stars for the looks and sound quality, but I'm still largely unimpressed."},{"reviewerName":"Eli Manning's #1 Fan","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Review Based On If You Are A Echo Show 1st Edition Owner..","reviewDate":"July 14, 2019","reviewText":"This review is solely based on my thoughts and advantages of upgrading to the new Echo Show 2.\n\nUpgrade Pros:\n- Sound Quality\n- Bigger Screen\n\nOutside of those two factors regards the Echo Show 2 I don’t see any further justification that would fall into upgrading your original Show to the Echo Show 2.\n\nI did not see much a a listening skill improvement as sometimes I have to speak up to get Alexa to listen. I did get a lot more of “sorry, which device?” From Alexa when both Shows connected and yes they were of different rooms. I also have the Echo as well 2nd gen. I had issues with some skill sets built in with New Echo making connection or recognizing the demand.. Such as Apple Music , in which works perfect with my original Show but after connecting both, it seemed that I was consistently receiving the quote “ I cannot play Apple Music at this time” a lot.\n\nSo I asked myself is it worth just to upgrade to a tablet size screen?

There's no way to select it on the screen and after opening Hulu you can't tell it to \"Play season 2 episode 10 of ......\". It just plays the first episode of a season. If you tell it to play the next episode it just restarts the episode your on. Seems a tablet may be better suited for my needs but then Amazon shouldn't advertise that it works with Hulu. I also don't like that you cannot turn off the suggestions on the screen so when you have photos as your background there's always text across them. Makes me feel like I paid to advertise for Amazon in my home. A lot of the skills need much more fine tuning to be user friendly. For example Ring has a skill so I can see who's at my front door on the device but it takes several seconds to connect as it connects through the website. By that time I've already gone to answer it or pulled it up on my phone much quicker.

Just not sure that you NEED it.","reviewDate":"April 19, 2019","reviewText":"As the headline mentions, this is a great device that is excellent at what it does. Its mics and Alexa integration are every bit as good as the audio-only Echos. Its audio quality is outstanding. My favorite use for mine is as a speakerphone when working from home in combination with my Echo Connect and home phone service. The screen is beautiful as well. Basically, I have no real complaints. If you're heavily invested in the Amazon ecosystem and can spare the $$, I think you'll find this to be a very nice compliment.\n\nHOWEVER... I put this squarely in the camp of \"nice to have\" vs a real MUST have. It's not cheap. If you're looking to integrate Alexa into your home, you can quite literally put her in every room via the excellent 3rd gen Echo Dots and still have plenty of spare change vs the cost of one of these. While the display interface is nice enough, other than answering calls, I seldom find myself interacting with it because it's just as quick to ask for the simple things I need (ex.- Weather, Home lighting, Security cam feeds, etc.) by voice. It's mostly a nice enough photo frame with an excellent speaker. Having said that, the G**gle Home Hub that currently sits next to it is a far better picture frame due to its Ambient mode lighting adjustments and has the killer feature of Chromecast support. Almost any app not natively supported by the device itself can be casted over to the Home hub's display, and the HH can be integrated into more than one group for home audio playback (vs only a single group per device for the Amazon ES).\n\nIn summary, it really comes down to your own individual needs/wants and whether or not you've bought into either ecosystem. If you're already bought into the Google ecosystem, this one isn't for you. If you're a Google Play Music and/or heavy Youtube user with an Android phone, it isn't for you. BUT... If you love Alexa, it is. If you're looking for the one, killer device to bring Alexa into your home, this is it. If you want multiples and have a large house to cover, maybe you should start with the audio-only Echos and work your way up unless you get a killer price on one of these. All in all, Amazon did a great job with what they have here, and I'm confident they'll continue to improve it within the confines of what they can do as compared to Google."},{"reviewerName":"Dennis M","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"AWESOME !!!","reviewDate":"July 8, 2019","reviewText":"We use one Echo Show (2nd Gen) downstairs and the other in our master bedroom to control lighting, front & garage door locks, Nest smart thermostats (2), Ring front door-bell camera, etc ... they have allowed us to retrofit, integrate and otherwise update our home into a \"smart home\".

Sometimes I won’t disconnect, leaving me with dinner prep hands trying to get the squealing feedback to end. This feature is worthless.\n\nNote- returning device. Issues have gotten more prevalent. We watched videos on the amazing screen the first day, but that’s it. We should have gotten the google home hub for the best support and intuitive smart device controls.

Automatically gets dimmer for sleeping, well implemented.\n\n3. Great sound for such a small bedside table device, however, not as good as a high quality soundbar which you can connect too via bluetooth, so echo dot + soundbar actually better.\n\n4. Good video playback, but appears to require a subscription to prime video.\n\n5. Integrates well with Ring devices. This is the reason for my purchase. I tell my device to \"show me the back yard\" (or any other named camera) and it does, with a larger and better, and generally faster view than the Ring app on my cell phone. This is probably reason enough to purchase the item if you use the Ring system and cameras. It appears you can do two way audio from and to the cameras.\n\n6. Nothing from Google (say Youtube) is available directly, however, you can ask alexa to \"open google', at that point you can access your email, youtube, and all other google services via the built in Firefox browser.\nNo other streaming appears available without additional cost.\n\n1. The biggest irritation for me, and one that could be easily fixed (and would probably result in a 5* review if it was fixed):\n\nOn the bottom of the home screen, below the nice nature shot you have posted from your camera, the device insists on showing you every minute or so, something new you can try with your echo show. Try x, y, or z. This is incredibly irritating after awhile, especially, if you are not particularly interested... AND THIS CANNOT BE TURNED OFF according to Amazon support. For a supposedly \"customer centric company\", very bad behavior. Force your customers to watch a commercial on the device they have purchased every minute or so.\n\nThe only way I have found to turn this off is to tell the device to \"turn off the display\". This works until something alerts it and it comes back on again, and the \"try x, y or z\" begins again.\n\nHowever, you can train your self to ignore these messages, and eventually the home screen will time out, showing only a grey background with the time.\n\nThe device does so many things well, or reasonably well, I could not give it less than 4* even with this irritating behavior.\n\nReview update: This thing has grown on me with use. Rating change 4* - > 5*.\n\nSeems to be a very well made quality item. Functions well, particularly with Ring camera system. Can look through any camera by voice command.\n\nPandora music displays album cover, and progress bar. A CD without having to take care of the CD.\n\nFidelity is good, but better if tied to quality sound bar via blutooth.\n\nCan view email by saying \"open google\", then selecting gmail or news or whatever from the google menu. Can respond to email, but difficult to forward to third parties, this needs improvement.\n\nVery pleased with the device... have even trained myself to ignore the small print suggestions on the home screen that cannot be turned off. Occasionally, prompts me to try something interesting.\n\nThank you, Jeff. Nice product."},{"reviewerName":"Rudy","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"wow!","reviewDate":"July 23, 2019","reviewText":"i got a great deal on amazon prime day. this is a gift to me!\n\nit looks good and sounds real good. it was a seamless transition from an echo dot. i moved the dot to my upstairs hallway.

Once an hour, usually at night it will wake up and either say sorry I don't understand or something else without anyone near. We've had to unplug it at night so we won't get woken up.\nSecondly, videos just stop playing and it reverts back to the home screen. This is super annoying when I'm trying out a new recipe or trying to entertain my little one for a minute while I take care of dishes or something else.\nNext, I had synced my ring doorbell and nest cams up with it in the beginning and now it refuses to bring up video from either of them.\nAnd lastly, it is a pain trying to bring up anything because either the wrong thing is opened or it'll constantly say \"Sorry I don't understand\" or \"I didn't hear that.\"\nTo be sure that it's the device and not software, I had checked for updates, restored to factory defaults, and even unplugged the thing for hours hoping that any of those would fix it.

You read that right. You have no option to prevent YOUR screen, on YOUR device, from doing what YOU want it to do.\n\nIt is absolutely, totally inexcusable to not offer the owner of any Alexa smart device with video control over there own screens.

Love it!","reviewDate":"December 21, 2018","reviewText":"I've been curious about these Echo products for a few years but we waited, hoping to let Amazon work out some of the security kinks first. I came across a great cyber Monday sale and so we decided to give it a try. I wanted this one specifically for my kitchen, for recipes and videos. I read up a lot on it in advance, how to speak to it etc. There is a definitely some training on both sides. I approached it with patience as I figured out the right way to ask it do what I wanted. My husband (who normally hates technology) quickly took to it and loved it.\n\nIt has a long way to go yet as far as being a bit more intuitive. There are moments I'm glad it has a screen, when it gets befuddled over \"return to the song\" (or something silly) I can just walk over and tap the screen to get what I want. Sometimes it trips over itself. But, I can have my hands in the oven and baking and ask \"Alexa, set timer for 6 minutes\" (you can set multiple timers with different names - whaaaat?) while I'm watching some random tv show or news, or listening to music. \"Alexa, how many tablespoons are in a half cup\" or \"...set a reminder pick up my prescription\", \"add garlic to my shopping list\" \"what's on my to do list for tomorrow?\" Catch my drift? I really have found it super handy. I also listen to MORE music. I pay for Amazon music subscription but really only listened on my phone at the gym etc. Now on a whim, I find I come home from work and ask \"Alexa, play radiohead\" or something random while I'm taking off my coat, and voila! The quicker/easier access to music makes me utilize the service so much more.\n\nI'm still a bit wary of the security, so I've left some things out. I didn't connect my contact list, as I wouldn't want an accidental call to go out to someone while we're having too many glasses of wine at 11pm. No one needs that. The drop in thing is no-go for me. I locked down as much as I could on that stuff. I like that there is a mute button I can press when I don't want her to listen, but we haven't used that as much as we thought we would. I've used it when talking \"about her\" to someone else on the phone (she kept piping into the conversation with her confusion, LOL. MUTE it Alexa.)\n\nThere's also a ton I still haven't tried. I haven't done any shopping on it. I haven't used it for smart home items. I haven't even used the Skype. And I STILL use it constantly and feel like its been impactful in our home.\n\nAll in all, a few gaps to work around so not nearly seamless, but otherwise, it's truly changed our kitchen experience for the better. So many neat little features. I rated it 5 stars based on how awesome this technology is and how great it is at some of these features. I was tempted to go 4 because it has so much further to go, but that didn't seem fair. It's a new technology. I grew up in a world before cell phones - so when I compare that and consider how far this has all come? 5 stars."},{"reviewerName":"clairenpaulimom","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Still needs A Lot of Work","reviewDate":"November 1, 2019","reviewText":"If you have more than 1 person in your house, this is probably not for you.

If you like following cooking recipes on tv, then this is probably good for the kitchen.\n\nAlexa has all the same problems she has on every other Echo device, most frustratingly she can barely answer questions about what the device can do. Instead she either refers you to a help section that mysteriously isn’t available on the device itself even though it has a screen or she just says something like, “Hm, I don’t know that.” One improvement on Alexa’s shopping skills, particular to this device, is that you can look at the products, though it’s a narrow set."},{"reviewerName":"J.

The sound quality seems very good so far. Not as versatile as the fire I am replacing but the show is much better integrated with Alexa than the fire, which is what I bought it for, more compact too.\nWhy the single star? Amazon stole my WiFi password! When I plugged in my brand new show it connected right up without ever asking for my password and they're is no place in the phone so setup to enter or change it. They either have it stored somewhere on their cloud or it gets the password from one of the other devices on my network. Either way this seriously compromises the security of my network, which I take very seriously. So far as I know this is not mentioned in their privacy policy. So if you use Alexa and every hear that an Amazon database has been violated disconnect all Alexa devices and change your WiFi password, in that order.\nUPDATE: I got a message from technical support that said that, yes, Alexa does store passwords in the cloud but that this can be disabled.

So the ad that Amazon shows saying “Alexa show me a recipe” is FALSE. You can’t manually type in searches either.\n\nPartial capabilities: Searching, some apps let you search. Let’s start with Hulu. You can bring up Hulu but won’t have the option from the home screen to search on Hulu. You’ll have to find the right verbal request that’ll allow you to drag the endless screen for what you want.

Scrolls information if you want and adjusts based on lighting and activity around it (i.e. turns off/dims when dark and not active). Can control quite a few things including lights from the interface and also does a great job with video and other media both with displays and control. Alexa works well in displaying information in usable forms (lists, links, data, video clips, etc). While I can control lighting, I found Google Home hub has a better interface for controlling things; just easier to get to and very easy/quick to turn on and off things in the same room. I have not used any of the video calling etc. but from what I've seen that's pretty solid.\n\nSound: This thing sound great. Full sound. Not going to replace any high end systems for music or movies but it's good. I tend to use it for audiobooks when I'm doing work around the house moreso than anything else and it's great for that.\n\nAmazon still hasn't integrated things like Ring into this as well as is should. As a comparison, the Google Home Hub integrates excellent with Nest. Someone ring the nest doorbell and it immediately shows the camera, it very quick with accessing other cameras or the thermostat.

The screen display is also much better. The sound quality is also great. I'm glad I decided to purchase the newest version.\n\nAfter reading some online reviews, I decided to update mine. First, this isn't my first device. We have one in every room (echo, dot, show - 1st gen, & spot). Second, the more you use it, the better the experience and the better it is for Alexa to understand what you want. Third, once I figured out how to set up groups and connect all devices, the experience increased significantly. I can play music in any combination of rooms in my home from my cell phone app. It's been entertaining randomly starting funny songs on the bathroom dot when my unsuspecting husband is hanging out in there too long! Fourth, I work from my home office and have my spot on the office desk. Once I synced my calendar, it was a game changer! I can see upcoming meetings from anywhere I have a screen or just ask the non-screen devices what's on my schedule. I LOVE this feature!\n\nFinally, having 3 adult children, I bought all of them a 1st gen show, now we can do video calls to each other from different sides of the country at any time since this works both on the screen device and on your cell phone.

This thing should be able to do everything the fire tv can... you cant even shop on amazon with it normally. you get some weirdly watered down version of everything.

I put the old show in the kitchen, where, it turns out, everyone in the household uses it!\n\nThis new show is on a table that sits along the side of my bed. The angle is perfect for lying on my side to watch you tube videos or prime videos when i go to bed. The screen size is excellent for that purpose, and for reading lyrics. The old show screen was hard on my old eyes. The sound is much improved as well.\n\nThe only thing I wish for (and this applies to both generations) is that there were more skills made specifically for the show, and that they were easier to find.

When you ask her to tell you about it, she reads the story but there is no true picture of the object in question. Instead, you get to see a regular banana instead. The name is Echo SHOW. Please show me what you are talking about. The video quality is pretty good when talking to others in different rooms and the recognition of voices is better than other Echo units.

I use that via bluetooth to play audio from a Microsoft Windows Surface device, audio that comes from a special server accessible by a browser like Chrome. The old Echo speaker worked perfectly. I wanted 2 more things, first, a slideshow of my Amazon photos, and second, a self-dimming clock. Both those functions worked splendidly except...\n\nWhen streaming Bluetooth, the Echo Show would frequently just flat out stop working. No audio. Or after about an hour, the audio over the Bluetooth would become fuzzy and distorted and broken. If I turned off the Windows device, the Echo Show still thought it was connected! I had to restart the Show and repair the thing to my Windows device.\n\nWhile playing the audio, it would constantly show me \"Now Playing\", which interrupted the slideshow and clock entirely! No way of turning that off that I could find. And worse the Show would randomly connect and disconnect with the Windows over Bluetooth. USELESS TO ME IN THIS STATE! I wanted the better audio from this to play while it just kept displaying my photos and appointments on the home screen, but no, it kept switching over to NOW PLAYING. What an awful thing.\n\nI've been using my Echo Speaker Only for two or more years without problem! I wish this Show would achieve the level of connectivity and reliability. I now have my old Echo Speaker, with the microphone muted, sitting next to the show so I can play my audio AND display my photos and appointments and clock continuously.\n\nIt's unacceptable to have two of these things next to each other! Worse yet, if you have multiple Echo devices within earshot of each other, and I mean one or two rooms away, when you say Alexa, they all wake up and dogpile each other and it's a crapshoot which device will actually process your command, like \"Alexa, what time is it\".\n\nThey should allow you to set ANY WORD as a WAKE WORD so that you can address each one separately and uniquely. Furthermore, when one device (wake word Alexa) announces that you have an AMAZON shipment, another device nearby with the wake word of AMAZON will wake up and almost attempt to reorder the item.\n\nThis smart speaker world is fraught with frustrating pitfalls especially when one of them THINKS it hears it's name, or an Amazon Alexa advertisement is playing on the TV and they all wake up stupidly.\n\nPLEASE FIX THIS.

And boy, I could not send that Google Hub back to where it came from fast enough! It may be great for smart home only users, but it is no fun or really that useful, other than that, at all! You cannot even get answers or videos that come even close to what Google gives you on your cell phone!! And, it is not for the sight impaired- meaning me. If I needed to know the time after 6pm, I asked Alexa. I don't get it...\nAnd, oh yeah baby! I love lyric mode on this thing! This bad boy can rock your booty off, for sure! The bass vibrates everything on my kitchen counter! I love it!!\nI call mine Alexxx sometimes... it answers, most of the time, no matter which name- Alexa or Alexxx. I do wish it had a man's voice, sometimes.... really could use hearing one once in a while! It's kinda funny, sometimes, I just get ignored- similar to a man lol. Like, when I asked her to repeat the same song for the tenth time. Or, she will just decide that I need to listen to a certain playlist, instead of said song. It's annoying, but sometimes the first song is so good, it gets me to listen. Still... If I say play this song, and she says, I'll play \"this\" instead, it's rude!\nAnother thing I absolutely love, is watching YouTube. I've saved my Channel to the homepage in the Silk Browser, so all I have to do is just tell it to open YouTube. It goes straight to my homepage. I can go to or watch my subscription feed and playlists, go to my watched history, watch recommended videos, and easily search for anything I would like to watch. It is so quick and easy to navigate! My most favorite thing to watch, is Criminal trials, and they last for weeks. So, while I'm working in the kitchen doing other things, or just sitting around the table, I can pick up where I left off on my Fire Stick, and watch them right there on my echo.\nI can search the internet for anything! I can type it in, or make it even faster by using my voice and just hitting the enter key on the onscreen keyboard.\nI've heard a lot of people complain that there are too many steps to do things on the Echo. But, I can get to anywhere on mine almost as quickly as I can on my regular computer.\nI hate to say that I haven't ventured out into the many, many things this thing can do, other than these few things, but they're the ones that I enjoy. One day, I'll try venturing out into unchartered territory for myself on this lovely device.\nI know I can tell you one thing is for certain. I will definitely be buying more of these wonderful, booty shaking, singing to the top of my lungs, mind blowing gadgets very soon! I just have to have them in several rooms!

We selected the Echo Show 2 because the reviews said the sound was superior to the comparable Google device and because the built-in camera allowed video conferencing - something we do regularly. While the speakers and picture lived up to our expectations, the quality of Skype calls was poor. And, my wife was never able to get it to connect properly to her calendar.\n\nMost importantly, Alexa did not give correct responses to many simple questions, including follow up questions to the trending topics that were suggested that we ask Alexa. Just 2 examples of many, Alexa suggested we ask about: A rare chimera cardinal, but it was unable to respond correctly when we asked to see pictures. And, Usain Bolt beating the NFL 40-yard dash record, but it could not respond correctly when we asked what was the record time. Also, it was unable to respond correctly on multiple occasions when we wanted to see recipes for specific foods.\n\nEvery day we experienced numerous instances where Alexa could not provide an answer, but we were able to get the correct answer from the Google Assistant. (The requests for pictures was done with our smart phones but others were done with the Google Mini.) The inability to respond and/or the incorrect responses from the onset caused us to start testing and comparing Alexa versus the Google Assistant right away. After a week, we had enough and concluded that Alexa was unable to meet our needs.\n\nBecause of our extreme frustration with getting accurate information, we never bothered to connect Alexa to the other smart devices in our home, so we cannot say how Alexa might have handled tasks like turning lights on and off. And, I was not satisfied with the limited selection offered to shopping inquiries versus the selection offered when looking at Amazon on my computer.\n\nWhile the reviews indicated that Alexa is compatible with more 3rd party devices, they also said that Google had the edge to answering informational inquiries. We just never imagined that the discrepancy would be so great. If getting answers to questions regarding news, sports or 'how to' are important, we suggest you go with the Google Assistant.\n\nThe final irony came as I prepared to return the product. Alexa was unable to respond to the question of how to reset the device to the factory defaults, but Google was able to give me the answer."},{"reviewerName":"The Shopinator","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"AMZ is getting much closer with the Gen2 Show, a good upgrade!","reviewDate":"May 16, 2019","reviewText":"THIS is the product that SHOULD have been the Gen1 release and every feature (of the guts) was available and affordable to make, so I wanted to get that criticism out of the way straight up.\n\nNow the goods and bads, mixed by feature.\n\nCome for the sound? Stay for the display.\nThe reality is that this is NOT HD, but ED, 720p for video playback. HD is 1080p for video playback. If UHD can be built into cellphones, not even phablets, then the raw displays and drivers are clearly MUCH cheaper as they increase in size. Still, this is a much better, approximately twice as large display than the Gen1 Show's display, though it doesn't seem to be any brighter, something I've seen lab-tested to be so. Since this is not OLED, it's not going to do better in your sun-drenched kitchen than the Gen1 did, even if it is clearer and larger so you can see it more easily on the other side of your island.\n\nBut what really disappointed people most in the Gen1 Show was the sound. Not that it was bad... it just wasn't good. I have $30 portable radios that blow it away. The recently upgraded software for Spot/Show helps GREATLY by finally providing individual bass/mid/treble controls which most people will set wrong. And while the bass and \"whomp\" is MUCH better from the new Gen2 Show, it's typical big passive radiator v tiny active driver sound. Flabby and prone to splat, even at moderate volume (maybe halfway up with a good sounding recording like stuff from GRP). So, sure, it's able to play louder and it has more bass but it's not quality bass. If there was enough room for a huge passive radiator and the cavity(s) needed to make it function properly, there was room for an active bass driver with a smaller passive so it would be in much better control using a folded audio waveguide, if needed, perhaps even as a replacement for the passive. Most people can't hear that this isn't quite there but people who are accustomed to real audio, my career background serving audiophiles for decades, know better than to go for passives. But they're cheap, so I get it. Lots of bang for the buck... or whomp for the buck.\n\nAt lower volumes, though, it works and sitting on my desk in front of my second monitor, it couples will with the desk surface for bass I feel in my hands. I will experiment to see if this is a good thing or if decoupling is smarter. Also, this new larger Gen2 Show is actually SHORTER than the Gen1, so it is easier to put on a desk with other media equipment and still see behind it, key for me, even if it is much wider and deeper.\n\nPlease continue reading in my replies since AMZ doesn't like long reviews even when they are very detailed and warranted..."},{"reviewerName":"CJ","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Expectations High - Dissappointed!","reviewDate":"June 4, 2019","reviewText":"But the Show failed in just about every way.

One of the things I do not like at all, is the amount of bass. I’ve turned the base all the way off and it still vibrates terribly. Enough that I almost want to take it back. As far as voice recognition, I often have to repeat things two or three times before it understands me. That can be very frustrating. At times it doesn’t hear me at all, and other times it gets the entire thing wrong. You just never know. But that’s no different than the generation one.

It makes cooking and cleaning more enjoyable and upbeat.\n\nIf music really isn't your thing, you should be impressed with the recipe finder and follower feature (I'm sure there is a legit name for this feature but \"Recipe Finder and Follower\" just rolls off the tongue so I'm sticking with it). The Echo Show pulls recipes from various websites, and doesn't just force you to follow some site that has paid extra fees to be featured. If you select your recipe, Alexa will even read it to you step by step.\n\nMy 11 year old loves the Echo Show because he can easily find videos he wants to share with me by simply saying \"Alexa, find me a video of Ariana Grande doing impressions of other singers\", etc.....and then selecting the right video. The device has also solved petty arguments such as \"does green colored mucus mean you have an infection?\". My 14 year old loves it because he can ask those hard to answer questions like \"How much am I worth on the Black Market?\" or \"Why is my mom so bossy?\".\n\nThe multitude of ways this device can make your life easier is amazing. The only con I have noticed so far is that sometimes I have to say \"Alexa\" repeatedly when it is playing music. That's more of an annoyance than a real problem unless you are listening to some raunchy rap or Bill Burr when your child walks in."},{"reviewerName":"Joel Steele","rating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Obnoxious, Infuriating, Antiquated","reviewDate":"January 29, 2019","reviewText":"This device is by far the worst addition to the Echo family so far. The idea of a screen to communicate is shrouded with incessant messages, haptic feedback, miserable intelligence and overall inconvenience. You will be much better off buying a cheap iPad and using the Echo Dot so you can at least move it.\n\nIdeas to improve for the next generation:\n-IMPROVE THE TOUCH SCREEN\nThe screen is so unresponsive, I'd love to give up on it entirely. I have to press \"buttons\" on the screen five or more times for it to register. While I'd love to alleviate these woes with voice commands, the device is severely impaired and has selective hearing. Often times my commands won't even have a single understood word. As much as I'd like to tell my Echo Show to \"stop giving me command options,\" it won't \"know that.\"\n-Display options\nIf I have to see one more \"Try, Alexa, tell me something weird\" prompt, I might throw up. You're a passive device, not my reluctant friend with ADD.\n-Improved syncing:\nWhile your speakers are marginally better than previous Echo devices, the connection between devices to have multi room music is awful.

I love my Echo devices and use them all the time. I figured this one would be a fine addition to my collection. By and large, it is, but there are a few things that led to the 3-star rating, which I will explain below.\n\nFirst, sound quality and voice recognition on this thing are superb. Video quality is quite good too, though from my own eyes I would say most top end tablets have this thing beat handidly. This thing will hear you from wherever you are in your house, and you will hear it.\n\nNow, the reason I didn't give it 5-stars is this: I don't see how truly more useful this thing is over my other Echo devices. Its limited functionality as a screen device is what brings it down for me. There is very, very limited \"app\" support (and good lulck trying to side-load anything). You're at the whim of the Amazon catalog, which basically limits your video options to Amazon Prime and Twitch - both of which are fabulously entertaining platforms, but still very limiting.\n\nThis device flourishes in a kitchen setting where you can view recipes and watch on-screen instructions, but the options there seem quite limited and not as versatile as just having a good cookbook by your side. Its a great device for music, but so are the other Echo devices. The option for on-screen lyrics is neat, but also useless in the grand scheme of things.\n\nBy and large, what makes this device great is also what makes it hard to review: its really meant for the kitchen. I tried it as a bedside table device, and it didn't really ad anything. Tried it as a living room device, but for what purpose? In the kitchen? That's where its meant to be. And that, combined with what I mentioned above, is its limiting factor."},{"reviewerName":"MichaelJ","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"It's nice but it's sloooowww","reviewDate":"August 17, 2019","reviewText":"We have several Alexa speakers and this is our first show. Overall we like the concept, and the sound quality is good but there are a few things about it that are frustrating. I don't know how anyone can give this thing 5 stars though, primarily for the main reason below that it's slow.\n\nSo about slow. I don't know how Amazon could ship this honestly in the state it's in. Drop in calls sometimes work fine and other times time out or take forever to connect. Same with skills. The Jeopardy skill regularly crashes back to the main screen and videos are slow to respond or become unresponsive for many 10s of seconds requiring me to manually cancel it or on rare occasion reboot the device. Honestly in this area it needs polish. I'd send it back if a replacement speaker wasn't the same price (I got it on a sale at a substantial discount).\n\nAs others have noted as well it would be nice to have some more flexibility around what you want to see and how the screen acts. As is its 'on rails' and Alexa seems to show whatever Amazon wants to show you and not based on any preference or interests you set. So that's a missed opportunity too.\n\nIt does work okay with our Ring doorbell which is one of the reasons I bought it.

For $400 I could get an iPad Mini and do 1000X more than this will do. Not very customizable visually at all. I can change the background and turn a few home screen options on or off. Trending Topics is totally irrelevant to me. I searched for ways to replace it with trending news stories from news sources that I like. So far there is no way to do this, even though this would be a very simple feature to add and would be much more useful than the trending topics. Finding good skills (i.e. apps) is difficult. For every 5 star skill available, there are fifty 1 star skills you have to look through. I do like the suggestions that cycle at the bottom of the screen. Try “Alexa ...”. This is actually useful along with the email they send you once a week with the same kind of tips. Overall, the UI is extremely basic and boring though. At this rate, you should wait for maybe the 5th generation if they are even still making these that long. The 2nd generation is unimpressive and I honestly feel like I wasted my money.

It is an all or nothing thing in my opinion. Our household is fully engulfed by Amazon. My 1 yr old's first word was \"Alexa\"!\n\nI got the Show during Prime Day. As with all technology, in order to keep up with smooth functionality, devices need to be upgraded. The Show is definitely more responsive than my 1st gen Echo.\n\nPros:\nSound - for a multifunctional product, the sound the Show produces is quite impressive.\nResponsiveness - Voice recognition is so sensitive that it sometimes picks up my voice from across the house\n\nCons:\nInterface - Some will argue it just is not meant for this type of UI. I feel it would definitely benefit from having more tablet like functionality. There is nothing worse than repeating yourself 5 times to no avail. As mentioned in some other reviews, trying to watch movies on the Show is complicated to say the least.\nIntegration - Alexa just isn't able to do everything the Show wants it to be able to do. I would love for everything to be hands-free, but only if it serves its purpose. Alexa responds quickly, but not always accurately.\n\nOverall, it is great device. Especially if you can get it for under $150. I got the Show to provide easier access to my Ring Cams (another amazon product), and video chat with older relatives.

I had no sound, but when I unplugged the cord in back of the Show, waited a bit, and replaced it, the sound returned. If I do not unplug the device from the base before unplugging from the wall first when moving the show elsewhere, the sound disappears when I plug it back into the wall outlet.

It is hefty and build quality is solid. The 1st gen sitting next to it is dwarfed in comparison. It was easy to set up, just like the 1st gen. I'm hoping it doesn't develop the same annoying popping sounds that my 1st gen suffered from because it looks great on my desk and works seamlessly with my apps. I was a little disappointed in the sound quality, however. Due to the fact that they moved the speakers to the sides instead of having them fire forward, it becomes necessary to pay more attention to where the unit is placed (i.e., you have to pay attention to objects around it and how that impacts the sound deflection.) I realize this was a design choice in order to maximize the screen, so that's the trade off. This is my fifth Echo device. Each style (Dot, Tap, Show, etc.) has its place. Keep in mind, the 10 inch diagonal screen is contained in an 11 and one half inch frame. Take out a tape measure and be sure you have a place for something this big. As I live with my Echos, I find them to be more than just gimmicks or entertainment devices. Rather, they have become great tools to help with productivity in the office, garage, kitchen, and theater.

With that positive impression, I purchased a second Show, the 10.1\" second generation unit for my kitchen. What a disappointment, the Show 5 is an obviously more capable device. The first disappointment came when I found out you can NOT control the display time out. I want the Echo to display photos when on the home screen. Instead, the display shuts itself off (except showing the time) after a couple of minutes, and there is no setting to control or disable it going to sleep. It even goes to sleep when you are in the middle of watching the x-ray lyrics of a song being played. Secondly, it has no Alexa app skills to display documents or saved HTML. I want to display MY recipes that I have painstakingly accumulated over the years. I can save them as almost any format (.XLS, .DOC, .TXT, .PDF, or HTML, etc.), but the Echo Show is NOT capable of displaying ANY format. All it can do is display Alexa generated web images when you ask for a recipe. So much potential, but so limited, and so poorly implemented. My only hope is that they will improve the software over time. With Amazon's vast resources, improvements like these should be a 'no brainer'. Right now, its not even capable of being a decent electronic picture frame.\n\nUpdate 8/5/2019\nI can hardly believe it, but Amazon contacted me regarding this review, and we were able to talk through the display timeout issue. The rep agreed to submit my concerns to the development team regarding the display issue as well as my suggestions for future enhancements. Way to go Amazon for actually listening! I don't know if it was already in the works or not, but my Show 10.1\" is now displaying Amazon Photos correctly, without the display going to sleep. The display still goes to sleep when showing background photos, but I have hope that will be corrected eventually. As for future enhancements, like being able to display MY recipes (instead of just random website recipes) I guess we'll have to just wait and see. I've decided to keep my Show, because it IS getting better, and Amazon actually listens.

This is important because while it's not hard to pull out your phone to check on your ring feed, having the show is faster to pull up your ring feed and why not view it on the big pretty show screen? The show can also control your whole smart home if you have more smart devices that you want to use it with. Now on to why I mentioned having the echo dot. While I love our echo Dot and it is not a subpar device in anyway (has awesome voice recognition and Spotify sounds very good on it) the sound on the show is so so much better. It puts out every tone and beat in the songs and it can get very loud. Crystal clear quality. However if your wanting to get this for the sole reason of watching your Netflix or HBO I would recommend just getting an HD10 or even an HD8. While it's not impossible to watch these services on the show, there's a few extra steps you have to go through. If your watching solely prime video stuff it's flawless. Just get both if you can afford it!

I had often used an iPad for looking at recipes. This just blows that concept away. Having the visual to along with things you already use everyday with Alexa is one of the best ideas Amazon has come up with. I love being able to see the lyrics for songs as they play. I love being able to watch my favorite movies and Prime originals from my Prime account while I'm cooking dinner. I love being able to see the weather forecast with icons and multi-day outlooks. I love being able to pull up recipes using \"The Sous Chef\" app. I love seeing everything that is on my shopping list as I create and add new items.\n\nWe have so many different Alexa enabled devices in our house and I can control everything from this amazing little hub. The screen allows me to dim lights I have in different zones in the house. I can check our baby's room with our Wyze camera. I can drop in on other rooms to communicate with the rest of the family when they are in a different section of the house instead of having to yell \"dinner's ready!\" at the top of my lungs. The sound quality is superb compared the generation 1 echo and echo dot devices. The picture quality is stunning for such a compact device. I watched one of \"The Hobbit\" movies the other day while cooking and I could not get over how crisp the picture and sound were.\n\nSome things are not fully integrated yet, which is why I did not give it 5 stars. I have Kuna lights and I was hoping to be able to see my Kuna cameras at each door, but this hasn't happened yet. Also, there is no way to set a screen time out on it yet. You can turn off the screen by saying \"Alexa, turn off screen\" but otherwise it stays on for quite sometime before shutting down. Also, with the screen time out, if you are in a web browser, like Silk, watching something streaming online, it will go back to the home screen after a few minutes. This is frustrating if you are watching youtube videos or streaming content from Netflix or something like that.\n\nOverall, I love this device. It has taken the great Alexa-enabled home we already have and enhanced it to juggernaut status.

I didn't care very much for the design of the product, the looks, and the screen size/quality. When Amazon offered deep discounts on the new Echo Show if you traded-in your 1st gen Show, I decided to take the plunge. We mostly use our Echo's for listening to Amazon Music, and for the price the Echo's, including the Show, performed well. Gen 1 of the Show had good but not great sound. The screen was good but not great. Gen 2 addresses both of these issues and as a result, the product feels and looks like what the Show should have been all along.\n\nThis biggest and best part of the gen 2 Show is the screen. The screen is basically the whole front of the device and it looks really good. Out of the box I had to adjust the brightness as the default setting was too low. Everything on the gen 2 screen looks good. From song lyrics to 5 day weather forecast, the screen is bright, clear, and with good resolution. I recently purchased the Amazon Fire Recast device which allows you to stream \"over air\" TV to your Fire devices and to your Echo Show. On the gen 1 Show, watching tv was difficult because of the screen size and quality. With gen 2 Show, watching TV is much better. The screen size and clarity fo the screen make watching local news/tv a pleasure. The screen is nice enough that streaming Prime Videos is nice as well.\n\nThe sound on gen 2 is also improved. The sound is louder and fuller. Out of the box the bass is too much and drowned out the rest of the music. The Show has an equalizer setting that allows you to adjust the bass and treble. The gen 1 Show did not come close to the sound regular Echo's can provide so I generally listened to music over the Echo's rather than the Echo Show, unless specifically in the kitchen where my Show is located. Now with gen 2, the sound is good enough that it is not a compromise.\n\nThe big question is, is the gen 2 worth the upgrade from gen 1? Absolutely, especially if you can get it at the discounted prices. At full price it is still a good upgrade but may not be worth it depending on your particular use. For me, listening to music and watching TV improvements would make the full price a generally good value."},{"reviewerName":"Steve Segal","rating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Amazing sound - BUT - Lacks basic touchscreen support and software functionality.","reviewDate":"December 3, 2018","reviewText":"Got 2 on Black Friday. Heres my review and criticisms of this device. Im confused and conflicted about this device. I feel like Amazon knows they need to improve on the software. Pros : Sounds amazing - 11/10. Like seriously, the bass on this thing is wow. It's really clear.\n\nNow onto the cons.. On my phone, I can touch anywhere, and get a response. There needs to be a back button, there needs to be swipe functionality, like from the bottom up on an iPhone. Im touching parts of the UI on the Show expecting it to do something, and Im frustrated that I can/cant click on certain things that are or arent obvious. There needs to be a Device list similiar to how I control my devices via my Android on my phone.\n\nI can say Alexa (show) turn on Philips Hue. I get the Device, it pops up. I even get a brightness bar. But I cant view any of these devices whatsoever in the 30 Internet-of-thing type devices I have connected to the Alexa ecosystem. What. Why? I dont have friends. I dont use this for making calls or video calls. Thats what phones are for. This product should really be relagated or somehow updated via software to include alot of the features lacking.\n\nThe homescreen is extremely limited. There needs to be way more access to font sizes, font types, what shows up on the home screen. I mean come on, Google killed it. There needs to be options for screen \"timeout\". Just take a page from Android 9.0 or whatever.\n\nIf Amazon takes into account these comments seriously - and I think they do, especially with the always learning doomsday robot named Alexa, she'll probably write code just based on reading this comment.\n\nEdit (1 hour later) - Seems Amazon does take these comments seriously. I got a phone call - asking for feedback. Not even an hour after posting this review. I further explained my situation. Interesting. Gave them more feedback on the ecosystem. I think it really comes down to Software. The hardware is great. Few other things mentioned. Im still unsure whether I will be keeping the device. It is cool to note that they do (for obvious reasons, they read the comments) just wasn't expecting a call or anyone to care or read. As busy as they are, and to receive a followup call. Hope my voice recorded feedback helps, Mr. Bezos."},{"reviewerName":"Amazoner","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Version2 better than version1","reviewDate":"May 30, 2019","reviewText":"I have both generation 1 and 2 of Alexa show. I bought the generation2 with hopes of it being better at hearing my voice from across the room. I have not found that to be the case. I have had the new show for about 3 months now and I love the new features with the new one. The screen is much better, as is the sound system. I bought the swivel stand and the screen protector and I am glad I did. Not that anything has happened to it, I have it sitting in my kitchen area and that is always a good idea to have as a safe guard for your Alexa device. Some of the key differences between the devices are the ability with version 2 to have a freetime, where you can restrict activity. Hunches is where you have a connected device that you think or have a \"hunch\" may have been left on too long, you can have Alexa check on it. One real feature I love is the Guard feature. Guard feature detects if your smoke or CO detectors goes off, if there is glass breakage, and can set away lighting. The Guard feature only notifies you if any of these occur it doesn't call authorities, that is left up to your security system. However, I like having the notifications coming to my phone so I can remember to us the drop in feature on Alexa to see what is going on. There are other version2 features but these are the 2 biggest new features that really make buying the new one worth the argument. The Amazon support is great and seem to be really up to speed with any technical issues or questions you have. Overall I love the new version vs the old one."},{"reviewerName":"BeccaM","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Huge improvement over the Echo Show first generation","reviewDate":"July 19, 2019","reviewText":"We have a great many Alexa devices, dating back to the original Echo 'tower' device, but also including the Echo Show original model. We were never terribly impressed with those; it was nice having a touchscreen, but it was too small and while the sound was okay, it was nothing special either. Well, the 2nd generation Echo Show has a screen the size of a tablet and much, much better sound. I had been thinking about buying the Echo subwoofer, but I don't think it's really needed with this Echo Show; the only way to improve it much more would be to pipe the audio to the stereo receiver.\n\nWe also got the adjustable stand for it, which is nice, but honestly it should be a standard included component rather than an add-on accessory.\n\nI deducted a star for the same complaints I had for the first generation Echo Show: Please, Amazon, give us the ability to TURN OFF the \"Try \"Alexa, (some random command\" suggestions. I hate them. Customers have been asking for this option since the day the Show was first released two years ago. And second, give us the means to display the clock (customizable would be best) and/or weather larger on the screen, like with the new Echo Show 5."},{"reviewerName":"LinckG","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"It has potential","reviewDate":"September 26, 2019","reviewText":"I have two of these. They are great for watching the Ring doorbell camera. The sound quality is good. The voice recognition is not as good as my echo or echo dots. Even my Ecobee thermostat pics up the wake word better. It's not bad, It just isn't great like the other devices. It does not interface with the SmartThings camera, which is a major disappointment. It would also be great if it could interface with standard IP cameras, but I doubt that is going to happen. My wife uses one in the kitchen. I have one by the couch in the living room. It is supposed to work with Hulu, but every time I tried to connect it, I had problems. I no longer have Hulu. So, it doesn't matter now. If it had more streaming services like a Roku or a FireTV, I'd get one for the office.\n\nI like being able to send announcements using the onscreen keyboard. The announcement recordings never sound that good. Using Alexa's voice to make announcements is much better.\n\nLyrics for songs is nice. The screen quality is good. The size is right.\n\nBasically, I think this device has potential, but it is not worth the full price.

The sound system, and the display make this device so much more comforting to both look at and use. Voice recognition is fantastic, sometimes maybe a little too good. However, this device has many more flaws than expecting.\nThe first show v2 I had came with a type of \"ghost tap\", where the screen taps without you actually tapping there. Not normally a noticeable problem, but when typing anything or scrolling through a page with hyperlinks, automatically typing in an extra letter or jumping away from the page is extremely annoying. Contacted amazon, and they replaced it. Great customer service. The replacement device started working fine and obviously came in pristine condition. This time, the bluetooth was the one that began malfunctioning. The bluetooth would break connection, which by itself is not a huge problem. However, the echo claimed that my iPhone was still connected when it clearly wasn't. Turning off bluetooth on the phone did nothing. The echo still remained \"connected\" to the phone - when it wasn't. Not a horrible problem, so I tried to manually remove the phone and commence repairing. However, the show refused to disconnect from the phone. It would say \"disconnecting\" yet would never actually disconnect. It was only after a factory reset that the phone was truly disconnected, and the problem was seemingly gone. Paired just fine, music played just fine, yet a few minutes in, the problem happened again, and now, Amazon has gone to try and solve the problem.\n\nAnother complaint I have is the home screen. Mainly, about why the time remains so small. It's got a massive screen, with a lot of just background space, so why not let us, the consumers, customize it more? I'd love to enlarge that time display, and be able to utilize the home screen the way I want it to.\n\nAll in all, with the issues solved, this is a phenomenal device that I'd love to have back in my life."},{"reviewerName":"Traci A Vidal","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Not worth the money.","reviewDate":"August 10, 2019","reviewText":"The Alexa Show is a big pile of poo.

The echo show is just OK. I bought this to replace our original echo and I really don't think it sounds as good. I have played a lot with the equalizer to try and make it sound better but still has a funny bass sound and just doesn't sound like I would like it. It doesn't sound bad just not as clear as I had hoped.\nI was also hoping that it would also do better at picking up voice commands but does about the same as the old unit. The addition of the screen is nice sometimes but not as much as I was thinking. It can also be very distracting for little kids that tend to be drawn to screens. I am always telling the unit to turn off the screen.\nProbably the most annoying thing is the volume control. It would be nice if it could normalize the volume. Different apps YouTube, Amazon music, etc. all play at different volumes. You also can not control the volume of her voice separately from the main volume. So if you have to turn up the volume high to hear a video on YouTube or another app the voice volume is crazy loud. It would be nice to have a system (voice) volume control separate from the main volume. Maybe this will be fixed with an system update or something in the future."},{"reviewerName":"E. Tucker","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"One drawback keeps this from being a 5 star device.","reviewDate":"March 1, 2019","reviewText":"Not going to beat around the bush here, the next version of this device must be able to tilt the camera out of the box. I mean really, this is my only issue. Where it sits, or really anywhere in my house it is always aimed up at the ceiling which means there is typically a light in the background and as anyone that has ever taken a photograph knows when you have a light in the background it will darken the overall image to adjust for exposure. If you look at the second picture I posted you can see how it has a very high angle, capturing more of the ceiling than the rest of the room. This was done so you can stay in frame while talking, however with those lights in the background I or anything I am trying to show someone on the camera come through darker making it difficult to see details unless I move to block the lights with my body or whatever I am holding up. The ability to either tilt the camera or adjust exposure manually would help this issue. Second, we are about to have out first child and my in-laws live about an hour away. They wanted a way to be closer to the family without always having to drive back and forth. So when I purchased this device I also purchased one for them. My initial idea was to put one in the nursery so they could \"drop-in\" on the baby, issue is all they will be able to drop-in on is the ceiling and maybe a top rail of the crib. So unless I am in there holding the echo and showing them the baby or holding the baby in front of the echo it just won't work the way I wanted it to. Which is why it is now in the kitchen.\n\nHopefully Amazon will design this feature in to the next version of the echo show. Until then I think I am going to grab either the tilt stand for the echo show 2nd gen (while it will help, it sucks having to purchase something that could have been built in and I don't know if it will tilt down far enough to accomplish what I want) or I can purchase an Echo Spot and a tilt able wall mount that I can mount above the crib.\n\nEverything else about the Show 2nd gen is amazing. Speakers are great, has very clear audio even at high volumes. Image quality is good. The presence of the device is unobtrusive. Amazing build quality. I love the device. Just wasn't expecting such a high angle on the camera, it may be obvious to some but it took me a bit by surprise once I started to use it."},{"reviewerName":"AJ","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Overall a great,useful device.","reviewDate":"August 9, 2019","reviewText":"I really find I use the Echo devices more than I ever thought I would I have found that lately they have issues with understanding requests. It's not just myself or on one device so I wonder what happened to make it worse rather than better. It's not horrible but definitely annoying! In general the Echo devices are wonderful and the echo Show2 is definitely the best of all of them. I do have a suggestion...I do feel they should make a water resistant and easily cleanable version for those who would like to have an Echo Show in the bathroom or kitchen or even an out door version for people who would like one for thier yard. This is a wonderful item but it will not be good for a kitchen where it could have something splashing on it. Many people don't realize that YOU CAN TURN OFF THE CAMERA AND MIC by just taping the button on top. I also recommend that those who only want to turn off the camera occasionally but keep on the mic ....if you don't want to have to go into settings...to turn the camera off...buy these stick on camera covers with a slide button. It doesn't damage the screen and works great! They are also cheap.

Make no mistake, this is not a high resolution TV for streaming your favorite Prime video channels, nor is it the perfect sounding speaker to stream Amazon music, but it does both of those things quite well.\n\nThere are not many skills that take advantage of the display on this echo device, but I like the simple clock that it is for most of my day.\n\nThe touch screen performs well and the microphone seems to work better than on my echo dots.\n\nIn terms of sound, it gets loud and it sounds pretty good, but it does a weird thing with bass. It's almost like there is a dedicated driver for bass, and that it's coupled with a vibration motor, because if you can feel it, it's deeper, right? I don't know what it is, but it's overemphasized to my ears, giving the impression that it's trying too hard to be a great speaker, instead of settling for just being a really good speaker.\n\nThe mute button is convenient, but I'd have liked to see a shutter for the camera as well. Ultimately, I'd have liked to use this echo device in the bedroom, but not with that camera on it. It shall remain in the 'public' parts of my home.\n\nIn the end, I can recommend the echo show to anyone looking for a smart speaker with a display, but is invested in the Amazon ecosystem.

Deciding between Echo Show and Google Home is tough because most reviewers don’t own either. I finally decided on Echo Show because it controls more things, allows video chats, has a bigger screen, and gives me extras at no cost because of my Prime Membership (like Amazon Music).\n\nBe aware that you need to decide which control convention to go with (Z-wave or Zigbee). I chose Zigbee because the switches and plugs that use Zigbee seemed to be a little cheaper than Z-wave devices. That means Echo’s higher cost can be offset by cheaper accessories. As you add more items, the difference adds up.\n\nWiFi controlled devices will work with either Echo or Google but could begin to slow down your Internet due to traffic jams in your router. Z-wave and Zigbee apparently don’t go through the router.\n\nAlso be aware of the feud between Amazon and Google is kind of like between Sony’s Beta Max VCR and the VHS format. One will win and half of us will be left with outdated technology.\n\nSmart ahome setup is beyond the capabilities of most home owners and you may need the help of a Tech Guru at additional cost. But if you just want to plug it in and surf while you cook, it’s not too hard to do.\n\nBeing able to check who’s at the front door, see when packages arrive, remotely control lights, are all easier for those with limited mobility, but they still need enough tech smarts to be able to make it work.

It freezes, stops in the middle of songs, and has horrible voice recognition. Half the time, Alexa doesn't hear her own name, even if the music isn't too loud. The speaker, to me, sounds more fuzzy and artificial. The glitching is out of control, she talks when we are in the living room far away, she doesn't respond to her own voice, she can't hear you with the music playing. The on screen lyrics don't show, I have to tell her to put them back on constantly, and my screen is always black, never showing the clock or screensaver until I wake her up.

I love that I can \"drop in\" automatically, without them having to get to the phone. It works wonderfully. All I say is \"Alexa, drop in on parents\" and walla! It auto-answers on their end, and the video of their room goes opaque for about 10 seconds (for privacy purposes), and the Echo Show \"announces\" that I am calling them. I can even mute the call (which also turns off my video), and still see/hear them (they can't see me when I'm muted, but they can see a small video image of their room in the top corner of the Show's screen, so they know they're still on video). It sits on my desk, so when I'm in between calls/projects, I \"drop in\" on my parents several times a day. Great for monitoring my parents (and their caregivers, who are pretty darn good).\n\nYou can also make 2-way video calls from the Alexa app on your phone. Not as nice of an experience, but it's nice when you're away from your Echo.\n\nThe only thing I don't like/understand, is why it's mandatory to associate their contact with a phone number (video calls go over the internet, so they don't need a phone number).

My brother had just gotten me an Echo Show so we returned the Google and got them a show instead.\n\nThe Good:\nI will say this integrated much quicker than the Google Home since I'm a Prime User. Setup was extremely simple where as with Google I don't use it much more than for an old email account.\n\nI really enjoy the screen. Calling up a News Flash, weather, shopping list and being able to see it was really nice. Screen is only 720p but honestly at this size you cannot tell.\n\nSound quality is pretty good. We've got an echo dot and you can absolutely tell the difference. We have an open floor plan downstairs and the sound travels well from the kitchen to the living room.\n\nIt works with my Nest products (google owned) with one or two minor issues I'll add in the Cons. But it can control my thermostats and pulls video from my doorbell camera.\n\nHas a built in Smart HUB which is great. Makes pairing other smart devices extremely easy. Usually the echo show can detect automatically which is a plus and if it's another amazon product it's extremely easy.\n\nWorks extremely well with Amazon Music and Spotify.\n\nIt does have a working web browser and can connect to Youtube. It can also call up recipes easily.\n\nShopping list is fantastic and the phone app pairs nicely to it.\n\nBad or Could be Better:\nIt can connect and show video to my Nest Hello camera but no sound. Nest is Google owned so they don't always play nicely together. Not a huge deal though.\n\nMy other Nest complaint was the Nest Skills you must download on the show. I would select the Doorbell and it would take me to the security camera skill. I eventually learned through some message boards to just download the security camera skill and it should recognize it which it eventually did. Just took some time.\n\nOne noticeable difference is Google's AI is better. It understood me far more frequently and did not struggle with questions nearly as much. Alexa isn't bad, it just isn't as good.\n\nSome setting features are in the Show and some are in the app you have to download. I found it a little clunky especially on the show side.\n\nThe whole skills thing so far seems lacking. It looked like a bunch of junk so far or that's at least the recommendations I keep getting. I'm more interested in productive integration...not jeopardy.\n\nVideo calling works. But the recipient has to have a Show or the app downloaded. Just like facetime on Apple, you can't use it on an Android. Most of us seem to have an iPhone so no big deal there, but this is a much smaller market at this point. I've heard skype is coming soon so that should help. I haven't done a Show to Show call yet so I cannot comment.\n\nNot a big fan of how shopping on prime has been setup. It feels super limited so I'll stick to a computer for purchases.\n\nOverall:\nReally like this product. If you're a Prime user it's fantastic for music, video, shipping notifications and delivery. If not it might not be as great but it's still a smart speaker so it doesn't lose too many points. I think they could iron out a few issues regarding software design and making it more intuitive, and they could deff spend a few dollars getting Alexa to Goggle AI levels. I will say I'm still learning to full capabilities of this device so my opinions could greatly improve in the future as I learn more features and add my smart products to my home."},{"reviewerName":"Greg Swensson","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Doesn't play well with Pandora.

And no Netflix. Say you’re listening to music or watching a YouTube video in the web browser or watching Hulu if you ask Alexa to set a timer. It cancels out whatever you were doing just to display the timer. Then you have to go back and restart whatever you were doing before. Also if you’re watching Hulu and you are finished you can’t say “Alexa Stop” or “Alexa stop playing” it doesn’t do anything. You have to say “Alexa go home” which doesn’t feel very intuitive. And it would be nice to have some Audio EQ options don’t get me wrong the sound quality is pretty amazing for the size but I would like to turn down the sub just a little because it vibrates all the knives and plates that are sitting on my counter and creates a negative listening experience. Would also be nice to have quick access to apps and other functions on screen instead of requiring you to use voice commands 100% of the time.

The first show was a big step back in that one aspect.

I can't really filter what news shows up, so I see sports even though sports is a meaningless pastime of a primitive society. You can't tell it to never play a genre of music either, so if it mishears a Metal band name, it will play a rap band... not something a person would do.\n\nIf you're trying to play a song on Unlimited, but only have the regular subscription, sometimes it \"mishears\" it, sometimes it goes to an app that has that song (radio app), and sometimes it will do the ad to upgrade, and that ad is relatively long, every time, and no way to tell it automatically \"no\" until you hear the whole spiel. It's very annoying.\n\nThe translation will censor words, even harmless insults become \"beep\" noises.\n\nThe Audible controls are nice, and the fact you can have music or books stop in any amount of time, or skip X seconds/minutes is awesome. Unfortunately Audible likes to open to your last book by default, so you have to remember the specific command to display all books.\n\nReady apps include sleep noises, but the playlist for Sleep using music, and electronic music, is filled with a bunch of songs with blaring noises and only half of them work, while the other half just wake you up.

You stop asking questions to Alexa, effectively disabling the point of owning the device.\n\nI'm happy with the purchase because I was told the speaker system on this version was the best. It absolutely is. It is room filling, with tons of bass. It's quite amazing, really.\n\nThere's a few things like timers, and lists that work better with a visual display, but it feels like they haven't worked on Alexa's vocabulary or fields of understanding at all. She says she doesn't know to a LOT of things.\n\nHulu, does not work for me. I'm seeing a good mix of people who say it does and some saying it doesn't, but it will not connect to my login. It is also unstable at the login screen.\nThere's a 'screen captcha' anti-bot segment to the login.\nI went through this thing 6 times.. At first it would barely load. It did seem to speed up, and I changed my login just to make sure I had a very simple one for the interface.\nIf you get through the captcha with the correct login and password, it tells you that 'Hulu is not available at this time. Try again later.'\n\nI had a first attempt get stuck on this screen and not allow me to go back into the login section. I reset to factory defaults to get it back.\n\nThis device.. It feels like an early 2000's piece of tech. It doesn't have that apple slick feel to it where everything just works, and obviously they released it slightly unpolished.\n\nI also can't get my nest thermostat to link.\nThere's a huge lack of slickness to the pairing of external devices and services that I find very disappointing. Considering how simplified and scaled down a device this is, what exactly is it if it can't operate external devices particularly well and doesn't do as much as a tablet?\n\nWe also own the 4K firetv cube, and the same problem happens. It wants you to be able to use it hands free, and encourages you to try, but because many of the things it wants you to do don't yet work well, (such as navigation and being stuck in netflix with no way to tell it to navigate towards the title called \"bah blah\", and having her tell you she doesn't know what the hell you mean), you realize immediately that it doesn't work well enough to let you do anything that the very first original echo could do, so, err.. Why does it exist?\n\nFor the cube, you immediately go back to the remote, and for the show, you realize that you just got an original echo with a screen, and you won't be using it for anything else.\n\nFor me, it's a decent bluetooth speaker that gives good weather reports.\n\nI like the speaker.. I like all the original things I liked about the original echo, but the visualization and video apps are currently being wasted.\nThey would have been better off merging a full tablet with alexa, then at least you could navigate to and use hulu, and a web browser, etc etc while they catch up with her abilities.\n\nI'll update my review if they update and fix some problems. I really see a future in this series, but they need to slow it down and get it working better before crossing a platform into visual with a format that can't take advantage of it yet.\nIt causes disappointment and brand wariness.\n\n*update*\nI attempted to login to hulu once again, and it simply worked right away.\nNo idea what the issue was, but there was no delay. Just straight in.\nAlso, I finally got my nest thermostat to pair. If I was of a suspicious mind, I would think it had something to do with my bad review that Amazon then contacted me over :D\nDeals a deal though.

I love them both. Upgrading to the 2nd generation was a no brainer with the larger screen and speaker. However, the Show still has a ways to go before Amazon gets it right.\n\n1. Yes, speaker is larger and more powerful but you lose the intended effect when the speaker points away from you. The actual sound experience for someone standing in front of the Show is a disappointment and actually felt more like a downgrade. Amazon needs to address the directional flow of sound better. The round Echo's are great in terms of projecting sound throughout the room because of it's shape and position of speakers. . . obviously. The Show is too directional and moving sound away from you is not an upgrade in my humble opinion.\n\n2. Tried the video call yesterday and I was shocked. Streaming can be fairly choppy and reminiscent of some of the first web cams that came out onto the market. Low resolution. . . Don't expect to see anywhere close to the same quality streaming as you will get watching something from the Amazon library. Amazon dropped the ball on this one.\n\nI was hoping to pick up additional units as gifts, but at this point, I'll wait until next year to see how Amazon improves upon this year's mode. While I love the larger screen, I would not recommend an upgrade unless you really want the larger screen and don't mind turning the Show around to benefit from the larger speakers.\n\nAnd finally. . . Amazon decided to take a picture of my package at the front door with a link that asks me how I feel about posting a picture online. Seriously? While the picture is only visible in my account, my first thought was that they're trying to move away from any culpability if thieves steal from your house. I have an enclosed patio, out of site from the street. What's to keep a dishonest delivery person from picking up the package after it's been documented online as delivered? Not everyone may feel this way, but it felt like a violation of privacy and an effort which came across a little too aggressive and with no explanation. If Amazon is that concerned, require a signature. I'd rather pick it up at the post office the next day than to have a level of risk which clearly leans against the customer if delivery issues arise."},{"reviewerName":"J. L.

If you're decidedly on team Alexa, this smart display is the one for you. The second generation Echo Show is miles ahead of the original, but many of the first generation device's characteristics remain. Four microphones on the front of the device and four on the top only slightly change the look of the controls. As for better hearing, Alexa heard me the first time with the new Echo Show at distances where I had to repeat the wake word three or four times on the first generation unit, Also The redesign brought much-needed change which makes me a lot more likely to want an Echo Show on display in my own home. the second generation Echo Show sounds much fuller, deeper and just plain better than both its predecessor and the Lenovo Smart Display. That's true for video chatting, online content and music streaming. Yes, a Google Home or HomePod will still win out for room-filling, quality sound. But for a smart display the new Echo Show is no slouch. Speaking of Fire TV, the Echo Show will integrate with Fire TV Recast to put live TV on the Echo Show as a recording .Fire TV Recast is a DVR setup for your smart display.

I was fortunate enough to get into an early adoption queue.\n\nIt's amazing how embedded into my daily life these things have become. I use them for so many things - from morning repeating reminders to get my son his ADD medicine to timers for cooking and my favorite, adding things to my shopping list. I love being able to just ask for a song and have it play.\n\nWeather forecasts, current temp outside, news synopsis... It has become such an integral part of our household.\n\nThe Echo Show was a nice addition, I liked the screen, especially when it came to monitoring multiple timers, or being able to look at lists without having to use the app. But it was a bit small for use across the room, so some things I didn't ask unless I was closer to it.\n\nThis new one removes that restriction. Screen is huge, seeing the two side by side is just amazing. It's bigger than I had expected just from reading the specs and measurements. Screen is vibrant and crisp, text is clear and photos are well displayed.\n\nMy son loves that there are so many genres of jokes he can ask.\n\nI love that the Echo is one of the central parts of my automated home. Switches all over the house, lights, thermostat and video cameras - I love being able to just ask to see a camera and seeing it, or turning lights on and off, or changing the temperature of the house. I was happy before the Echo devices to be able to do all that from the cell phone, but it's even more useful now that the Echo can control so many things. Works well with IFTTT but I still prefer the skills where it can directly access something.\n\nThere just isn't a downside. I'm passing my V1 Echo Show to my mother, who also received my V1 Echo when I upgraded to the newer little cylinder tower for the V2 Echo. And I've given her my old V1 dot when I got the newer dot. It's nice having them in a few places around the house. The dot in my bedroom is my only alarm clock I use anymore, despite having a nice Philips glow light wakeup system... It is just so much easier to say, \"Alexa, set alarm for 6 AM,\" than to hit the buttons on the alarm clock. Especially when you're setting different times for different days.\n\nAnd even for napping sometimes - just tell it what time to sound the alarm, and take a little nap without worrying about napping too long and screwing up your sleep schedule.\n\nWorth every penny for my household, wouldn't be without one anymore..."},{"reviewerName":"Natasha B.","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"No bad but it is missing some features.","reviewDate":"December 12, 2018","reviewText":"We recently received the Echo Show 2 as a gift.

I think not being able to access the kindle books is a huge flaw! If they would allow full access to your Kindle library that would make this product much more useful. Also would be handy to have icons for skills on a home screen because lets be honest some skills require very specific wording that doesn't roll of the tongue naturally.

We’ve had it for three weeks. Our main takeaways:\n- The power of this device is multiplied if you are already an Amazon prime/unlimited user. Even if you are not, I would seriously consider becoming one as a prime membership costs more or less the same than services that give you a similar access to media on other platforms, but also comes with free shipping for amazon items and other perks such as photo backups on amazon photo etc.\n- This device is amazing for music if you have a compatible subscription. Keep in mind that amazon prime already gives you access to many songs. With this device, when I subscribed to amazon music unlimited, an add on, it cost me 3.99/month (although that only gives you access to this service in this device). It can also connect your cell phone to play music you might have downloaded there, and is compatible with Apple Music. Sound quality is leaps and bounds ahead of competitors.\n- We also use it to get our daily news brief. You can select your sources and we play it as we are getting breakfast ready, very useful.\n- Has some other interesting uses, like coordinating shopping lists between multiple users through apps, as well as reminders and alarms.\n- Great for cooking as well with full integration with Allrecipes and other recipe skills.\n- It has some quirky interesting games as well, but this is not a defining feature for me.\n- One area where it lacks compared to some of the competition is trip/drive planning. I have deducted one star for this. There is no embedded map feature that I could find. Others have this. It will however tell you how long it will take you to get somewhere, but in my experience even this is a work in progress with times being shown differing from what my phone shows me.\n- Outisde of news videos, have not had a chance to test the movie feature. I have not seen a Netflix skill, although I have read Hulu is supported (have never tested it myself).\n\nAll in all, don’t regret the purchase at all."},{"reviewerName":"Steven","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"BUYERS BEWARE!!!","reviewDate":"July 26, 2019","reviewText":"Right out of the box it had no audio, had it replaced and it worked.

I figured this would be fixed eventually with updates but it remains as bad today as when I bought it.\nOtherwise, the bigger screen is a big improvement.

The speakers are placed on the side instead of the front to accommodate the larger screen for Gen 2. This seems like a good idea but not having a front facing speaker does not sound good in a large room. If you have the unit close to you on a desk the audio probably sounds descent. I ordered the echo sub for this device which will greatly improve the sound for this echo show Gen 2.\n\nThe main purpose I purchased this Gen 2 Show was for the hub to control smart devices. I have iris by lowes which was my alarm and home automation. Iris by lowes is going out of business March 31st so I got this hub for home automation and I got simpli safe for my alarm.\n\nGen 2 has a bigger screen, better graphics and probably a better device. In my opinion the upgrade is not needed unless you need a hub. The Gen 1 plays just as good and has better sound quality in my opinion because of the front firing speakers. Gen 2 has better quality speakers but because of the side speaker placement the audio seems distant.\n\nI still am a fan of the Amazon ecosystem and they are constantly improving their products. Amazon needs an echo watch. I am not sure what they are waiting on."},{"reviewerName":"Rocky Mount Eddie","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"The Future Is Upon Us","reviewDate":"December 2, 2018","reviewText":"I received the 2nd generation Show along with two 3rd generation Dots (which I paired for stereo) and immediately set up the Show. It was easy, and in a matter of minutes I was up and running.\n\nI began familiarizing myself with its nuances. It wasn't much of a learning curve, as I own the Spot, so... I must say I was impressed with the screen resolution and size. Bright, easily readable from across the room. I love the color details when viewing Youtube videos, as it was faithfully reproduced.\n\nMusic was loud, and some good bass was present. It was easily navigable via the touch screen, or voice commands. And the browsers, Firefox and Silk, launch on command. Cool. Say, 'launch Youtube', and you're there. Sign in to you YT account, and play all videos in your History; or simply tap the address bar, and when the keyboard appears, type in what you want to see. It isn't a seamless way to go about it, but at least it works.\n\nAll-in-all, the Show really delivers on Amazon's stated features and capabilities. I am happy with the Show, and if you aren't very picky, you may be too. Let's begin...\n\nShould you consider purchasing the 2nd gen. Echo Show? If you like your music sounding great; if you like watching videos on an immersive 10\" screen; if you want to browse the internet as you would on a large tablet; watch Vevo or Youtube--yes, you should consider the Echo Show over its competitors. The 2nd generation Echo Show is vastly improved over the 1st generation Echo Show, which looked boxy, and had only seven inches of real screen real estate. Sound on that one was, at best, acceptable. Nothing to dance about, though.\n\nBut on the newer incarnation the sound quality is quite good--no, damn good! You'll get powerful stereo sound. Bass punches solidly, so that you can actually feel it. Highs and mids takes care of rounding out the music quite well, and in stereo. Amazon improved the speaker system so, that you'll wonder how it could sound so good from a smallish footprint. But it does! And this thing can get quite loud. It filled our rather large bedroom without distortion, even nearly way up. Put it in a large living and your next party will be complete with D.J. Alexa on hand.\n\nGetting around on the internet with either the Silk browser or Firefox was as easy as saying, \"Alexa, open...\", and you're taken to the browser where you key-in what site you wish to visit. Sure, the on-screen keyboard is a bit clunky, but you get used to it.\n\nI've not tested the video-calling feature, or the drop-in feature, but from the rave reviews on Amazon about this, it's a winner. Skype will soon be coming to the Show.\n\nI was impressed by the screen quality and accurate color reproduction, even from across the room. Most aren't going to want to sit through an entire two-hour movie, though, but you could if you wanted to. A greater majority relegate the Show to kitchen duty, where it shines. Still, any room (not the bathroom!) is a good place for the Show.\n\nSo, in my opinion, yes you should consider bringing home the Show instead of the competition's products, as Amazon got it right the second time around. And at $230, I'd say it is priced just right to go.\n\nWell, I'll play with this gadget a few days more. In the meantime, The Echo Show must go on!"},{"reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"So far I like the little echo spot better","reviewDate":"March 3, 2019","reviewText":"So far disappointed with the show the little echo spot is better the show goes into sleep mode and the clock is almost impossible to see and it doesnt auto wake up when you are in front of it you have to talk to it for the screen to light up!\nyou get constant alexa tips non stop usually about things we would never be interested in i have all alexa devices types and this one i like the least, it doesnt understand much and you cant shop for stuff on it it cant even find my recent music purchases or tell you whats being delivered that day just your last 4 orders the notifications are always things you already know or an hour after things have already happened.

It sticks straight out so you can't have it up against the wall on the kitchen counter without bending the wire, and I am afraid it will eventually damage it. So it sits out a few inches taking up more counter space. The second, bigger issue, is the one with the sound cutting off and having to be unplugged to reboot to get the sound back. This is a KNOWN issue and I really wish they would come up with an update to fix it. I don't know what sets it off so it's not like I can just \"not\" do whatever it is. It would be really nice if this had an easier to access web browser so I could get to recipes easily. I still end up using my tablet propped against the wall for that. The sound is great but it would be nice if it were a little more customizable as the bass is a little too heavy. The screen is a nice size, it integrated well with my other home automation such as lights and outlets.

Has a large, vibrant display, and arguably the best sound of any of my Echo devices. I cannot compare it to either \"Plus\" - don't have either one of those, but can compare it to every other one and this Show produces a rather decent thump with the bass and the treble carries well. The passive sub adds more to the depth of sound than one might expect.\n\nOne complaint, and this is common to both this new Show and the original. When you get a notification or a message on most other Alexa devices, you get a yellow ring on top that pulses to let you know at a glance that you've got one or more of them waiting for you. Nope, nothing on this screen unless you happen to touch it and see the banner that says \"new message for...\" or whatever. Would be really nice to be able to see at just a glance from across the room if you've got a message or notification. I'm sure they could fix this with a software update, but I guess not enough people have complained about this for them to address the issue.

Sure, you might be able to \"connect\" the devices on the app screen, but whether they will integrate correctly to function the way you wish often runs hit or miss, and attempting to find answers to questions leads nowhere more than not. Operating the devices separately usually presents no problem, especially with simple requests. But put two devices in proximity, and you're liable to find some confusion on Alexa's part. When I ask Alexa to play music on my music group, I get a completely different response, though that is the phrase suggested for playing music on all of my Alexa connected devices. So, what really is the problem: is the app not in a state of complete functionality yet? Does Alexa not \"hear\" my voice correctly? I don't know, and I can't find answers to my questions on the help sites. For now, I can listen to music, if I carefully make a simple request, and receive answers to basic questions, \"What's the weather forecast?\", but beyond that the functionality of the devices is limited . . ."},{"reviewerName":"Dan W","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"product doesn't work","reviewDate":"July 18, 2019","reviewText":"I received brand new Echo Show 2nd generation.

I called technical support and they were unable to solve the problem.

The idea of having a Smart Screen with voice recognition is great. But here is the thing it is super limited. Though Echo has a touch screen you can't actually touch and scroll through everything. I have many videos on Prime but I can only access my last 25 purchases or so. Hulu is available, but it won't allow you to switch accounts if there are multiple users. Also you can't pick which episode you want to watch on it, it automatically starts with the first or last viewed episode. For the cost of it I was expecting to have more features and to be able to do more. I can't pull up recipes I have on Pinterest or other sites only the ones Alexa suggests. All in all unless you have the ring doorbell and a family member with another you want to \"face time\" with this isn't the best bang for your buck.

While some may find the different pop ups annoying, we enjoy them. I can see where some would like a way to turn them off, but our house enjoys seeing and frequently clicks on the snippets. The pip ups also help us to learn new skills a available with Alexa. We frequently use this with our Premium Prime music and the family enjoys seeing the lyrics. It’s nice to also view particular items on Prime we are interested in buying.

Frankly, it's not very useful. It shows topics you can learn more about (which to my knowledge cannot be customized to be what I’m actually interested in knowing), but you have to enunciate very clearly for it to pick up on what you are saying, even though it’s a suggestion from the Echo. Then the information is frequently inane and not worth the effort. I’ve also searched recipes on it, and it does give multiple suggestions and allows you to add ingredients to a shopping list. But when cooking from the recipe, the ingredients are on one page, and the instructions are on another, so you have to toggle between screens to see how much is to be added at each step. I does play music well, and listens to commands such as to operate the connected Wi-Fi plugs I have throughout the house. But for general information questions, it’s poor at best.\n\nFrankly, I wonder if I’d like Google for the home better for information. I frequently ask Alexa something, get a wrong, off topic answer (or hmm, I don’t know that), and go to my phone and ask Google and get what I’m looking for.

No one else remembers any of their language training and it makes it tough to keep current. Just a thought for improvement for future updates. Please.

I buy a lot of stuff, including most of the Alexa items over the last few years.\n\nHowever, the Show 2nd generation apparently has some problems. I've had two of them fail within a month of purchase, more or less, and both had no audio. I reset them, no fix. The manual volume buttons would show the volume bar on the screen moving, but no sound. Two separate devices, same exact problem.\n\nBut my bitch is that if more than 30 days have expired, I can't just click and get a return label. I have to \"chat\" with someone who tells me to reset.

I don't have extra time to wait for replies from whose tech support is based upon reading menus.)\n\nI've been buying electronics for three decades at least, and i don't need to be told to reset. Further, if the device needs periodic resetting, well, it is broken. I don't reset my toaster, my microwave, my car, or my airplane. Why should I have to continually reset a $300 device on my kitchen counter?\n\nAmazon should send me a new one, instantly, and let me use the new box to the ship one back. I don't save boxes: I buy way too much stuff to build a warehouse to hold Amazon boxes. So sending it back first (in the wrong packaging, but all that I have, and a hassle at that), then waiting a week or two, just to \"fix\" a device that shouldn't have failed in the first place, especially when I suspect strongly that audio failure is a \"known issue\", just pisses me off.\n\nWhen it fails in the first six months, not thirty days, send me a new one.

This is a surprise gift for his Christmas. The show was packaged great, it felt like I was opening a new iPhone. The setup couldn't have been simpler, as I don't really like the Alexa app. Everything was done on the screen and there was no need for the app. I did mess up the setup by mistyping my phone number and that led me to call Amazon but they were able to fix that quickly. I was quite impressed with the overall build quality, the speakers were loud and it has decent bass. Also, the screen brightness automatically adjusts to fit surroundings, so when I wake up I am not blinded. I purchased this with the Wyze Cam $5 addon, and I will leave a review there for that. But the ability to pull up cameras (this is my first show) and see them it fantastic.

But couldn't pass it up during Amazon Prime Day!! Anyhow it took me a week or so to install do to work schedule but after setting up I could have done it in less than 10 mins.\n\nPros:\n1. I really love the on screen display. It alternates with weather info, news articles and makes suggestions on current events you can watch.\n2. If you are not into that you can setup for it to show you photos from your amazon account.\n3. If you own a Ring door bell, another cool feature is that you can ask it to show you camera \"xyz.\" This feature comes in handy if you need to see an alert you got at your front door. Yes guys if you set it up as a routine you can have your Alexa say \" someone is at the front door. \"\n4. Each time you trigger her name \"Alexa, Computer, Echo\" you hear a nice tone that lets you know she is listening. This comes in handy if you are not facing the unit. Other wise if you are able to see the unit you see the typical blue lights as a bar across the bottom of the screen.\n5. When playing music from Amazon Music, the echo show, displays you lyrics which for the kids is a lot of fun. For adults who thought the lyrics were something else you are in for a learning treat as you sing along to the correct lyrics.\n6. You can integrate multi room speaker setup so that you can play music simultaneously throughout all your alexa devices.\n7. The sound quality on my echo gen 1 was pretty nice. The sound quality on the echo show 2nd gen is AMAZING!\n8. I went with this model because it has a lovely 10.1 screen, big enough that you can see pretty well across the kitchen as you prep your ingredients from a recipe.\n9. I don't watch movies yet on the device but I do watch videos\n10. I don't make video calls yet but I do send messages to friends and when they respond back you can see an icon letting you know you have a message.\n11. The echo show 2nd gen is terrific about showing you your events. For some reason echo gen 1 when I would ask for my events for the day it would tell me I didn't have any. Perhaps operator error. This unit shows me everyday what my events will be!!!\n12. When you ask it to do something you get to see that it is turning on lights and at what percent those lights are on. You can either manually change the percentage or you can ask her to change the percentage. Just really cool that you can see it being done in front of your eyes.\n\nCons:\n1. Not a big deal but the echo show 2nd gen seems to take a few seconds longer when I ask it to do something.\n\nOverall I am very satisfied with my purchase, the family loves using the unit more than before, and I would highly recommend this product to friends and family. I can’t wait to see how they continue to improve on this device."},{"reviewerName":"Orcatrainer","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"French is a go !","reviewDate":"July 2, 2019","reviewText":"I bought this one for my mother during mother's day promotion. Since she only speaks French, I wanted to be sure it has French language capability, otherwise no point to get it.\n\nAfter some research on line I found out that there is a way to enable French (from France or Canada) on it, when creating a new Amazon account then select French at setup. Then I set up everything in French on it, and gave it to my mother. The power plug that comes with it supports 10v to 240v, so it's totally compatible with the French power as well.\n\nOtherwise, the unit works flawlessly so far, without any troubles with the camera or sound. The only minor issue we have with it, is that no matter the language spoken, the Echo seems to have troubles to get the voice command said to it right away, and we will end up having to repeat ourselves from time to time.\n\nI will update this review later after to see how this device does after few month of use.

The only bad thing is that you can't load a Netfl;ix app, they do not have one that works with the Show. So while Amazon advertises watching video on the Show, what they really mean is that you can watch Amazon video, and only Amazon Video. You can't watch NetFlix because they did not make an NetFlix app for the show, and Google owns Youtube, and since Amazon won't sell Google devices, Google won't let Amazon have access to youtube. This needs to be taken to the FTC to force them to work together. Amazon does not have the faith in their own products to keep selling. I have no intention to get any Google Device. I did have one, but I quickly got rid of it. My house is full of Amazon devices. Now I have to consider sending the Show 2nd gen back, as it won't do what I bought it for, which is watch Netflix.

He has become so frustrated with the process of constantly asking to play songs that can't be found, and going to Youtube and getting bumped off so frequently that in a few days he said he does not want to use it anymore because it is too stressful.\nMy internet search shows this is an inherent problem with the system and many have sited this short coming with Alexa.

The Google Home Hub does a lot of this already as well from my experience with it.\n\nThe sound is quite decent, the form factor is good, the screen is nice, it's still an echo and has alexa.

Even though others have reviewed the limitations of the show, it was difficult for me to picture how a device so beautiful could be so useless for streaming video.\n\nI can't get flash and netflix to work on it through chrome. This means I can't get my cable tv and online dvr to play from the xfinity website on this device. I just don't see how I can use this unless I fork over hundreds of dollars to purchase prime videos and tv. Even though I have prime and the first season of a show is listed as free - the show told me I needed to go to the webiste and pay for the tv show in order to watch it.\n\nSo, if you are happy watching whatever show manges to scrounge up for you or you really want this for video conferencing/camera monitoring, I would give this a hard pass. Yes, the sound is decent but I tried placing mine against a wall (normal) and the sounds is awful and bounces of the wall. This really needs to be placed a couple of feet away from a wall.

It works well listening streaming music, radio, and some movies. Streaming movies that work well on my phone and laptop DON'T work well on the echo show. I suspect the echo is simply too slow to handle the job. I have a 5-year-old tablet that is somewhat slow such that some movies stutter and time out. The echo show behaves the same way such that it stutters and breaks up the movie. If I simultaneously watch the same movie on my laptop, phone and echo show; only the echo show messes up. However, if I watch an old YouTube black-and- white western on echo show, I don't notice any problem. I suspect the echo show is simply too slow for HD movies. Echo show will read kindle books to me as audio, but surprisingly kindle on echo doesn't show the text. Echo show doesn't respond to seemingly obvious commands for kindle.

Perfect for elderly parents.","reviewDate":"January 14, 2019","reviewText":"I bought the Echo Show two-pack at a great price because I had recently purchased Ring doorbells for our house and our parents home. We wanted to be able to see who was at the door in either location before having to go answer the door because stairs in a split-level home are becoming more of a problem as they age.\n\nI also wanted our parents to be able to see who was at the door without having to worry about constantly carrying a phone or finding it every time the doorbell rang. The Echo Show just sits on the table near where they sit most of the time and a simple voice command can let them see and talk to whoever is there.\n\nAlthough it kinda seems like 'spying,' it also gives us peace of mind to know that when our daughter is supposed to pick up Grandpa at 1:00p for his doctor appointment, she actually shows up on time. We have video evidence of the comings and goings at our parent's home. And if she doesn't show, guess who is getting an emergency 'get your butt over there now' call!\n\nI work from home, so I placed the second unit in my upstairs office so I can do the same thing... see who it is and determine whether I have to drop everything to answer the door. If a signature is required on a package, the carrier at least knows someone is on the way down, and I don't have to go to the post office to pick up 'missed deliveries.' This alone made it worth the cost of the Show in time saved going to the post office 2-3 times a month.\n\nAs an added benefit, my father-in-law likes to follow the markets, and Alexa can intermittently and automatically show him any stocks or market conditions he's interested in.\n\nEcho Show makes caring for elderly parents so much easier and relieves a lot of worry about 'not knowing'. We use the DROP IN feature to check in with them occasionally. They do the same with us if they need anything. Any of the Echo/Alexa setups can do the same thing, but sometimes there is no substitute for being able to see the other person.\n\nAnd finally, as one of many other added benefits, with Alexa no question goes unanswered, and with Amazon Music there isn't a song they can remember that they can't hear again on a moment's notice. They often wonder who an actress is on an old movie and as long as you know the name of the movie you can get a list of cast members for pretty much anything. And last Christmas we were over there and heard coming from the other room, \"Alexa, play Burl Ives Christmas music.\" (Now there's something you don't hear every day....) But by golly, Burl Ives Christmas music came up with lyrics, and the room was filled with \"Holly Jolly Christmas\" and a lot of other great old songs I'd never heard.

We also have the Google Home. The Alexa has an amazing sound speaker, but be aware that you cannot play multiple songs on multiple devices without a $15 a month charge. This is very frustrating. I have a family of six, each person owning a dot and we have the show. The kids all want to set their own alarms and reminders and it is quite frustrating. This technology Seems like it is in its infancy, unfortunately. Alexa get stumped very easily on questions, and you have to have just the right wording. However she does search for recipes and you can scroll through them and pick the one you want. That is helpful in the kitchen. It does have a large selection of music on Amazon music, however to get an unlimited amount, again, you have to pay for it. This is why we got the Google home as well, So we can get what we need without the hassle of trying to re-word every question we ask Alexa. That being said, the Google Home and the minis do not have good sound systems. They are decent, but Alexa blows them out of the water with her sound system."},{"reviewerName":"bananafarm","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Died after 30 minutes","reviewDate":"July 15, 2019","reviewText":"The device is a huge disappointment overall. The biggest problem is that sound died after 30 minutes, and won't come back even after powering off and on and resetting the device. It's pretty useless at this point without sound.\n\nThe software is also rather awful:\n- Ring integration is sluggish. Half the time, the camera stream won't appear. The rest of the time, it takes about 30 seconds for the stream to come up, and even then it's very pixelated.\n- The device is very slow. Every menu takes several second to load, including the back button.\n- The developers don't understand hit targets. A lot of the buttons, such as the back button, are difficult to hit with your finger because they're so small.\n\nYou're better off buying an iPad and keeping it always on."},{"reviewerName":"skylab","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Prime Day Echo Show Fail - No Sound","reviewDate":"July 19, 2019","reviewText":"I received an Echo Show 2nd Gen that has non-functioning sound.

I'll keep the other one to talk back and keep it it in the bedroom or office to replace the alarm clock.\n\nTo make this better Amazon needs to make the screen more functional. Just give us a control panel with different screens. Let us put the home automation controls in there so that I can view (and change) the settings of all of the items in my smart home setup. THAT is what this should be. Actually I've been using one of my Echo Shows in the same room as my Fire TV Cube and that setup is almost impossible. I just wish this was functional with the voice control turned OFF and that this and the Cube could work together rather than against each other as this would be a perfect control/info panel.

I originally had it this review at 3 stars for that issue but now that it's fixed I am updating the review to 5 stars. The sound quality and microphone are way better than the first gen echo show.

For my philips hue lights I have different groups for each room they are in set up in my alexa app and I can have alexa turn on/off each group of philips hue lights one group at any time I want and she will do it perfectly.

However, the Audio failed within a week. Alexa would get the commands but then was not able to output sound. I called and asked and hoped there might be an easy fix or a new device might be sent fairly quickly as a replacement . Instead, they had me ship the unit back for evaluation and repair if possible, or replacement if not. I finally heard back with an email that wanted a clarification of address so they could send the unit. I responded immediately to the email with the chat option. Here I spent 40 minutes before they could even determine the device I was trying to get help on and then they finally reported that they couldn't proceed with the promised repair or replacements. Instead, they had the audacity to suggest I buy another device and they would refund this later. So... Now they have my money and my device and their solution was to ask me to purchase ANOTHER device. I asked for a refund. I'm still waiting to see if that goes through.

Making video calls with family members on the second generation Echo Show allows us to be closer with a larger viewing area, crystal clear video and quality sound. Watching videos on the 10.1\" HD screen or listening to music with the premium sound speakers while completing daily tasks has made these daily tasks so much more pleasant. In addition, using the recipes to make new dishes is so much easier to read and follow. Answering the Ring Video doorbell or watching a live view of your outdoor areas through the second generation Echo Show provides you the ability to view who is at your door or view your surroundings while standing across the room from the Echo Show.

Gen is not good as the Echo period. The biggest problem is and I think it is the most important one and that is... Voice Reconition. If there is any little noise around while you are talking to Alexa, Alexa will not understand. You will wait and nothing will happen. Will not give you any indication that is not understanding either. Plus, the receiver (mic.) volume is super low so in general you have to scream for Alexa to get it. I wish it had a microphone volume adjustment it is this unit not there yet. By the way this is my second 2nd. Gen version too, I returned one for the same reason already.. This 2nd. one it started OK. but now is back to not understanding again.

I find that the dimming function makes the display on the Show so soothing that sleeping in the same room is no problem. The sound is great.

On my original Show the screen would automatically go to sleep after several minutes. If the 2nd gen has that setting I cannot find it. The best I can find is to tell it to turn the screen off. Why not a setting for sleep with several time options. Last, my original show came with a very nice screen saver set of beautiful pictures from around the world. The 2nd gen comes with a slide show of pastel water color type drawings or a blank gray screen. There is an option to upload and create your own slideshow.

I have cable and can access the app. If everything you have is Amazon, you will like this product but if you purchase entertainment from other companies like Netflix, Google, or HBO, you need to know this product does not support them."},{"reviewerName":"Michael Erickson","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Quilty product, sturdily-made","reviewDate":"November 16, 2018","reviewText":"I'm satisfied with my purchase. It does what it's claimed to do. I bought it as an upgrade to the Aamazon Dot I got a year ago. The crystal clear sceen is excellent - very sharp colors for any picture or video you might play. I'm not that into music, although I do you it occasionally for that. I mostly enjoy watching YouTube Videos on it.\n\nIn regards to YouTube access, you just ask Alexa \"Open Silk\" to open its browser, and use the touch screen to open YouTube. I found it easy to use. It's cumbersome typing in the specific video you want, so it's best to touch the microphone icon and simply speak the name of the video. Once videos appear, you can use the screen to scroll to the one you want.\n\nI only have a couple minor complaints: The screen is always on unless you tell Alexa \"Screen Off\". But if you happen to bump the screen with your hand or arm, it comes back on. There is no \"off\" button. You can use the Do Not Disturb feature to have the screen be off at specific times, but again, if you accidently touch the screen again, it comes on.\n\nSecondly, the reviews rave about the sound quality. But I've found that the bass seems to be pretty strong, resulting in a sort of a muffled sound when Alexa responds to a question. You have to adjust the volume in those cases where the voice isn't super clear. The voice on the Echo Dot is clearer at times in comparison. At least that's my opinion. Others may disagree.\n\nOverall, I really like this product. It's screen is big, but the unit isn't much bigger than the screeen so it doesn't take up a lot of space on a counter or table. I don't use the Echo Show every day, but I'm still glad I spent the money on it."},{"reviewerName":"Greg","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Wonderful","reviewDate":"January 21, 2019","reviewText":"I bought this for my 85 y/o mother for Christmas.

This Echo Show plays all our favourite Live TV channels (CNN, Fox, Cozy, Boomerang for kids .......) available on Hulu. This is indeed a new chapter in Television entertainment.

Playing movies and such is also not convenient. I have several fire sticks and they work great and way easier then the Show.

Vibrant screen, nice sound quality and I have gone a little crazy adding switches and plugs to automate EVERYTHING. My only complaint with the Echo devices is Alexa integration. I have the Show in the kitchen and a DOT in the living room. When playing music it’s cool that I can create a group and play on both devices at the same time but that’s where the integration seeems to end. For example, we are in the kitchen and set a time. Then we go sit down in the living room. The timer goes off and we say, “Alexa, stop timer” however Alexa in the living room responds,”There are no timers set” which means we have to get up, get closer to kitchen Alexa and repeat the command. Kind of defeats the purpose of automation.

There are so many more things the Echo Show can do and I don't want to bore you with listing them all.

Like to use Spotify? Good luck getting to what you want and where you want...but pay for Amazon Music and options open. Use Netflix? Not on this device. Hulu will work better (which nobody uses btw).\n\nMost frustrating is that everything is done by voice. This big beautiful screen has no way to touch your way to your music or videos.\n\nFor me, Google's device or a simple tablet would do so much more.

Just prior to the purchase of the Show, Sling informed me it wouldn’t support older iOS systems so my days of enjoying it on my iPad was numbered. I did a bit of research and decided on the Show and traded Sling for Hulu +. I am enjoying it immensely with only a few complaints. I have a HBO subscription on my Prime Video but unable to access it on the Show which is disappointing. Also, I will be watching something and when I ask the Show to turn on or off the lights or drop in to another room it doesn’t return to the program. Lastly, Alexa is so much louder than the programming so am always physically turning up or down the volume. I know, 1st world problems right?

Screen wise it is, speakers, there's too much base (there is an EQ, even with the base turned all the way down, still too much base). The other issue is the speakers facing away from you, behind the device. The first gen unit I could hear throughout my apartment at lower volumes, the second gen unit, I can't unless I really turn it up loud. As I said my apartment, I use my Echo Show as an alarm clock, and listen to music while I wake up. Getting back to the base issues, the last thing I figure my neighbors want to hear is the base coming from my Echo Show as base travels very well through walls. So if you live in an apartment, and you wish to use this device as an alarm clock, I would advise finding a gen 1 Echo Show instead, as it's a much better choice, even with the smaller screen size."},{"reviewerName":"Mary Claire","rating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Lag time to respond to touch and voice - disappointed!","reviewDate":"August 2, 2019","reviewText":"I own a slew of Amazon/Alexa devices: 3 fire sticks, a fire tv an echo and three dots in addition to the ring alarm and multiple ring cameras. I’ve loved all of their products up to this point but the Echo Show 2nd Gen is underwhelming to say the least. The key issue I have is with lack of responsiveness to touch or voice. Touch is a 50/50 to work and I often have to tap things multiple times. If it does work there’s major lag. For example: I swipe left from the right side of the screen to pull up my smart home controls, it take two or three seconds for it to actually do it on the screen. It’s like an old computer that lags. Voice is much the same. For a $229 product it’s unacceptable. Unfortunately I’ll be selling mine and hoping for a better product in future generations. Sadness.

I thought it was creepy knowing it can listen in and take pictures/video. I have to change my opinion now, I love having it around. I love being able to listen to music or watch videos, check the weather or ask Alexa anything and everything. I just turned 50 and I love my 80's hairband groups. I can just say. \"Alexa play 80's rock music or one hit wonders\" and in a blink of an eye there it is and the screen shows the lyrics. If I don't like the choice I then say \"Alexa stop, next\" things like that and the songs change. I can also make calls while busy walking around. I can watch recipe videos to show each step. I can connect my pictures to see them on the screen.\nI forgot to mention the sound quality is amazing and you can change the sounds to your own preferences.\nI'm really new to this device and still learning but it can do SO much. I want to get a door bell that connects to this device and I can say \"Alexa show me the front door\" I then can see the front of the house. Or when someone rings the bell it shows me who it is, some even have two way microphones. You can buy special plug adapters to plug household items in and then you can control using \"Alexa\" to operate it, like TV's, lights, routers to control your kids time allowed on the internet. I know there are many more things it can do but I'm still learning. I didn't think I'd like or want anything like this in my home, boy was I wrong.

The visual display is crisp and certainly suitable for displaying images, through I prefer a larger screen to watch video at home. Voice recognition, even across from a small room while playing music is dependable. It is configurable so that the screen only displays time when not in use so not to be distracting.

And why even set up a home wallpaper if the screen just goes to black constantly, I never get to enjoy my wallpaper? Finally, only two weeks after I purchased this it went on sale and I got screwed out of $50. I'm very disappointed with Amazon's price guarantee/match policy.

The Echo show just have some simple repeated artworks and cycle trending news, it gets old very quick. Unless you create your own album to let it cycle.

I have a Echo and an Echo Dot, but having the screen and other added features make it well worth the price. I am able to connect my Ring video doorbell up to the Show to see who's at the front door. Also, I can see the words to songs that are playing on Prime Music. Speaking of sound, It sounds much better than all the other Echo devices... Clear sound with nice bass (Has an equalizer that you can tweak). There is also a lot of Bluetooth tech capabilities like using it as an external speaker for your TV or Stereo. The wallpaper is customizable as well. You can have the Show display your photo library or a specific picture for the main wallpaper background. The touch screen is also a nice touch. Hopefully they will update the Echo Show to include more touch screen options like a tablet.

I wish it would automatically show video in order to give you a faster response. I have a bulb in a tall floor lamp beside my chair that works with Alexa. The light is a little out of reach for me and all I have to do is tell Alexa to turn the light on and can be dimmed too, works great.

Beasom","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great device, but background pictures continue to loop and not cycle correctly","reviewDate":"February 11, 2019","reviewText":"These devices are great. I own two of them. The display is sharp looking and the sound quality is fantastic. As a digital picture frame they are terrible. The problem even occurs on the gen 1 Echo show. I am talking about the background picture display and NOT the slideshow mode that is also possible on these devices.\nFor the background, I choose a folder of pictures from Prime Photos. It cycles the photos every 90 seconds or so while showing the overlays I have selected (weather, drops ins, sports scores) and also transitions between the Amazon trending topics. At least once a week, it will get stuck on a picture and never change it unless I power cycle. Also, when it gets to the last photo in the album, it will usually just go back and show the last 10 pictures again, rather than start back over at the beginning.\nI have contacted Amazon product support about this and they ignored me. I am not a software engineer, so perhaps programming for pictures is a very difficult thing. It is possible though, as I've seen other devices do it. I would also like to see some options for the background pictures, such as picture duration/speed and a shuffle option. This request to Amazon has fallen on deaf ears too. Maybe they just don't care.\nI have tried about everything I can to fix this/trick it to work and have not had luck. Others I know have the same issues with background pictures. I would use the slideshow mode, but it doesn't display any overlays or additional information. If Amazon would fix this I would give it a higher score.\n\nUPDATE: The show devices keep getting worse for using as picture displays. I have an album I use as the background (not the slideshow feature). It changes between a photo in the album and the Amazon trending content. Every 3 cycles the picture changes to the next one in the album. It has got progressively worse. It used to get stuck on a picture forever, unless I reset it. Then it would get to the end of the album and instead of starting over, jump back about 10 pictures or so and loop them. Now, it skips pictures in the album randomly and gets stuck in a loop randomly in the album. This keeps getting worse. This should not be that hard to program."},{"reviewerName":"Thor","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Seems unfinished...","reviewDate":"June 3, 2019","reviewText":"First off, sound is fantastic for such a little device.

I've had to reboot this unit several times since receiving because it either locked up or for some reason powered off by itself. If this wasn't so expensive, I would probably be more forgiving, but at $200 I expect more.\n\nScreen quality is good, video playback is good as well. Touchscreen responsiveness is also good.

It does everything that the page says. What the page doesn't say is that the ES doesn't run a web browser (Chrome, Edge, etc.). You can't run common programs like Thunderbird or Gmail email programs. It doesn't stream from Netflix.\nWhat this really reminds me of is a smartphone in a larger box plus wireless bluetooth speakers. If you want to control everything in your house with Zigbee devices do Skype-like video phone calls it will do that. It has many links to content providers, many of which will charge you extra for their service.\nIf this is what you want, the ES will probably satisfy you.

Works just like an eDot, but more interesting with video.. Love the recipe photos, step by step instructions voice controlled, also downloaded 2 recipe Skills one being the Food Network & All Recipes, so quite extensive. Spelling, now you also see the word. Shows any calculation, if you don’t get all the numbers after the decimal point. Weather shows current statistics, followed by forecast. News in some cases you see the person reading the news. Music playing shows the lyrics. Trending topics — some are interesting. Down graded ratings because speakers face backward. Bass level better than an eDot, but not that much better, because of the direction. Works well with Hulu. Overall summary, everything is a little better and more interesting with video.\nOops I should have worded that differently. The Echo Show doesn’t automatically show Ring video when the doorbell is pressed. You must say, Alexa who’s at the front door — then it takes 7 to 8 seconds.

Then if we use Alexa, I have to go back to the photo album manually again.

The original Echo had excellent sound quality, but the Echo Show 2 surpasses that easily.\n\nNow for the bad:\nSkype Integration:\n1. I wish I would be able to see my Skype contact on the screen, Alexa has a hard time understanding names that are not common - I need to confirm the chosen contact every time I ask her to initiate a call.\n2. My video feed keeps getting stuck, and I need to stop/start the camera in order to release it.\n3. Call will disconnect, and Alexa will claim there's no internet connection, while it's connected to my home network, and all the others devices connected to the home network are operating without an issue. I have to stop/start the WiFi to get things working again.\n4. When you're on a Skype call, or calling someone, or someone calling you - Alexa is essentially absent, she will not respond to any commands.\nSpotify Integration is clunky at best. The device will only show up in the main Amazon account holder Spotify.\nIt will lose synchronization with the device that \"cast\" the music over, and will sometimes disappear altogether from the list of available devices (old Echos in my home don't have that issue). Only a full restart will fix the problem - why the hell isn't there an on/off button on this thing ???\nVideo streaming - no NETFLIX integration, really???? I can leave without YouTube, but I think most people have Netflix and not HULU, this doesn't seem to much of a big deal to fix... but it's been almost a year since this was launched, so I'm not keeping my hopes up.\nPrime Video - works only for the main Amazon account holder - why can't other accounts connected to my account, and also authorized to use Alexa can't watch Prime Video? Also, the UI is horrible, really hard to get to where you want, and if I try to use Alexa to do this: \"Alexa, Play Bosch\" it plays the first episode of the first season, while I'm actually watching the fourth season now.\nSmart home - same issue with the accounts. Smart home devices only show up on my account, what's the point of having a household in Amazon, if nothing works for the other members.\n\nThis is more a vent than a review, but it's a lot of small things that make a device that has great potential to something really mediocre."},{"reviewerName":"YURI","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Newest edition is Awesome","reviewDate":"November 3, 2018","reviewText":"Very nice, this is my third one, love them, grandson approved also for his bedroom, he can play his own music and watch different programs on it, great sound too, family loves them, great for security also just ask Alexa show me the front door, and there it is.

You must be aware that when asking Alexa questions, you have to phrase it just right or she may not understand, although I am impressed with the amount of commands/questions she can respond to.

Muddy appears to be due to an over engineered sub woofer piping (trying to increase resonance in a small space) which causes a muddy less accurate sound. The screen is fine the touch is fine.

Asking Alexa how to do it is a joke. Alexa doesn't know 'jack' about how she works or can be configured. Going to the Alexa app is a total waste of time, there is no information there about the best way to integrate your Skype contacts into a Skype connection. I can't even really tell which phonebook Alexa is using (I have three contact lists) or how to switch from one to the other. One even wonders why on earth there is a screen on this device.

I can set up alerts with my brinks doorbell camera, my blink xt outdoor camera or my inside wyze cam. If someone is at the door all I have to say is Alexa show me the front door and Bam camera is on live view.

You can turn your light on and off, but the scenes don't work very well. To dim or brighten you may have to tell it a percent amount, and just forget about any color scenes for your lights, it doesn't know that. But it can do math and act as an egg timer.

A bit annoyed that I can’t tell Alexa to pull up a YouTube video. Seems Alexa answered question when I first plugged in now seems she doesn’t know anything. Have asked her things I asked Her the first day and now says she doesn’t know. I think amazon screwed themself when they blocked google from using their things now we suffer more. I would have recommended but now I don’t, to many cons this was just a few cons I’ve listed and not enough pros. The pros good video chat, good to pull recipes up will keep it on a good amount of time. Like how you can put her to sleep so tv doesn’t command her. Like the few workouts they have, wish they would add more apps though. The Smart device hookup is good and does have a lot to offer.

I do wish it had the ability to access other apps like Netflix and such. Additionally, it's a bit off when I attempt to pull up programs from Amazon Video. Doesn't get it right most the time when I use voice. I usually have to find my program by using the touch screen. Which the latter makes it more like I could set my tablet up and use it more conveniently. But as time has gone by I'm getting better at speaking the language the Echo Show understands in order to voice my selections better but it still is frustrating more often than not. The speaker/mic quality of this device is very good in my opinion. Another feature that I find pretty good is the screen brightness ability where it senses the environment and adjusts accordingly.

I've noticed no improvement in voice recognition compared to the Echo gen 1, Echo spot and Echo Show. The different LED lights that indicate whether you have an alert , message, delivery or any of the other statuses have been removed. There is no visual indication that triggers you to check the device if you're not next to it anymore. If you happen to be next to the device and the notification appears it disappears within four seconds so you barely have any time to read it. When a reminder appears on the screen it's always shows the current time at that moment that you are looking at the screen. it's very confusing if you look at the screen after the time that a reminder first appears because the screen always shows the current time next to the reminder instead of the time reminder was due. You can't tell how many minutes have passed just a reminder became due. I definitely prefer the Generation 1.

First the sound just stopped working, the echo looked like it heard me and even did what I asked it but not a single sound came out. I was able to fix this problem by unplugging and plugging back in the power cord 6 times. That brought back the sound. Then the videos stopped playing on Amazon video and hulu.

I took it off the extended network and put it on the main network and it works fine. So, I still had the first one and did the same for that one and now it works fine. Three days in and they are both responding every time. Awesome!\n\nAlso, I had purchased a google home hub and it doesn’t work well with an iPhone. It’s more difficult to set up and sync then Alexa.

Very useful since I work from home sometimes. It also has a browser (2 actually), so you can get to things like YouTube with a couple steps. It gets plenty loud if you want it to. Alexa is getting better at answering questions asked with natural language, but there are still times when I feel like I have to memorize a specific way to ask for certain functions.

There is no built in calendar display to look at although I can verbally schedule appointments to a linked calendar. If I want to peruse the calendar, on the Show I'm out of luck. Upcoming events for the next day do show up but it would be nice to be able to configure it to show me (n) days in advance.\n\nContacts are also a problem. Although I have my contacts linked and they do show up in my Android Alexa app on my phone, only 5 of those contacts show up in the Echo Show.

Bigger screen is a huge plus. Speaker sound quality is much better than the 1st gen. I paired mine with the Alexa Sub woofer and have good all around sound, but not quite bose quality.\n\nI tried bluetooth pairing with an AIWA speaker and the functionality was awkward. It would play music through the AIWA at one point and no other sounds would play, such as Alexa responding. When it finally connected with Alexa responding and music then I would get a thump out of the AIWA speaker every several seconds. If you are looking for the sound quality as I was, I highly recommend considering the Alexa sub woofer."},{"reviewerName":"Caitlin","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Expensive for not being perfect","reviewDate":"August 20, 2019","reviewText":"For a speaker all around the sound could be better, with it behind the device, you can’t have it against a wall or anything it needs to be centered somewhere, I don’t want a big screen in the middle of a counter, I want it pushed back.

I wish when looking for a recipe it showed them from all over google, instead if I want a specific one i find on my laptop or cellphone it won’t show me it, only ones Alexa suggests unless I go to internet and do it myself, but then it times out and won’t scroll or answer “what’s next?” for you."},{"reviewerName":"Stonington","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"A few things share the name......","reviewDate":"January 11, 2019","reviewText":"This device just doesn't live up to the hype.

I'm also not a huge fan of having Alexa suggestions as a background. I mainly purchased this for smart home integration.

The device leaves me wondering why it is designed the way it is. Most in-depth browsing is not as easy as just using the Amazon app on my tablet or phone. For instance, you need to browse movies by voice, which is much slower and more cumbersome than seeing a list of possible episodes, along with a written description of what the movie is about.\nAlso, Alexa is not good at hearing what I want to play, and often the touch screen just does not respond as expected. A common experience for me is to hover over the device, waiting for a response to voice command or touch command. I hate to say it, but this product would be better with some kind of non-voice input, like a remote or even an on-screen keyboard.\nI would not recommend this to a friend, not until it works better."},{"reviewerName":"Eric","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Show 2 - Updated review","reviewDate":"July 19, 2019","reviewText":"Update: The first one I got must have been a lemon. Once I unplugged it, packed it up for shipping and removed it from my account everything worked perfectly. I can unplug the one I have now and plug it back in without any of the issues mentioned below. I am very happy with this addition to my collection.\n\nThe show2 is a great addition to my collection of amazon devices. I have 2 dots, an echo, and now the show2. I really like the screen resolution and the sound is great. My only complaint is when I set up a music group. The initial setup of the group works great. The buggy part comes in when you unplug the show2 to move it. Once you plug it back in and tell alexa to play music \"everywhere\"(my group name) the music plays on all the devices but the show2. At this point the show will display the lyrics but no sound comes out of it. If you tell alexa to turn off the music it will. But if you ask alexa on the show2 any question after this occurs you can see her response on the screen but still no sound at all. After trying to figure out what the issue was by messing with the volume and a whole host of other things I figured I just got a defective one. I called support and they had me try several things like rebooting but nothing seemed to fix the no sound issue. They sent me out a replacement. While I was waiting I kept trying to get it to work. I finally gave up in frustration and just unplugged it. Fortunately I am not one to just let things go so I plugged it back in after a couple of hours and low and behold it worked with the \"everywhere\" group again. As long as did not unplug it everything worked great.\n\nOnce the replacement showed up I did a test with it. I set it up in the \"everywhere\" group and started playing music. I then unplugged it. At that point I went to one of my other devices and told alexa to turn the music off but it would not turn it off. I went and plugged the replacement show2 back in and all of a sudden the music turned off. Crazy right?\n\nSo what I have determined is that if a show2 is unplugged and then plugged back in there will be no sound and may have other issues related to the music group.\n\nThe solution at that point for me is just unplug it for a while and then plug it back in and the sound magically starts working again. Amazon need to figure out this bug with the show2 and the music group feature. I can unplug any of my dots or echo and plug them back in and they work just fine once they are booted up and online.\n\nSo if if you are thinking about getting one just be aware of this issue and hopefully Amazon will read this review and fix the bug.\n\nUpdate: The first one I got must have been a lemon. Once I unplugged it, packed it up for shipping and removed it from my account everything worked perfectly. I can unplug the one I have now and plug it back in without issue."},{"reviewerName":"BalletBabe","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"LOVE THIS NEW VERSION","reviewDate":"November 7, 2018","reviewText":"I have dots, and the original echo and the first Echo show.

I tried out other products before settling down on the Amazon devices. Now for the Show. I have added 2 of the Show 2 to my home. I absolutely love them. I have one beside my bed so at anytime I can check security cams throughout the house and talk to anyone who’s at the door. In add to an alarm, sleep aid with sleep sound skills, home intercom, speaker phone, I now have my own tv to catch up on prime movies or Hulu.\n\nMy personal opinion is simply this.

Amazon seems to be aware of this as well as when we called in they had a whole system to walk through and said it was a common issue (recall?)- one of the issues is that sound will just stop working which then requires you to reset the device multiple times (which means plugging it in and unplugging it over and over) this error/glitch also effects the screen or sometime the start up of the show. - and the whole device is out of warranty coverage in like 30 days or something from purchase. This first happened to us about 15 days after we got it - in hindsight should have probably exchanged it then - but we hoped it was a one time thing - however this is turning into a weekly routine at this point. Besides that the device is great - screen is beautiful sound quality top notch, for what it is, and our kids (4-2) love it. They can ask for pictures of fish and then scroll through images on the touch screen or to play their favorite song or ask for their kids show on Hulu or the time or weather etc. It really enables them to be able to interact and explore without the ability to type and spell - which for them is very empowering."},{"reviewerName":"Alan","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Boring","reviewDate":"September 5, 2019","reviewText":"No significant change compared to the 1st generation, besides size.

Will see how Amazon handles it and update my review accordingly.\n\nEDIT: So, after living with this thing for a while, my rating remains a solid ‘1’. Here are some things to think about before buying:\n\n- Customer support. On the plus side, Amazon reached out to me regarding the faulty sound on this device. Unfortunately, though, their “fix” isn’t a fix at all, unplugging the chord from the back of the device is a subpar workaround at best. Worse, there’s apparently no plan for a real fix for these defective devices.\n\n- The faulty sound issues persist, bringing three thoughts to mind for me\n— Does Amazon really think unplugging and replugging the product is a satisfactory fix for this $200 device?\n— How many times does Amazon think we’ll be able to pull the plug and reinsert before the plug breaks? (the answer is not many)\n— How much use will a device that has to be rebooted every time you want to hear something get? (the answer is not much)\n\n- The device is inordinately slow. Even standing directly in front of it and speaking directly to it, my other devices in other rooms answer before the Show can\n\n- Lack of content. I agree with some of the others who have said this is basically an expensive echo dot. Yes, it’s nice to watch Amazon Prime Video or Hulu, but where is YouTube, Netflix, etc. Same with the communication capabilities. They are much too limited\n\n- Too few home screen options. The home screen can’t be customized to do anything useful and can’t be set not to turn off automatically ... or to not turn on every time you pass by\n\n- Limited compatibility with other hardware. If you have already purchased video cameras/doorbells, etc that Amazon doesn’t advertise, you’re likely to be headed back to the store to purchase new equipment\n\nAll-in-all, I’d say this is a device whose time has not yet come, in terms of hardware quality, utility, and usability. It’s a shame ... big promise, little result. Amazon should recall these defective units today!"},{"reviewerName":"Sean H","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"No apps no home screen no streaming platform ...","reviewDate":"July 22, 2019","reviewText":"This device is an echo spot that accidentally snuck into a show 2. It is missing any sort of interface liike a home screen where you select apps. Or internet so that is frustrating. It is also missing even the Amazon fire tv set up of shows. There is no menue to select from, like every other menue on every other device they created ie fore tv fire stick, fire tablet, Web browser.\n\nIm short it is a completly new set up with almost no funtionality for tv watching. It is missing netflix and you tube apps. Despite reviews above saying you can use the web browser you can NOT, per the patch that initiates upon startup. In fact you can not even watch amazon prime video on thier own browser it blocks you out.\n\nIn closing it is a great idea that missed ita mark completly as if two different departments are fighting for popularity (tablet, smart home, fire tv) and they dont like to use eachother streaming platforms.

He had read the reviews and thought itcwpuld be a great asset in our kitchen. I believe that the ‘integration’ with things like our dish network and things was strongly misrepresented. Yes it integrates with these other programs, but you can’t actually use the dish app on the Amazon Show, you can only control whats showing on your tv with the Show. We thought we’d be able to stream these other services on our Show. Not the case. And what little user i terface there is is quite cumbersome to use. The lack of a homescreen where you can touch icons to do what you would like is frustrating (instead of using voice commands that Alexa doesnt always understand) This device sounds great. But you can buy a great speaker for much less than the price of his device. It is quite limited in its funtionality. Overall in our house, its basically a digital screen saver that plays music.

If you tell Alexa to “go home” while playing a video, the video will continue playing for up to 10 seconds before finally turning off and returning to the home screen. Very annoying. it seems worse with Hulu than with Prime Video.\n\nWhen using with recordings from the FireTV Recast, it is quite unresponsive when using the touchscreen to play individual videos, you may need to tap on a video 3 or more time to get it to play.

However, if you do not have a smart phone, you cannot actually set it up. We bought it for video calling between older family members, who do not have smart phones in their life.

I asked my google device the same questions and it finds the answer right away (without having to unnaturally rephrase my question a few times).\n\nIf anyone tries the Echo Show's or anything else Alexa (yes it does have good capabilities)... you should ask common questions about what store is in your town but not the big stores like Home Depot, Walmart, etc. Try to ask in a natural way but you may have to rephrase it a few times for the answer.\n\nTry to ask about a local business in your city/town and decide for yourself if Alexa will meet your needs and expectations. You may find yourself almost knowing all the information from the way you have to rephrase the question. You will understand when you start using it for real word information. Hopefully, Amazon/Alexa folks are working hard but there is still a long way to go.\n\nTry... \"Where is ______\" and it might know the answer how far away it is inaccurately... BUT it doesn't know the business hours (Google does). Try... ask directions to a known restaurant in your town that you know has a chain in another city... you might get \"sorry, I couldn't find what you're looking for\" or the chain that is far away (Google knew the local one I wanted and also sent directions to my phone).\n\nSome pluses... If you ask about restaurants in your town, it will show and tell you the names of a few on the screen (but I question how many it really knows). If it knows a business, you will see the information on the screen such as address, logo, store hours and it will verbally tell you where it is and the store hours.\n\nIf you want to like Alexa, do not use Google Home or Google Assistant. Once you do, you will start revealing the real world differences. I'd rate it 3.5 stars overall due to things being unnatural and not as fluent as the \"other\" device out there. Display is great.... I think if you let Amazon/Alexa KEEP your voice recordings/questions, the \"voice recognition\" would be 4 stars in a quiet environment but when you add in an A/C or a fan in the room it might not recognize as well unless you look at it and speak clearly and slightly louder.\n\nI hope this helps...but again, the Echo Show (2nd Gen) is great BUT has \"Alexa\" limitations you should be aware of."},{"reviewerName":"D.

The sound just stops working completely and needs to be hard reset. Some component inside the Echo Show Gen 2 is either overheating and shutting off or the power is being choked. Whatever it is it stops all sound from producing. I would open it up a reflow the solder or check the internal temps of some capacitors or transistors and see it if above operating temps but I don't want to void the warranty. After research, this seems to be a common issue. Don't get me wrong it's amazing sounds fantastic when its working and it is a great buy.

How can it be so much worse than my regular Echos, which can hear me say the wake word from across the room with my music playing almost as loud as it can go? I've tried different locations to see if that would help, but it hasn't.\n\nAfter using it for about a week the sound completely went out. It showed that music was playing, or indicated it was speaking, but no sound would come out. I had decided I had received a bad unit and was ready to ship it back when I found other people on the internet who were having the same problem. Turned out that if you pull the plug out from the back of the unit (but not the wall) it resets itself and you get volume back. The problem hasn't shown itself again.\n\nThen about a week later the Echo Show started responding very slowly, or not at all. The display would not power up when detecting someone nearby like it had when I first got it. Unplugging it and plugging back in has seemed to lessen the problem.\n\nThe Echo Show is definitely sluggish in responding to many actions. There's a noticeable delay after pushing a button or making a request that the action happens. Seems like a faster processor would solve a lot of that.\n\nI big gripe on not only this Echo Show, but also my regular Echos is the inability to set Alexa's speaking volume separately from media volume. If I have had music playing loudly the next request I make Alexa responds so loudly it can wake the entire household.\n\nOn the plus side, the sound quality is very good. Out of the box, the bass sounds somewhat boomy and muddled, but with the sound controls most of that can be eliminated. I'm still adjusting it, and it seems my adjustments for one type of music don't sound so good with other types. Custom presets for the type of music might be helpful.\n\nThe screen looks great! I was concerned initially because the specs weren't that great compared to some of the other devices I regularly use, but in practice it's bright and clear.\n\nThe unit itself is nicely designed and looks like a quality piece of equipment sitting on my countertop.\n\nTo sum up, overall the Echo Show does what you would expect it to do. It looks and sounds nice, but the big issue with it not hearing the wake word when loud media is playing is close to a deal-breaker. I have music playing almost constantly on it, and it not being able to detect me speaking is huge. There's enough I like about it that I'm keeping it in hopes Amazon releases an update that will improve its hearing."},{"reviewerName":"J. A.

I've also set a programmable timer (WiOn) to control snow melting mats on the stairs to be controlled by voice.\nThe information and 'Skills' are amusing and some are actually helpful.

Only has been good for playing music, but then it randomly plays videos late at night","reviewDate":"September 3, 2019","reviewText":"This thing is absolutely terrible and has been so incredibly frustrating! When I bought this, I also bought a smart camera, smart bulbs, and a smart thermostat, but these skills are constantly disconnecting from my Alexa and have not been worth the hassle to reconnect over and over again. When I add up the cost of the Echo Show, the camera, bulbs, thermostat, and Echo Dot that I also got, it makes me nauseous to think of the HUGE waste of money. We do enjoy using our Echo Show for Spotify, but the fact that this is the only use we are able to get out of it is ridiculous. On top of being mostly useless, it randomly plays videos ALL OF THE TIME, so we have to keep turning it on and off. Since we only use it for music, it is usually turned up pretty loud, and then it scares the crap out of us in the middle of the night when a video starts blaring. Maybe I just got a bad model since other reviews are decent, but it has been absolutely terrible for me, and I am bitter about how much money I wasted on this and the other devices to go with it."},{"reviewerName":"WVH","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great Alexa addition!","reviewDate":"November 10, 2019","reviewText":"Great sound quality.

Called service and through their phone issues I tried to follow their instructions but audio was worse than my show. I could not get manager. Called back and found out that they were having phone issues. Found that audio on music was ok but terrible on Alexa . This unit was definitely dead out of the box and I should have been offered a new product immediately but that was not the case so I asked for a return and full refund.

The mic worked fine and Alexa would respond to my commands visually on the screen but zero sound. After reading a few support forums, this one included, I was able to reset and unplug/replug twice before the sound finally worked. After a month of use and having to unplug to the device to move it, the sound stopped working again. No amount of resets and replugging would get this thing to work. A piece of junk if there ever was one. One shouldn't have to reset and fiddle around with a brand new device to have it work the way it should, being brand new and a product from Amazon.

I looked up how to get the sound to work & everything I tried didn't get it going. I thought \"great, I have to send this back already, I got a dud.\" I read somewhere that the speakers could come loose during travel & you can plug them back in. Then I realized the device I had is a different generation than the one I was reading about... So I put it back together & figured I'd just send it back. But then I turned it back on & it was working again. After about an hour of messing with it, the sound came back. However, that was a big turn off & hassle, especially since it was brand new. But anyway, I got it working.\n\nOther than that mishap in the beginning, I've had a fun time with it. It's pretty simple to get tasks & commands set up on your phone. I like having Alexa wake me up in the morning & saying goodnight to her & the screen turning off. I like having pictures that I choose scrolls in the background. I just don't like that I can't get rid of the \"try this\" suggestions at the bottom.

So I waited for a sale to try one out. Now I wish I had bought enough to replace my 1st Generation as well. I know I'll end up buying two more when they go on sale again. If I can wait that long that is... because these are that much nicer looking and the video & sound quality are both a definite improvement.\n\nI also much prefer the Echo Show over the Echo's without a screen. I won't be buying audio only ever again.\n\nAnd I'll probably just give my 1st Generation away as a gift to my parents and grandparents who would never buy their own.

She plays music and controls all the lights as well with the Kasa devices. The only reason I didn't give the new Show 5 stars is I feel the processor is a bit slow.

With the 2nd generation Echo Show you would expect the touch screen to have more functionality. Like if you touch the temperature, it would bring up the daily weather without having to ask Alex “what is today’s weather”. More “touch” interaction without the need for voice commands would be preferred. Such as, if i touch the screen while it is playing, I should get quick options like; Pause, Stop, Volume +/-, channel up/down whatever is relevant to the app/skill at the time.

I'm surprised to see how consistently high rated this unit is and can only assume my issue is more on the level of quality control. Almost daily, she will not respond to commands at all, and I have to cycle power to resolve this, which at least a power cycle consistently takes care of this. What's equally frustrating is when I play music, roughly 1 out of 5 times she'll act like she's playing a song (i.e. I can see lyrics moving on the screen) but no sound at all.

Alexa has a hard time of hearing me too and I find myself repeating things over and over for her to get it right and sometimes she outright doesn't respond.

We have great connection for internet So I'm not sure why this is never a clear view of them during the chats. also another downside when you ask it a question it has limited answers since it is not a search engine. It answers basic questions if you're cooking but nothing further than that. Honestly very disappointed in the product I was hoping for more. Hopefully they can fix these issues.

Movies etc. play crystal clear and the screen size is just right for my environment. Just excellent all around and has become a very good \"personal assistant\" to access information.

I have several Fire TVs, 1st Generation Echo, Echo Dot, several Echo Shows 1st generation, and the Echo Show 5. I purchased the 2nd generation because of the bigger screen. However, this device cannot recognize my smart devices, i.e. Ring Doorbell/Alarm, Smart light switches, etc. It sees the devices but you cannot control it via voice commands. I opened a Support Request back on July 31st and up to now, they still have not provided me a resolution. Support personnel Chris (1st call) and Mauricio (2nd call) were accommodating and followed up on my behalf. However, the 3rd person (Zack) was not helpful at all and gave me the impression that he wanted to hang up on me because he couldn't do anything. This is a shame. This type of company representation, especially in the front lines of support, should not be allowed. I may just end up returning this product.

It takes literally 10-15 seconds sometimes for it to execute the ask. I would say \"Alexa drop in kids room\" and there would be silence. And then you will hear the ding that it has dropped in. Also the voice recognition is terrible compared to the original. I could say the same command from my sink and the old show would understand it 95% of the time. The new show takes it 50% of the time.

The speakers on the echo show V2 sound fantastic with the bass produced quite literally astounding. I did have to turn the bass down just a tad to stop slight distortion at 100%. Otherwise i have clear, crisp audio on full blast with bass that easily fills a room. The large screen and amazon music are magic with lyrics scrolling across the very nice 720p display. The cooking capabilities are awesome and the ability to control my hue smart bulb lights using the built in zigbee hub is awesome! The screen although beautiful seems to be where amazon may have cheaped out or i may have just been very unlucky. I had my show running for a solid two weeks and sadly the screen couldn't keep up. I came home from work only to find long streaks going across my echo screen. For a device that is meant to be on 24/7 you'd think a better more reliable panel would've been installed. To make matters worse the policy for replacement is a joke. I called and was polity greeted to being told i'd have to send it in for repair rather than what I had expected. What should've happened is i should've had a new show sent out with prime shipping and a return label for the defective one. I understand that people lie to get a second product but that is where the customer would be charged for the second product upon failure to send back the defective one. So for now i am without my show for the next 4-5 business days. The customer should never have to experience down time or feel penalized for having a defective product.

Honestly haven't had it long enough to get the full effect.\n\nHOWEVER, if you are thinking of using it for anything that requires the screen to be on for more than 5-10 minutes at a time. DON'T. There is no way to turn off the screen sleep/timeout function. So if you are using to follow a recipe, better get it done before the screen goes to sleep. Watching a video? Better hope it's less than 5 minutes long. Amazon Music displays song lyrics...until the screen falls asleep after 5 minutes. Etc, etc, etc. It seems like, no matter what you are doing, if the screen is active, it will fall asleep after a very short period.\n\nI wish I had just purchased an Echo Dot...would have saved a ton of money and basically had the same level of satisfaction without the frustration.\n\nBTW...the screen timeout complaints have been around since the 1st generation release in 2017.

It connects with our ring camera so we can see who's at the front door. Other functionality for the camera is limited so we have to use the ring app on our phones. We also want to install a smart lock that works with the Echo Show preferably without having to buy another device (smart home hub). But it is nearly impossible to get accurate, detailed, concise information about what locks are compatible. Chat with Amazon reps was useless; they didn't even understand the questions. The Echo Show came with a smart bulb from Phillips. Again, you're on your own to figure out how to make this thing work. How stupid are Amazon and Phillips to offer this bundle then leave you hanging with no idea how to get it to work. It took a while for me to figure it out (and I have two engineering degrees and ran a tech department for years), but I still can't get it to show up in the Alexa app on my wife's iPhone.\nDepending on what you want to do and your level of tech savy, be careful buying this device."},{"reviewerName":"grannyB","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Easy to use technology","reviewDate":"December 23, 2018","reviewText":"I’m still learning all the things that can be done with my Echo Show and so far I’m loving it!

However, I'm having an issue with the Echo Show Gen II. On three separate occasions, Alexa's voice stopped working. The Show seemed to be hearing my questions and responding on the screen. However, there was no verbal response from Alexa. After doing some online research, this seems to be a common issue. Mostly with units purchased on or around Prime Day.\n\nI did find where Amazon tech support has offered a tempory workaround by recommending that you unplug the power cord from the back of the device and reconnect it after a few seconds. The process did restore Alexa's response voice for a few days until it stopped responding again. I hope there will be an eventual software update to correct this issue, or perhaps a replacement unit offered if this issue is a result of a bad batch. Other than this random issue, I am satisfied with the Echo products and Amazons service."},{"reviewerName":"Topher LD","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Alexa voice is hard to understand.","reviewDate":"April 21, 2019","reviewText":"The Echo Show has great sound quality when it comes to music & movies, however I find that the Alexa voice is very hard to hear & understand, even at max volume.

I can tell it to show my pictures and it does beautifly, but it defaults back to the home screen if any messages pop up. I also have an Amazon cloud cam, the echo show will tell you someone was detected at the front door but not give you a video feed to show you without you verbally telling it to do so each time.

You can't add multiple items at a time without stating the command with each item. It doesn't categorize so you end up with a long list in random order which is a pain when shopping. It seems the designers put no creative effort in product development. If you synch another app with a better list, you can't change the default on Alexa or delete the Alexa shopping list. Essentially, Amazon designs one of the most vanilla apps and then forces you to be stuck with it. Lately, our Alexa has been interrupting us with its own ideas of what it wants to show us which makes me wonder if Amazon is starting a partnership with advertisers. The call video feature is nice and the music ability but overall I'd say Alexa isn't very AI smart in comparison to other products.

I have multiple dots in my home. But this one is junk for as expensive as it is. Would not recommend to anyone!!! Needs Alot of improvement before it should have been sold to the public. The two biggest things I bought one with a screen for was to watch a little TV in bed and my cameras. Especially the nursery camera, and it fails miserably at both. Rarely will actually play anything on prime. And it's about 50/50 on pulling up camera feeds and even when it does it will only show a few seconds worth before it goes back to the home screen. With both prime and cameras it usually says \"OK\" when you tell it to open them and then never actually does anything.

Bought gen1 Show at release and was foolish enough to jump into gen2. Compared to gen1 Echo Show, gen2 has a larger screen... but since you still can't customize what is displayed when you're not using it, the added utility is limited. Gen2 is also significantly worse at hearing commands. Don't be surprised to repeat yourself 3...4...5...6 times before gen2 listens or you lose your patience and just give up. On top of that, these devices keep losing functionality -- first we lost Youtube. This week we lost Bloomberg TV, which is now only available on Fire TV and after the Youtube loss was almost the only video I would play on my Show. As it stands, I would not recommend this device; they need to fix the microphone config and figure out better licensing arrangements with content providers."},{"reviewerName":"Bev","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great purchase - Very happy!!","reviewDate":"July 26, 2019","reviewText":"Love it!

And then if I leave it unplugged she will play the show on the Show. You hae got to be kidding, right? Also, you can't pause Hulu shows. When you try to resume, nothing happens and you have to wait for her to reload the show all over again. The more I use this device, the more it frustrates me.\nUpdate:\nWith some help from Amazon, I was able to find the Firefox browser to pull up recipes on my own (I had been trying to find a Silk browser. Because Amazon). So much happier with usability as a kitchen companion. But still difficult to figure out how to get other things done (Alexa couldn't find purchased music in my library).

All in all a good product. Now what they need to work on is making Alexa more like a search engine because I find myself asking her things that she should know but she doesn't or you have to be so specific in HOW you ask her the question.

You can all kinds of different things with it, ask weather, recipes, and the one thing I really thought was great you can tell it to play your favorite radio station (example Alexa play 97.1 the river which is a station out of Atlanta Ga.) and it will play it without any static. And it sounds as good or better than your regular home stereo. You can set alarm to wake you. I could go on & on but I'm sure you get my point. It is TOTALLY worth it, and very easy to use. My 60 year old cousin can even use it and he doesn't even know how to use a smartphone. He lives with me and I catch him all the time asking it questions thought that's cool.

We don't! The Alexa Communications Ap for calling contacts has to be installed on a smart phone. Without it you can not make visual calls. They down load your phone contacts through Alex Communications for Echo Show. We still have our two flipflops phone because it is only $50 a month for unlimited texting through Verizon designed for retirees on a fixed income. I hope Amazon doesn't ignore the grandparent market who would enjoy the visual phone calls of their grandchildren as advertised on the commercial and develops a software ap, so Alex Communications can be compatible with Office \"People contacts.\" Presently I use a Verizon text application on my computer so I can type texts on a real keyboard - my laptop when texting.

I never had an issue with the first gen. In fact the 1geb echo show is placed in another room and it will hear me over the echo show 2 even though it is in a room much farther away.

Sounds excellent for its size, Alexa integration is good, voice recognition is okay. Video is decent for its size. I was a happy customer until 7:01am this morning when I asked Alexa to set the alarm. Shortly after accepting the request, the speakers started popping, like a static sound. As if the speaker was blown. While listening to \"Real Jazz\" on Sirius XM. I'm not happy. Rarely have I had the volume above 8, the maximum being 10. C'mon man. This wasn't expected for a 2d generation model.\nWednesday morning, August 21, 2019."},{"reviewerName":"Mj","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great product..","reviewDate":"April 21, 2019","reviewText":"Love this thing.. so many uses and the wife loves it.

The speakers are the main reason i upgraded but I did not realize how much I would enjoy just asking Alexa to find me recipes and not having to print it out or get food particles all over my phone. Also with the use of some of the available apps and skills it can give you a TV where you didn't have one before. I used to not be able to see my TV while i was at the stove but now i can watch TV while I am Cooking.

I can’t speak for the video calling portion of the unit as I prefer to use my phone, but the screen itself seems nice enough.

The screen is much larger and brighter. The sound quality is a big leap up from the previous version. I would recommend adding the Amazon stand to your purchase.

We are old folk, a little resistant to change, and consequently never moved from standard cell to smartphone. The Echo, unfortunately, requires a smartphone application to enable calling from a contacts list. There is no accommodation to build a \"manual\" contacts list from which none smartphone users can make calls.

This device is much less reliable than my original Echo. I have used it for about six weeks now but its Bluetooth capability is much worse than the original echo. Sometimes it won't connect and the only way to reconnect is to unplug the power cord from the back of the Echo Show and plug it back in. At least that works, but it shouldn't have to be like this.

I have been trying for 2 weeks to sync all the devices in our home to no avail. I have Googled, called and emailed every resource I can find and have not found any assistance.

I'll give it a command and it'll ignore me, particularly when I'm listening to music.

Amazon music is a wonderful service that has obscure albums like Pablo Cruise Worlds Away from the 70's.

The workaround involved unplugging power from the device (but not the wall) and then restoring factory settings. I was told a software fix via update would be forthcoming, but after a recent power outage, I realized the problem still exists. If power at the outlet is interrupted or unplugged, I have to go through a factory reset again.

The only way to see photographs clearly was to view it straight on. Any movement to off-angle resulted in a washed out mess. The second gen is only slightly better in that regard to the first gen. It still has an annoying wash-out appearance when viewed off angle, but the angle appears to be a bit wider. This is likely due to the larger dimensions of the display, and not any change to the underlying display technology. For the display tech nerds out there, this is very likely an edge-lit TN type LCD (ie the worst of the worst for image quality) If you're expecting an IPS or OLED and would be disappointed with anything as low quality as a TN type then you might as well skip this device. The sound quality, however, is much better in my opinion. The base is deeper for sure. Because of the improved sound alone I decided to overlook the screen deficiencies and keep it.

Highly recommended. ;-)"},{"reviewerName":"Will Ewing","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Not sure why I love them, but I do.","reviewDate":"April 14, 2019","reviewText":"These gadgets have so much potential.

Probably a great product for the mobility impaired. However, it directs you to more Amazon products, more money for Amazon. Performs little free tasks other than turning on lights or inquiring about the weather. Save your money and look up the weather on your laptop,"},{"reviewerName":"Micah Arnold","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great sound and picture, but a little slow","reviewDate":"December 14, 2018","reviewText":"Amazing sound, although it's a tad bass heavy for my liking. It's very surprising how loud and clear this gets. I love the screen. It is vibrant and responsive. The OS itself seems to be slow, though, which is why I took one star away. It seems like it could be much faster than it is."},{"reviewerName":"Jbird","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Good improvements...","reviewDate":"October 22, 2018","reviewText":"I have many Alexa devices, and really liked the original show quite a bit. The addition of the video was such a huge improvement over the original devices. I had to try this new Show (2nd Gen) as my biggest concern with the original Show was that the screen was too small for kitchen/living room use. I like to check my schedule, weather, recipes, watch videos, etc. while cooking and it was originally a tad small for that from across the room. This new Show seems the perfect size for the kitchen. My only issue is that the speakers have moved from the front on the 1st gen (facing where you would be standing in front of the device) to the back of the 2nd gen Show. I have mine on the corner counter (8 inches from the wall) in the kitchen, and between being in the corner, and with cabinets above, it now sounds a bit like its muffled in a tunnel. I know some people originally complained because the 1st gen Show looked like a micro old projector TV, but that didn't bother me. In an effort to streamline and make the screen bigger, the speakers were moved to the rear. Just something to keep in mind when deciding where to place this device (and the reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars). I am happy with it, however, as the screen is a great size, crisp and a wonderful companion for the kitchen/living room!"},{"reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"highly recommend","reviewDate":"August 28, 2019","reviewText":"delivered in a timely fashion quality voice recognition is fantastic color is beautiful picture is fantastic"},{"reviewerName":"Tammy Burgess","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Easy setup!!","reviewDate":"August 1, 2019","reviewText":"Still getting acclimated with this item but setup was super easy and for what we have used it for so far, it has worked great!"},{"reviewerName":"Hank526","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Good product .","reviewDate":"August 26, 2019","reviewText":"I love this product it integrates well with my other echo products and I am able to video chat with my relatives in other cities that have the same device."},{"reviewerName":"Joseph La Torre Sr.","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Made very well the price was great love the big screen","reviewDate":"October 21, 2019","reviewText":"I love the big screen good quality Madewell works very well really love this product I would recommend it to everyone"},{"reviewerName":"Patty","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Techie son says, “Impressive.”","reviewDate":"June 3, 2019","reviewText":"Bought this for son’s birthday.

It seems to sense ambient light (or knows the time of day and operates from that) and adjusts the brightness. The problem is that it is not bright enough in low light making it hard to see. There should be a manual brightness adjustment available as well as an automatic mode.\n\nB. The clock is too small and impossible to read from a distance. The digital clock should have a multiple size option from current size to full screen. Also a twelve hour clock and an analog clock display would be nice.\n\nIn general, the Echo Show may have a number of display options, but I'm not sure they are really useful. Why watch a movie on the 10\" screen when the big TV with better quality video and sound is nearby. I do like the seven day weather display. One of the nicest features (also available on all Echo devices) is the \"drop in\" and \"announce\" feature turning all the Echos into an intercom system throughout the house.
