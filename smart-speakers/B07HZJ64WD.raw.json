I have used Amazon devices for around eight years now. I currently own three Kindle e-readers (Kindle Touch, Kindle Paperwhite 3rd generation, and Kindle 10). I also own four Amazon Fire tablets (2015 Fire 7 -5th generation, 2019 Fire 7 – 9th generation, 2017 Fire HD 8 - 7th generation and 2018 Fire HD 8 –8th generation) and 3 Echo devices (1st generation Echo, 2nd generation Echo Dot, and 3rd generation Echo Dot). Please note that I have traded-in some of the dated versions of the above-listed products to get upgraded versions (more on this under the “Saving Money on Purchases” section).\n\nThis device - Amazon’s Echo Show 5 (2019 release) is a refresh of the Echo Show line-up at an outstanding price. The Echo Show 5 (henceforth referred to as ES5) is in a new class of its own. The combination of quality and value are really tough to beat and the ES5 does well overall. This is a comprehensive review, but for those looking for the bottom line, scroll down to the bottom to see some feedback on how to save money on purchasing the Echo Show and my final recommendations. I honestly don’t know why this device is called Echo Show 5 when this is the third version (generation) of the Echo Show line-up. Some reviewers have suggested that this could allude to the device’s display size.\n\nI have spent the past few days interacting with the ES5, using it, and reading other online reviews about this device to ensure the comprehensiveness and accuracy of information provided in this review.\n\n- The Box (package): The Echo Show 5 (ES5) smart speaker, a quick-start guide, things to try card, 15W wall adapter, and a cable (4.9 foot). The item arrived sealed and packaged well.\n\n- Availability (Color): Charcoal and Sandstone. Option to also purchase this device with either color and a Ring Video Doorbell Pro at a higher price\n\n-Set up: Plug in the device to receive prompts, and then connect to the Internet. Overall, the set-up was self-explanatory.\n\n- Summary of critical aspects that have changed in this version: Echo Show 5 (ES5) vs. Echo Show 2 (ES2). Technically, there is nothing to compare this device to other than the previous Echo Show 2nd generation even though it is not a fair comparison because the previous device is a premium device. Perhaps, Amazon is trying to improve the number of offerings for its Echo Show line-up while decreasing the price and/or the Echo Show 2nd generation didn’t get as many sales (no clue, I am just guessing here). Please note that the Fire Tablets, the Kindles, and the Echo speakers have 3 models each so the above guess is a reasonable one.\n--- Release Date: ES5 (2019) vs. ES2 (2018)\n--- Display size: ES5 (5.5 inch) vs. ES2 (10.1 inch HD screen)\n--- Display resolution: ES5 (960 x 480 resolution) vs. ES2 (1280 x 960 resolution)\n--- Speakers: ES5 (one 4W speaker) vs. ES2 (two 10W drivers and a passive radiator with Dolby processing for room-filling sound)\n--- Camera: ES5 (1MP) vs. ES2 (5 MP)\n--- Camera Controls: ES5 (built-in camera shutter and microphone/camera off button) vs. ES2 (microphone/camera on/off button)\n--- Microphones: ES5 (2 mics) vs. ES5 (4 mics)\n--- Built-in Zigbee smart home hub: ES5 (NA) vs. ES2 (present)\n--- Dimensions: ES5 [5.8” x 3.4” x 2.9” (148mm x 86mm x 73mm)] vs. ES2 [9.7” x 6.9” x 4.2” (246 mm x 174 mm x 107 mm)].\n--- Weight: ES5 [14.5 oz (410 grams)] vs. ES2 [62.2 oz. (1765 grams)]\n--- Processor: ES5 (MediaTek MT 8163) vs. ES2 (Intel Atom x5-Z8350 processor)\n--- Adapter and cable: ES5 [Power adapter (15W)/cable (4.9 ft.)] vs. ES2 [Power adapter (30W)/cable (6 ft.)]\n\n- Key things are similar when compared to Echo Show 2nd generation device:\n--- Alexa is the same: However, please note that Alexa has several skills and is constantly being updated\n--- Basic functionality (i.e. the purpose the Echo Show device and uses) is the same\n--- Color options are the same.\n--- Warranty and Service options are the same\n--- Ports and buttons are the same\n\n- Comparison between the Echo Show 5 (ES5) and Echo Spot (ES)\n--- Release Date: ES5 (2019) vs. ES (2018)\n--- Display size: ES5 (5.5 inch) vs. ES (2.5 inc)\n--- Display resolution: ES5 (960 x 480 resolution) vs. ES (480 x 480 resolution)\n--- Camera: ES5 (1MP) vs. ES (VGA)\n--- Camera Controls: ES5 (built-in camera shutter and microphone/camera off button) vs. ES (microphone/camera on/off button).\n--- Microphones: ES5 (2 mics) vs. ES (4 mics)\n--- Built-in Zigbee smart home hub: ES5 (NA) vs. ES (present).\n--- Dimensions: ES5 [5.8” x 3.4” x 2.9” (148mm x 86mm x 73mm)] vs. ES [4.1” x 3.8” x 3.6” (104 mm x 97 mm x 91 mm)\n--- Weight: ES5 [14.5 oz (410 grams)] vs. ES [14.8 oz. (419 grams)]\n--- Adapter and cable: ES5 [Power adapter (15W)/cable (4.9 ft.)] vs. ES [Power adapter (W)/cable (6 ft.)]\n--- Color Options: ES5 (Charcoal or Sandstone) vs. ES (Black or White)\n\n- Key things are similar when compared to Echo Show 2nd generation device:\n--- Alexa is the same\n--- Basic functionality (i.e. the purpose the Echo Show device and uses) is the same\n--- Warranty and Service options are the same\n--- Ports and buttons are the same\n\n- Technical specs and other details (Echo Show 5):\n--- Size: 5.8” x 3.4” x 2.9” (148mm x 86mm x 73mm)\n--- Weight: 14.5 oz (410 grams)\n--- Warranty and Service: 1-year limited warranty and service included. Optional 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year extended warranty is available for U.S. customers and is sold separately.\n--- Wi-Fi connectivity: Dual-band Wi-Fi supports 802.11a/b/g/n/ac Wi-Fi networks. Does not support connecting to ad-hoc (or peer-to-peer) Wi-Fi networks.\n--- Ports: 3.5 mm stereo jack, power port, and USB port.\n--- Audio: Full range 1.65” built-in speaker. 3.5 mm stereo audio output for use with external speakers.\n--- Buttons on device: Two volume controls (Volume Up and Volume Down) and Camera Shutter (On/Off).\n\n- Some limitations (listed in order of concern) to be expected because of this device being sold at a bargain price and is the mid-tier model:\n--- There was some lag time in loading videos, some confusion to access things, and the screen doesn’t function similar to a tablet (swiping to access options and apps). Additionally, the software on this device occasionally kept freezing and navigation was a bit of a challenge. For instance, there were multiple times when the video I was watching reset to the beginning (after the video was paused and the home screen came on) and songs stopped mid-way. Consequently, I am docking down 1/2 a star.\n---The constant ads on the home screen (try Alexa to do something) can get a bit annoying. I am docking down 1/2 a star for this issue.\n--- FreeTime could not be enabled on this device. I tried repeatedly but couldn’t figure out how to make FreeTime work. Enabling Amazon FreeTime in the Alexa app can make any Echo Device kid-friendly. Again, I am docking down another 1/2 a star.\n--- The speaker is not as good as compared to the Echo Show 2nd generation\n--- No audio cable included\nTotal stars docked: 1.5\n\n- Some useful features on the Echo Show (not a comprehensive list).\n--- “Alexa has 80,000 skills and counting. Skills are like apps and help you do more like play Jeopardy! Just say, ‘Alexa, show me skills.’”\n--- Accessibility: “On Echo devices with screens, you can enable Alexa captioning and closed captioning, magnify the screen, toggle color inversion, and choose between color correction options. You can also enable the VoiceView screen reader to use gestures to navigate the screen and hear spoken feedback about the items you select.”\n--- Bluetooth: “Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP) support for audio streaming from your mobile device to Echo Show 5 or from Echo Show 5 to your Bluetooth speaker. Audio/Video Remote Control Profile (AVRCP) for voice control of connected mobile devices. Hands-free voice control is not supported for Mac OS X devices. Bluetooth speakers requiring PIN codes are not supported.”\n--- The “Drop In” feature on Alexa functions as a two-way intercom between any 2 Echo devices (needs to be enabled on receiver device). Additionally, customers can use Announcements as a one-way intercom to other household devices. This can be done by asking Alexa to “Drop In” on Kitchen, Kid’s bedroom, Living Room (depending on how you have named your Echo devices), etc. Family members do not need to accept Drop Ins (announcements) as compared to a hands-free call that needs to be accepted (similar to a traditional phone call, people can reject the call). Basically, the Drop In feature works in your house while the hands-free call feature (calls require that you input the contact name and phone number by letting the Alexa app access this information) is making a physical call to either someone in your home or somewhere else using the Echo device. Calls can be made to the U.S., Mexico, and Canada. Calling family members has been amazing. The noise-canceling set-up works really well and conversations are crisp and clear. Messaging option exists for those with the Alexa app, an echo device with a screen, or Skype.\n--- Ability to customize clock face, add background photos, entertain, and create morning routines.\n--- You can watch videos on WikiHow (unique new addition)\n--- There is a new and upgraded wake up alarm system (option to add ambient sunrise lighting feature)\n--- Surfing the web using Amazon’s web browser - Silk\n--- Other apps (games, educational tools, etc. available in Amazon’s app store) plus several prominent apps included like YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, etc.\n--- Ability to check email.\n--- Ability to control your smart home devices through voice control (security cameras, light, thermostats, etc.)\n--- Ability to watch movie trailers, news, see song lyrics, and album art\n--- Ability to listen to radio stations, podcasts, see song lyrics, and audiobooks\n--- Ability to create to-do lists, calendars, look at weather, and traffic. Also, you can receive step-by-step directions for cooking\n--- Customers can make purchases from their Amazon account\n\n-Some Usage Tips (Amazon’s review space limitations prevent me from putting any more tips):\n--- Changing Device Name: Please note that the device name can be changed from something generic to something specific. This is especially helpful if you own multiple Echo devices and was automatically assigned a generic device name (like “Echo Dot”) and has no clue which device is which on the Amazon Alexa app. This can be done by opening the Alexa app -> selecting “devices” -> selecting “All Devices”-> selecting “your respective device” -> then scroll down in your device options and select “Edit Name” -> Then you can change it to whatever you choose. Personally, I have named devices either based on user, model and/or location at home.\n--- Devices can be registered using the same methods listed above and getting to the Device specific page. This applies especially if you are gifting the device to another individual or are reselling it.\n\n- Potential best locations for device placement:\n--- Bedroom as an alarm clock and ambient device (slowly turns on in the morning), to see to-do lists, weather, news updates, wake up to music, play radio station, potentially seeing nursery (by using Alexa integrated nursery cameras) and also ability to control your smart home devices through voice control (security cameras, light, thermostats, etc.)\n--- Kitchen as a device to assist with cooking by providing step-by-step directions, to turn on music, etc.\n--- Home Office as a device to quickly check any updates (check the above list from bedroom).\n\n- Saving money on purchasing this device:\n--- Occasionally, Amazon also offers discounts for a bundle sale on products (get 2 or 3 items for a substantial discount). So, if you are considering buying the ES5, now is the time to order it. There is a limited time sale - you can get 2 devices for $30 off though I don’t know how long it will last.\n--- My recommendation would be to preorder this item now. If you don’t get a chance to do so, then you can purchase this item during a sale event (for instance, Amazon Prime day is in mid-July).\n--- The customer can get this item on sale during Prime day (based on prior sales analysis), and then stack the trade-in price (if you have an older device) and the 25% discount to get this item. However, one thing to keep in mind is that Amazon might decide to remove the trade-in gift card and 25% discount at any point.\n\n- Conclusion: 3.5/5 stars\nTo sum up my review, my slight frustration is that this device doesn’t exactly function as a stand-alone tablet nor does it function as a stand-alone speaker device so it can be a bit challenging to use initially. In my opinion, the Echo Show is a device still looking for its niche (i.e., in, many senses everything that the Echo Show 5 does, can be done better using dedicated devices like the Fire tablets, Kindle e-readers, or the Echo speakers). However, overall this device works really well in a small room. Updates worth noting in this version are the increased privacy options and lower cost. The bottom line is that if you are looking to get an affordable device that is well rated, has a small profile, is lightweight, and can function as a smart tablet, smart speaker, alarm, smart home devices controller, etc.(though not being good at anything per se plus being a bit challenging to use and have a few minor bugs) then this device is the way to go. I don't think this device deserves 4/5 stars. 4 is too high a score for this device as it has numerous flaws. 3 is too low a rating for this product as I think it is a good concept that requires much refining. However, Amazon doesn't give me the option to give a 3.5/5 or 7/10, but 3.5/5 is my final rating for this product.\n\nPlease note that several resources were used in the compilation of this review, but most of this review was based on my personal testing of the product. Additionally, because of the length of the review and some information fitting into multiple categories, I have repeated some key ideas to help customers unfamiliar with the device to get acclimated.\n\nWhenever I make any purchase, I try to do a thorough and accurate job with the review. This means that I am putting my trust in the global community of reviewers to assist me with finding the best choices for my family and self. My reviews are a way of giving back to the community, and I strive to be an ethical reviewer following the golden rule. Consequently, my reviews are my honest and comprehensive assessment of the product. I always post future updates and corrections based on new information if deemed necessary. Additionally, I always include photos of products to verify both that I purchased this product and to back up appropriate claims in the review. If you have any feedback or questions or corrections, leave a note in the comments section.

The constant large ads to “Try, Alexa [insert question or skill here]” that splash across the screen and cannot be turned off are annoying. Super annoying. Like return this annoying. There is no option to turn them off. You can only have *all of them play once then stop, but that means the content that you actually want regular updates of, like your stocks or news, scroll once and then never again. Oh, yeah, the photos of the product on this page? None of them show that “Try, Alexa” screen or card as they call it. So you have no idea that you will be constantly subjected to those screen filling ads all the time. This is not worth $90. It’s not worth $45. It’s an annoying ad machine. Oh and the screen is dark, low resolution so your photos look terrible, and there are only 2 video options (prime and nbc) but the software to select and watch them is terrible. This is a poorly conceived and executed product."},{"reviewerName":"Hernan","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"bad balance between promoting amazon services and providing value for the price","reviewDate":"July 1, 2019","reviewText":"having to disable cards as the only way to stop the rotating alexa suggestions is not really a sane option.\nconsidering the price of the device this should be easier to permanently disable instead of only being able to partially disable it (it will still show when interacting with the device) by disabling useful features.\n\nimagine going to the movies and seeing a banner at the bottom with \"we are also playing this other movie you might like\" and then 10 minutes later \"did you know you can buy popcorn?\" and then \"we have free restrooms\".

Cardone","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Better products are out there","reviewDate":"July 1, 2019","reviewText":"I have Google Home and Amazon Echo products in almost every room of my house. I love the connected home. My toys that let me control smart plugs and access my security cameras have tickled me pink.\n\nBut I've stayed away from Amazon screens because most of the professional reviewers have stated that you can do the same things with Amazon screen products that you can do with the Amazon tablets. Besides, over the 2018 holidays I picked up four Google Nest screens and I love them. Great pictures, videos, awesome view of my Ring and other security cameras.\n\nI purchased the Amazon Echo Show 5 in the \"buy two save $30\" sale thinking they wouldn't be too bad. When they finally arrived I unboxed one and was immediately disappointed at how small it was. Of course, I knew the size when I ordered them, but holding it my hand - it just looked tiny. After set up I realized the screen on the Echo Show 5 was smaller than my smartphone. So...immediate disappointment, let's see if it was still worth the adjusted $75 price.\n\nThe sound quality pleasantly surprised me. Just as good as the Echo speaker only. Sadly, that was the only positive I discovered after a week-end's use. The screen was too small to enjoy videos. I don't like the Amazon home screen and the number of screen tickers that run across the screen. I kept thinking it was trying to tell me something important. Instead, messages like, \"ask Alexa to tell you the time.\" kept popping up. Lame, man.\n\nAnyway, perhaps I was doomed to never like the Echo Show 5. I don't like that I'm locked out of the Android/Google environment with Amazon. When I ask Alexa to play \"Stacy's Mom\", I want to see Stacy's mom. And I don't want to have to do it through a browser like a neanderthal.\n\nI've attached two pictures to illustrate the size of the screen. Eh...If I had only purchased one for $75 I probably would have kept it instead of returning them both. But I honestly think this belongs at a $50 price. No higher. \"A smart alarm clock.\", some said. I agree.\n\nEDIT 7/17/19\n\nWell, two days after my $160 refund came through for the return of my original two ES5's came through and Amazon Prime Day happened. And they went down to $50 a piece. I didn't realize I had so much influence over Amazon pricing. Anyway, I repurchased two ES5's.\n\nI still think the unit is too small to be of any practical use. But, it's a toy for me and for $50 I'll splurge and mess around with them."},{"reviewerName":"Charles","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Can't disable \"Try, Alexa...\"; Terrible sound; worse than Echo Spot","reviewDate":"July 3, 2019","reviewText":"I got this hoping that it would resolve some of the problems with my old Echo Spot. It is worse in every way.\n\nWhen I took it out of the box, I immediately noticed that it feels much lighter than the Echo Spot. This is a bad sign since sound quality typically correlates to the heft of the magnet driving the speaker.\n\nIn every respect this is a cheap, buggy, poor quality version of the older Echo Spot:\n\n1. The sound is muddy and thumpy. I adjusted the bass all the way down and the midrange and treble all the way up, but it has only a minimal affect on the poor, muffled sound. It's not defective, just obviously a cheap, poor design.\n\n2. The timer still disappears. If I set a timer, I need to see it. Especially if the device is doing nothing else. What is the point of hiding the timer when that is all I've asked the thing to do? The Show 5 is worse, however, because the timer sound is not as loud and is muffled.\n\n3. Changing the volume cancels the timer. At least the Spot does not suffer from this \"feature.\"\n\n4. There is no way to disable the incessant \"Try, 'Alexa,…\" suggestions. They simply cannot be removed. And if you would like your screen to cycle through the weather and news headlines then you're going to have to cycle through the Amazon ads as well (where they \"suggest\" that you use Alexa to order things or check on shipping status).\n\n5. The microphone is still poor and unresponsive. I was hoping that this was one thing that could be fixed. My Apple HomePod can hear me halfway across the house with the TV going. If the Spot is playing the news or there is any other ambient sound I have to yell at it. Same with the Show 5. The microphone still makes it a struggle to be recognized if things are not library quiet.\n\n6, The is still no loudness equalization, Going beck to before the 1st iPod it's been easy to set things to normalize things to the same volume. With the Show 5, a low-volume news source is nearly inaudible while a high-volume source is too loud. When I have the Show 5 play three news sources I have to constantly adjust the volume between then. The old Spot has the same problem but you would have expected it to be fixed by now.\n\n7. There is still no option to configure how you want the home screen to look. The entire point of a bigger screen is to show more information, but this still has the old crude system of the Spot that just lets you select a few things that it will rotate through, including the Amazon ads about \"Try, 'Alexa,…\" I want weather, news headlines and time fixed on the screen. That's it but it cannot be done.\n\n8. There is no way to set the screen to big numbers. If you want to read time from a distance, or in bed if you are near sighted, you cannot fill the screen with the time.\n\nThe device is so hostile to its users that it's inconceivable that any real users were involved in its design and testing. It is completely and utterly disappointing."},{"reviewerName":"dfine1966","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Better than the Spot!","reviewDate":"July 1, 2019","reviewText":"My nightstand has a new companion, the Echo Show 5. I was using the spot, but because of the small screen size, I wanted a larger display that would do more. The Show 5 has done just that. From watching Youtube and Prime Video, to just having a clock. I like how much real-estate the screen has. I have the digital clock with the date and weather all on one page. I use my own photo's as its background. Overall I think it's an upgrade over the spot, which was moved to my office. If you want a new clock for your nightstand or something to play music or just to watch multiple sources of video, the Show 5 is for you.\n\nI see all these complaints about only having two sources of video, Prime Video and NBC. As I mentioned up above, Youtube is also available. You can access it through either of the two built in browsers (Firefox and Silk). It works very well.\n\nI guess each person has there own opinion of this product. It's not as bad as some of the reviewers on here are saying. I see me pictures clearly as they rotate on my Show 5. All I did was turn up the brightness. Amazon updates their software all the time. What might not be working now, could be fixed later.\n\nI bought this to use on my nightstand to replace the Spot.

It is light with a plastic screen giving a down-market feel, but at $40 less, I guess it is.\n\nSet up was fairly straight forward (on the device, not in the Alexa app) and then on to the tutorial.\nThe screen (while cheap looking/feeling as mentioned) is the size of a now standard smart phone in panoramic mode but with far fewer pixels. This gives it more functionality than the Spot, but it still feels “small” as a smart home device in a world of 5.7 plus inch phones. If you’ve ever had a Nucleus Intercom (which Amazon supported and then copied), you will be very familiar with the plastic feel/look of the Show 5.\n\nI took advantage of the buy two offer for the discount and then applied two more discounts after trading in a couple of Spots. Would I do it again? I am unsure. If buying a device new, the new Show 5 is a no brainer over the Spot (which will eventually go away), due to the better screen size, better speaker and significant price difference. If considering a trade in or trade up, definitely look for a discount or wait to see what Prime Day has to offer, as just the “feel” of the device will make you question your decision.\n\nAt this point, we are up to 14+ Alexa devices in our house/cars, so have gotten quite critical of every little device Amazon decides to roll out. But hey, what do I know? I’m a person who sent back two Gen 2 Echo Show’s and ordered refurbed 1st Gen Shows due to what I thought was a horrible bass sound from the new units.\n\nAgain, for a first time user or as an add on (not replacement), it can’t be beat at its price."},{"reviewerName":"R.F.

Once you get to Home Content, turn off EVERYTHING in that section. Just go down the list under Home Content and make sure that the slider for each item is not green (which means that it is turned on). After you do this, go back to your home screen, and your Echo Show 5 will be on whatever clock face you had previously chose/set up for it. Your Echo Show 5 home screen will continue to stay on that clock face, in the clock mode until you give it a command, or ask a question, etc. And after Alexa answers your question, your Echo Show will go right back to the home screen/clock mode once again.

Here is an excerpt from that email and I hope it helps others.\nYou can edit your home page to not show you certain things on the Echo Show 5:\n\n1. Go to settings\n2. Open Home & Clock\n3.

Baker","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Echo Show 5 vs Echo Spot (Used primarily as alarm clocks)","reviewDate":"July 5, 2019","reviewText":"My rating and review is focused on primarily alarm clock usage, with only occasional use to play music. If you're planning to use the Echo Show 5 for much more, this review may not be the most useful. If it's an alarm clock you're mostly interested in, read on...\n\nI bought the Echo Spot when it first came out. I loved (and still love) it. It was (mostly) perfect: high quality build, alarm face to fit my personal taste and decor, voice controlled (no more fumbling in the dark to set or turn off an alarm). But its biggest downfall, for me, was the size of the digital numbers, which I couldn't find a way to increase. My eyesight without glasses is walk-into-walls bad, so it was impossible to read from across the room and a challenge to read even from the bedside.\n\nEnter the Echo Show 5. All the same features I use on the Spot, but with big, clear numbers and still small enough to work on the nightstand.\n\nHere's the breakdown, from my perspective:\nSize: The Show, about the same height as the Spot but significantly wider, providing more screen space for a larger display. The Show is about the same size as my cell phone turned horizontally.\nBuild/materials quality: Show is good, but does not feel as solid as the Spot. Considering price difference (about $40 as of this writing), that's fair.\nStability: Show wins this one. The Spot is cute, but because of its shape it sometimes tips when you push it with one hand into a different location on your nightstand. Show is very stable.\nScreen quality: to my eyes (yes, with my glasses on), Spot is the clear winner. Sharper image.\nScreen layout: Show works better. Content has a little more space so appears less crowded.\nSpeakers/sound: Show wins. Speakers go around the sides and back and provide a pretty good sound. (Of course loses to a \"real\" speaker, like my Bose SoundLink.)\nPrivacy: Show has a built-in camera cover slide. Wasn't on the Spot (I bought a privacy sticky to cover the camera.)\n\nThe Spot is now in our second/guest bedroom and still a much-loved member of my Echo/Alexa family. The Show 5, while not as cute or made with as high quality materials, is my perfect alarm clock that occasionally plays me some music."},{"reviewerName":"Natalie Lewis","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"I’m not a paid Amazon employee, this is my honest opinion.","reviewDate":"July 3, 2019","reviewText":" I don’t usually rate items on amazon, but I’m disappointed in this Echo 5.

I might downgrade where the speakers, to me, were better.\nThe video is the volume turned up to ten!"},{"reviewerName":"gerald n","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"I feel like many of these reviews don't understand how to use this device...","reviewDate":"July 18, 2019","reviewText":"... and it's getting a bad rap because of those reviews. It seems that many of the \"most helpful\" reviews aren't actually helping since they are filled with bad information or wildly high expectations.\n\nOver and over, in the \"most helpful\" reviews, I read about \"ads\" displaying. This does NOT ever display ads, it displays Alexa skills and things to try with your device. I read that people cannot get that to stop happening. It's right in the settings: go to: ---Home & Clock--- then: ---Home Content--- then, turn off ---Discovery---, that will end the Alexa skills displaying (may cycle once after setting but then they're gone for good). I kept reading that people who want to use it as a clock were upset that the clock kept getting minimized (to left corner) to show other things. That's because, yet again, they aren't setting it up correctly. So, in the settings: go to: ---Home & Clock--- then: ---Home Content--- then, turn off ---Rotate Continuously---, that will make the Home screen always display a full screen clock. You can also just turn off any content in that list. Note that each time you go into the settings, immediately after, it WILL show you a single skill or any content you left on. But that's it. It will just be a clock from then on, until you interact with it again and then it may display a single skill or that content. Once. Then back to being a full time clock.\n\nFull disclosure: I got this to use as an alarm clock and not as a primary viewing assistant. For that, I recommend the larger echo devices. I also got this on Prime Day for $50 (rather than $90). That's a screaming good deal for what is basically a voice activated, smart alarm clock with a lot of different options.\n\nDecent Alarm clocks run $30-50 anyways so I thought I'd give this device a try for $50. I should have bought 2. Even for $90, I feel like this is a great device but if you wait, it will eventually go on sale again. I don't intend to use it to watch TV shows or movies, I have TVs, tablets and PCs for that. I saw people mentioning being disappointed in the resolution or screen quality. I don't see the problem. This certainly isn't going to compare to your $300-800 smart phone screen but it's not bad looking when playing videos or displaying the clock. It's similar to say, an iPhone 3 or Galaxy S2. I feel like the people complaining are expecting \"the moon\" for the money this costs. It's $90. Not $150 or $200.\n\nJust wanted to clear that up as it seems to be discouraging users from buying it as a clock/alarm clock. I feel like Amazon could make that more clear since this seems to get used for an alarm clock (or clock) pretty frequently. The included instructions are not comprehensive either. It's basically a \"get started\" card. They probably should include a \"how to get the best clock experience\" how-to.\n\nStuff I really like: I think it is pretty cool that I can watch the daily news briefing on my alarm clock. I can get the weather for today or the week's forecast displayed. I can play music with decent sound (much better than most clocks sound) on my alarm clock. It displays the date and weather information in the top left corner and alarm time in the top right. All of that is voice activated. I can also use my voice to set the alarm (and turn it off) rather than fiddling with 3-4 buttons, or holding one down while it cycles through 24 hours. You can also manually set it in the settings with the touch screen. The alarm sound can also be set to come on quietly and gradually increase in volume. It also sets it's own time automatically. It's great to have one less clock to reset (or swap batteries). The screen can automatically dim at night or you can just manually set a time-frame to do so. The camera has an actual shutter for privacy ( in addition to the button that shuts it and the mic off).\n\nThe downside to using this as an alarm clock is if the power goes out, you get nothing. There is no battery backup. If you live in an area where that happens frequently, you may want a back-up alarm (like, say, your phone) or just avoid getting this unit altogether. Aside from that, I really can't find anything to nitpick about it.\n\nThis is a pretty solid little device. It looks good, it feels like the build quality is solid and it isn't enormous. It isn't as nice as the full size Echo Shows in content, screen quality and sound quality (I bought Mom an Echo Show, I have many dots), but it's a nice middle ground between those full sized units and the echo dot. I feel like that's what amazon was aiming for and they nailed it. It's exactly what I'd hoped it would be. It's a fantastic alarm clock.\n.\n.\n.\nNote: The micro USB port in the back is for hooking up Ethernet (wired internet) using an Ethernet adapter. This won't be necessary or useful for most people but if you are getting poor WiFi signal, it's nice to have that available. (I had to research that as I couldn't figure out what the point of that port was).\n\n...I will update review if it becomes a problematic alarm clock."},{"reviewerName":"D","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Doesn't interact with their technology already in place","reviewDate":"July 4, 2019","reviewText":"When Amazon releases a product that doesn't interact with their technology already in place, it is never good!

When I got it it shows the large display briefly then the time shrinks up into the corner and is not legible across the room which is what I bought it for. I tried everything I can think of and it still shrinks up into the corner and prompts me to try different skills etc. which are all things I have no interest in. I wanted a smart alarm clock which could tell me what was on my schedule when I woke up. As it is it is nearly useless. Finally managed a partial work around. Let the display cycle until it's large again then command \"Alexa Stop!\" The clock still keeps counting, but the banners and other info stops scrolling which is what I wanted. I found it doesn't have its own internal calendar, but relies on Cloud apps which is not what I wanted. I don't particularly need Google to know when I have an eye exam.\n\nEdit... Upgraded my rating from a 1 to a 3 star. Probably would give it a 3.5. I was contacted by Amazon support and got some work arounds. One problem is it had only a \"Quick Start Guide,\"included in the box which allowed me to get it plugged in and connected to my home Wi-Fi router. After that there were no instructions. I queried Alexa for a long time and got mostly \"I don't know how to do that!\" responses. I needed a set of instructions about basic functions of which it is capable, and specifically how to access them. I think the developers all know how to use it because they wrote the software. I, on the other hand, do not. I don't want to spend a great amount of time exploring (and getting lost) before I discover what I want. As it is, it's working, but I still have to frequently tell it \"Alexa Stop!\" to get it to stay on the large numeral display I want."},{"reviewerName":"jodeg","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Love My Echo Show 5!","reviewDate":"July 1, 2019","reviewText":"We have the large Echo, 4 Echo Dots, an Echo Spot, and now the Echo Show 5 -- I love them all!

The Echo Spot 5 is a real disappointment.\n\nFirst and foremost, I wanted an excellent bedside clock .. not too much to ask, is it? The Echo Show 5 has surprisingly few options for clock styles and faces, and no independent controls for color, contrast, and brightness. \"Night Mode\" was a good effort, but it is way too dim for me. And trying to adjust device brightness to yield acceptable daytime brightness and readable nighttime is frustrating. I've yet to produce a time display that can compete with a $5 alarm clock.\n\nSecondly, the marketing people with their \"Things to try\" is extremely annoying. You cannot turn this off. It competes for screen real estate and clutters the user experience. It is insane to have \"Try 'Alexa, show me Sneaky Pete'\" competing with my important reminders and alerts.\n\nThere are other minor issues I could live with (e.g. screen touch response is iffy) and some bugs I'm sure will be worked out (mine won't play my flash briefing most of the time, at a time other Alexa devices have no issue). But the two items above are showstoppers for me."},{"reviewerName":"K. F.","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Disappointing","reviewDate":"July 1, 2019","reviewText":"The new Echo Show 5 is to the Echo Show what the Echo Dot is to the Echo - a smaller, cheaper version targeted at a wider consumer audience. It's a good idea on paper, but software and hardware issues make it fall a bit flat.\n\nIt should not be a big surprise for the price, but the image quality on the touch screen isn't great. You get somewhat dull color and a bit of fuzziness from the relatively low pixel density, although if you're more than 18 inches away you won't notice the fuzziness. The screen gets surprisingly warm, which suggests inefficient components and wasted electricity. The screen is always on; I think it dims itself if it hasn't heard any noise nearby in a while, though I'm not completely certain yet as I'm usually near by.\n\nThe speaker characteristics are... interesting. Bass is much better than any generation of the Echo Dot, but mids and highs are a bit muddy. You can improve this with the equalizer but not fix it completely. Softer music such as acoustic, folk, and classical tend to sound pretty good; sometimes a bit better than the Echo Dot gen 3, sometimes worse. However, harder music such as rock or metal does not do well on the Echo Show 5. The speaker can't handle the more complex sound, and the music becomes distorted and muddy. Punching up the volume just makes things worse. At maximum volume, the severely distorted audio is like the speaker screaming for mercy.\n\nThe operating system is a simplified version of what you see on a Fire tablet. The UI is not particularly fast or responsive, but it is certainly handy being able to adjust the device's settings on the Echo Show 5's screen instead of having to pull out your phone. By default, the home screen will try to promote various products and services, but you can turn this off. Unfortunately, there's one major thing about the Echo Show 5's OS that really bugs me: at the bottom of almost every screen are annoying tips about how to use Alexa, e.g. 'Try \"Alexa, play Alicia Keys music videos\"'. You can't turn this off! I contacted Amazon support about it and they said there currently is no option to disable these annoying tips, so you're stuck with them all over the OS.\n\nThere seems to be some kind of problem with the device's setup procedure. When you first plug in the Echo Show 5, it will spend ten minutes or so repeatedly rebooting and showing progress screens. If it's installing updates, this is not made clear from the screens. After completing device setup, it spent another ten minutes rebooting. Worse, if I unplug it and plug it back it, it goes through another round of this ten minute rebooting process, though at least I don't have to go through device setup again."},{"reviewerName":"Pierce","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great Economy AI, Touch Screen Makes it a Real Winner","reviewDate":"July 1, 2019","reviewText":"Update 2: In hotels the last two weeks, this a great travel companion.

If you want an actual bedside clock and don't need alexa, check out lenovo.\n\nREVIEW:\nI had really high hopes for this. We have a mixed smart home ecosystem featuring both of the competing assistants. I always felt Alexa handled smart home command a bit better. We have a Ring doorbell so we though this would be perfect. Really its only an upragded dot soundwise and a screen for our doorbell.\n\nThe \"things to try\" advertising which has no place on a clock makes the clock annoyingly unusable at times. Its early and you glance over half asleep hoping to see the time, but alas it's not there, but a suggestion is, and not like it switches back fast. You're already awake by the time it switches back or you squint to notice the small clock in the corner of the 5 inch screen. Changing a setting turning off cards (read no news etc) makes it happen less often, but when it does switch, it also randomly makes the screen go black for a second then back to a clock.\n\nIt is so frustrating that they cant get the mics to hear better. When you give a command sometimes it's sluggish as it displays on the screen and you almost think its gonna freeze. Once you do anything you almost always have to ask for it to go back to the clock unless you want to wait a minute or few before it finally leaves the screen (example \"turn in porch light\" swaps to a porch light screen flipped to on that just sits there. I look back and i realize I need to then say \"alexa show clock\")\n\nI got a new lenovo smart clock at the same time and that thing hears better than anything in my house, like over other devices im next to, has a great light sensor and not as good but decent better than home hub sound.\n\nMy home hub is even better screen/lifht sensor wise although less clocky and less bedside sized and does not have as good sound."},{"reviewerName":"Tom Hoots","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING ME??","reviewDate":"July 21, 2019","reviewText":"UPDATE - 10/20/2019: I AM GOING TO TOSS THIS WORTHLESS PIECE OF JUNK INTO THE GARBAGE. Actually, I'm debating over whether to just toss it into the dumpster, or to set up a video I could take wherein I will bash this piece of junk into a million pieces with a sledge hammer, and share it with \"the Amazon community.\" ALL I WANT IS A FREAKING CLOCK THAT SHOWS THE OUTDOOR TEMPERATURE -- any link to one of the usual online weather sites will provide a temperature that's close enough for me. And, occasionally, this thing will show that to me. However, a few weekends ago, it utterly would not show the clock. Over the following week, it appeared that Amazon had \"fixed something,\" and the clock showed properly again. But this weekend, my carefully-chosen color scheme (a simple blue background with white characters) was gone, replaced by a hideous black background with orange digits. Is this Amazon's way of \"sharing the Halloween season\" with me? WELL, WHERE IS THE \"TURN ALL OF THE AMAZON BULL---- OFF\" SETTING, SO I CAN MAKE THIS THING DO WHAT =I= WANT IT TO DO, INSTEAD OF AMAZON DECIDING WHAT TO DO WITH IT???? Of course, there is no such thing, and the way Amazon \"works,\" THERE NEVER WILL BE ANY SUCH THING. That's it -- I'm done. Not just with the Echo Show 5, but for any \"Amazon connected\" product. There is no way in ---- that I'm going to let Amazon or anyone else decide what some device in my home will or will not do. FOR CRYING OUT LOUD, how difficult can it possibly be to just LEAVE ME THE HECK ALONE, or to include some kind of setting to \"not allow Amazon to change the screen layout\" and so on? I'll replace this piece of crap with a simple clock that will show me the time, and be done with it. THIS WAS A MASSIVE, MISERABLE MISTAKE. And make absolutely no mistake about it, people: YOU DO NOT CONTROL THIS DEVICE. AMAZON DOES.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nUPDATE - 9/30/2019: Well, I kept the relatively useless thing. The alarm setting is so nonsensical that I have never, ever used this as an \"alarm\" clock. But over the weekend, apparently Amazon has screwed up its servers or something, and now THE THING WON'T EVEN WORK AS A \"CLOCK.\" Nope, I absolutely cannot get it to show a simple \"clock\" face for more than a minute or two, and then it wanders off and shows something else. I have reached out on a customer forum, and apparently this has been happening to plenty of other folks. BEWARE, PEOPLE: This thing is controlled by Amazon. IT IS NOT CONTROLLED BY YOU. Amazon does not give you the controls, or the power, to make it do what YOU want it to do. It will only do what AMAZON decides it shall do. So, useless as an \"alarm\" clock, and now useless as a \"clock.\" I'm unplugging it and throwing it into the dumpster right after submitting this.

I SURE AS HECK DON'T WANT TO WAKE UP THAT EARLY ON ANY OTHER DAYS. Gosh golly gee, you might think that with this INTERNET-ENABLED, VOICE-CONTROLLED, NINETY DOLLAR PAPERWEIGHT, you could control alarms with pin-point precision, with any setup configuration you could POSSIBLY CONJURE UP, right?\n\nFOR CRYING OUT FREAKING LOUD.\n\nHeck, YOU CAN'T EVEN CHOOSE TO REPEAT AN ALARM ON ANY GIVEN DAY OF THE WEEK, at least via the device, or via the \"Alexa app\" they want you to use. THERE ISN'T EVEN THIS SIMPLE OPTION, ANYWHERE WITHIN EITHER OF THOSE MEANS OF \"CONTROLLING\" THIS WORTHLESS PILE OF GARBAGE. However, you CAN go to an \"Alexa\" web page, and finally, find an option to choose ONE day of the week for an alarm. Oh, but I want the alarm to go off on THREE different days. No problem, right?\n\nNOT WITH THIS NINETY-DOLLAR WORTHLESS PILE OF GARBAGE! After stumbling around to find ANY means of assigning an alarm to a day of the week, only to find it on some web page THAT MIGHT NOT BE AROUND THE NEXT TIME YOU WANT TO USE IT, you will find that, no, you can't assign it to multiple days of the week.\n\nOK, fine.

I could have purchased 4 shows for the price of thee Spots if it had been available (wife likes the spot best). I like them as security cameras to simply say \"Alexa, drop in on Living Room, Kitchen or Bedroom and have it just pop up on the screen from anywhere in the US or around the world where there is wifi is pretty darn cool. Now that we have Astro Bob as the new mount for the Spot, the boys (4 and 6) will entertain themselves watching Sponge Bob and others or asking if for answers about things they just happen to think up, and laughing wildly when it does not know. The only issue I have with the Dot the Spot or the Show is the search engine. If it gets it wrong the first time, dont ask a different way a second time -- you will get the same answer t ways and get the same answer or HMMM I dont know that, and I will ask Siri (iphone) and get much better results. I think its because it uses Bing as a search engine which has always been a huge disappointment and never got any better. Lose the Bing and get a search engine with some Bang in the search engine. That said, they are still pretty hand for many things I found out after we purchased the Spot. And very useful for Amazon searches. The wife and I have answered question of the day now 63 days in a row (you can do this anywhere too) and though we get them wrong sometimes, its still a great way to stimulate the brain and get some interesting discussions going or some friendly ribbing when one of us does not consult the other and gives the wrong answer because we KNEW that one, but did not. There are probably several thousand uses for this, and we have only scratched the surface. The other day, I thought I might like some banana bread (I cant cook) so I asked Echo for a recipe for banana bread - popped right up with a short video and complete measurements.

So, thought adding a screen would give me more. However, there are not many capabilities added and those that are, fail to convince. The ads are indeed annoying, and while you can turn them off, you have to turn off all cycling info, like stocks, sports, etc. Stocks, nice idea. However, try adding some stocks and you will get mad. Alexa does not understand more than very few stocks and would also fail to add them several times. Playing music from Apple music works, however again full of limitations. Try to play a playlist and not start at the beginning, not possible. Skipping multiple songs, not possible. Playing a full album, sometimes not understood. Ask for traffic to work, no map shown, only tells you time which is not too helpful as you might want to explore alternative routes. Weather only for one location shown and not very accurate. Would like to be able to switch to other providers. Overall, I am pretty much disappointed. Most things could be addressed by software, so I hope Amazon will work hard to make this a useful device.

It does work with Ring and Wyze skills so I can see my camera feeds within 5-20 seconds loading time\n\nCons:\n- The new feature for smart home control takes forever to load. After I hit the smart home option, I can take my phone out of my pocket, open the hue app and control the lights and it still won’t have loaded on the echo\n- The speakers sound extremely muffled but I’ve read blogger reviews that the speakers sound great so I don’t know if both of mine are defective or the bloggers are delusional\n- the microphones seem to get worse and worse with every echo product I get. I started with 2nd gen echo dot. Then got a 3rd gen where they reduced the number of mics and all of a sudden it couldn’t understand me 10% of the time. Now with this echo show, it seems like 20% of the time it does something random\n- it has stupid Alexa command suggestions that have been there since the first echo show and I don’t understand why Amazon hasn’t removed them after all the complaints. It will say something like “try ‘Alexa set a timer’” below every page on the home screen that isn’t the clock screen. On the original echo (and maybe echo 2) it would show it even on the clock screen so I guess there is a slight improvement here but not enough\n- the final issue that applies to all echo shows is dimming the photo slideshow. Presumably it does this to make all the white text easier to read but I wish it had some kind of auto adapting font like on phones where it will turn the text black or white depending on the necessary contrast for your home screen / lock screen without dimming the photo.

Winton","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Better than the first Echo Show, but still some obvious flaws","reviewDate":"July 2, 2019","reviewText":"I pretty much blasted the first version of the Echo Show for its rather appalling shortcomings (and returned it as a result). I decided to take a stab at the Show 5 because of its favorable price point versus its Show 2 big brother and the twofer package deal Amazon offered to promote interest in the device. I also assumed that Amazon had addressed many of the issues I had with the first version of the Show line, and that has indeed proven to be the case. You may remember the Chumby and its successor the Sony Dash (now long gone), at one time dubbed the world's most expensive bedside alarm clock. This version of the Echo Show is similar, not only in size and appearance, but in having a clock based splash screen. In other words this is not a new idea, but it does have the considerable advantage of integrating a number of smart home capabilities as well as a camera. I have a large number of TP-Link devices, a security camera, and a Ring doorbell, all of which work equally well with the Show 5 as other Alexa devices, but in this case with both voice and touch control. I did have some difficulty getting my Ring doorbell to work with the Show 5, but fixed the problem by re-enabling it using the Ring app on my cell phone, followed by using device discovery on the Alexa app. I think the problem was due to having upgraded the Ring, which had continued to work without doing anything with the app. Full Ring capability has been promised for the Show series, but apparently is still a work in progress, since I can't look at history on the Show 5. I believe two-way audio does work now, although I haven't tested it. Anyway, the ability to handle smart home devices works transparently, and checking a camera by voice command is a real plus compared to bringing the display up on a cell phone or computer.\n\nI found it disappointing that Amazon has still not endowed the Show series with such a fundamental capability as the ability to display Kindle book text. Mind you, the Show 5 will read Kindle content out loud, just not show it. Why? You can ask for recipes (e.g., \"alexa, recipe for deviled eggs\"), which will yield a large selection from the web (also showing ratings) where you can scroll and/or step through a selected recipe, either by touch or voice, pretty nice if your fingers are greasy. If you have a Kindle cook book, note you are out of luck for using this feature to display its recipes. The 5.5\" screen at 960 x 480 resolution is about on par with cell phones of a few years back, not great resolution, but effective enough given its size. At that resolution I wouldn't use it to watch movies or expect much from photos. The Show 5 has a 1 Meg camera, pretty much a match for the screen resolution. Since the camera might give some people pause for siting the device in a bedroom, Amazon has thoughtfully provided a (physical) slider that covers the camera lens. There is also a button that turns both camera and mic off. In the same vein, the Show 5 has an ambient light sensor to significantly dim the display at night in keeping with using its clock functionality in a bedroom.\n\nThe sound system has only a single speaker, but does surprisingly well for such a small device. You also have bluetooth and aux out if you want more sound (or stereo). Also on the plus side I was able to access my Amazon playlists and get to the internet via one of the integrated Silk or Firefox browsers (\"alexa, open silk\" or \"alexa, open firefox\"), both of which are built in. One minus other reviews cite seems to have already been taken care of in the latest update, since I was able to use settings to have a clock display that doesn't cycle to show other things. My display now holds as a clock face with day, date, and outside temp. If you want more weather detail, \"alexa, show weather\" will give you hour by hour conditions. Showing a radar map requires using a separate (free) app, which to make Alexa aware you go to the Amazon web site and press a button to enable it. I should note the radar map downloaded is a (current) regional radar snap shot based on your location and is not zoomable, which makes it pretty weak given the lack of screen resolution.\n\nOther than the inability to show Kindle text, I'm happy with the device. The price point is good, significantly better than the Google Nest (although each device has features the other lacks; the Nest has a larger screen, the Show 5 a camera). I wouldn't call it a 5-star effort on Amazon's part yet, but it is certainly worthy of a 4-star rating as delivered."},{"reviewerName":"AH","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Early adopter review.

The latest form factor for Amazon power bricks is a bit big & square with a hardwired pigtail that means they cannot be extended and the power brick itself is a bit of a large brick. However this is probably due to a universal form factor requirement to allow the power plug prongs for different countries to fit into the same brick. It works but... one good thing is no. Ore usb plug sticking out the front making it ridiculously deep and stick out from the wall too much.\nShow unit: I plugged it in and the very first thing it did after I connected it to the internet was download new software.

It took about 10 minutes overall but nothing hiccuped and it went just fine from there.\nIt has a pretty good screen resolution, I use it to view my Ring doorbell and it does that nicely, so resolution is sufficient. I cannot see anyone happily watching any videos for any length of time on it as it is just too small for that really.\nI am still playing with the settings, I have it showing a clock and the weather, although the weather is a bit more primitive than I expected, it just shows temperature and a cloud or sun symbol, I was hoping for a bit more and maybe to access a weathe r radar app, but I need to do more app research (any hints anyone?)\nThe Alexa app is disappointingly basic for using to set the device settings, I thought it Luis be much more comprehensive, but you have to do almost all of it in the device, which as a bit of a lag on the touch screen. This I am sure can be improved with future software updates though.\nOverall it is what I expected, I have not reached its full potential yet and need to delve deeper into its settings and options, but as a simple bedside device it works pretty well.\nI hope I will be able to learn more about what I can get it to do.\nIf you get one you will probably not be disappointed, just don’t expect it to do everything that a smartphone or tablet can do and you will be happy."},{"reviewerName":"Botanical SA","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"A great new addition to our home’s Smart gadgets.","reviewDate":"June 29, 2019","reviewText":"Our new sandstone color Echo Show arrived yesterday.

Video calls can be made on it so we are thinking that at Holiday times it might be fun to share our kitchen gatherings with other family/friends?\nThere is a port on the back for adding speakers.

The photo was taken by one employee as they set up and used the Echo Show 5. These are ok I guess for things like using as a high dollar clock or for other Amazon Alexa things, but they work very poorly for video chatting. If you look at his photo, the woman in the main window is using a ten inch Echo device. The other employee is in the upper-right corner using the Echo 5. He's sitting right in front of it, but it makes him look like he's sitting on the side because the video camera is in the upper-right of the device, and not in the middle above the screen as it is on the ten inch Echo.\n\nThe employee who has the ten inch model is always centered. We have relatives who use the round one (Spot) and it has the camera in the middle too, so they are centered. But the Echo 5 is always going to show you to one side. Might be ok if there are always 2-3 of you in the video as it would balance out then, but it's really odd because he said you have to turn the whole thing to the side so you're in the middle to the other person. But then you have to look at a turned Echo 5 so you look normally centered to THEM (if that makes sense). You would think between design and making it out to sales someone would have picked up on this? Anyway, if you have other uses for it there are no glaring bad marks, but since they do advertise it for video chatting, and that was our main purpose in buying these and it's done so poorly, I have to give it bad marks."},{"reviewerName":"Bee","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"1st one didnt work.

It was incredibly easy to connect to my wifi, setup, and personalize with my own photos. You have options on selecting the clock face. Whole process took about 40 minutes. Be prepared to input your wifi password, and answer a few questions to complete setup. The speakers are rich....as good as the Echo (2nd gen) in my living room. It does everything a normal Echo product does (tells me jokes, answers questions, controls my connected smart devices, etc.). I used to have to shout at Alexa to turn off lights in the house from bed, but no more. I can speak softly to this little gem and I'm fast asleep. I absolutely LOVE that this has a \"night mode\" that softens the clock face at night so the light doesn't keep you up. It also is has a \"smart light\" that brightens about 15 minutes before an alarm goes off. Apparently, this only works during the morning hours. I seriously have zero complaints about this device. I bought the stand primarily to keep the fabric off the tabletop since I'm not the best at remembering to dust and I didn't want the fabric getting dust bunnies. The stand connects with a magnet and is quite secure. I think it gives it a sort of mid-century Jetson's look that I like. The biggest plus of this product is it has substantially reduced those \"Damnit, I have to get up again to turn off the lights/turn down the thermostat.

But we kept a classic digital clock around for exactly one reason - waking up in the middle of the night and not knowing what time it is (you don't ask Alexa at 3am and wake up your partner). So I was thrilled to get the Echo Show 5 which is literally designed for exactly this combination. Plus it can now show me the weather, sports scores, and pictures of my kids. Awesome. Sold.\n\nThere's exactly one feature, though, which annoys me because I think Amazon is not showing proper respect to its audience. It is the \"Things to Try\" feature. The device will always - always - be showing \"Try saying Alexa, tell me the weather\", \"Try saying Alexa, tell me a joke\", \"Try saying Alexa, how many ounces in a pound...\" You're going to want the display on all the time, and you're probably going to have it rotate through things like sports scores, and showing your pictures. Well, \"Things To Try\" is always going to be there.\n\nWhy do I hate it? Because I have 5 Echo devices. I'm a software developer and I've got several skills published in the store. I do NOT need to be told, constantly, what things I can try. By baking this feature into the new device and making it front and center, Amazon's basically said, \"We assume that the only people who will have this device are brand new to Alexa.\" I find it annoying that once a company like Amazon has your money, they stop caring about you and just pay attention to the new customers. There's advanced users who would prefer a finer degree of control over their device. Maybe some more customization features - better alarms, backgrounds...

I haven't used it long, so that opinion may change. The biggest thing I like is the ability to use Ethernet instead of WiFI. I plan to replace my regular Echo by my bed. The less RF while I sleep the better. For the people wondering, the micro USB port DOES function for an Ethernet adapter.\nI bought the ES5 and personally tested it. I tried 4 different USB Ethernet adapters and only one worked. The one that worked has a Realtek chipset (supposedly RTL8153) inside. When connected to my PC all I could find was \"Realtek GBE\". It came from Amazon and was branded Cable Creation. It was a USB 3.0 to gigabit adapter. If you search B01FJQGCB0 on Amazon you should find it.\nThe other adapters (all USB 2.0) didn't work. I tried a Plugable brand fast Ethernet (100mbps), a Plugable brand Gigabit (1000mbps) and the official Chromecast Ethernet adapter. The Plugable brand adapters both had ASIX brand chipsets. I don't know what the Chromecast one had. None of those worked. Besides the Ethernet adapter, you will need a \"Y\" OTG cable (one that has a power input) and a micro USB charger/power cord from an old phone or something.\nThe micro USB port on the ES5 does NOT output power, so the power for the Ethernet adapter comes from the power input on the OTG \"Y\" cable. My ES5 was a brand new one, that I deregistered (after shipment) from my Amazon account, prior to the first powering on. The new Amazon devices I have received lately have been pre-setup with my personal WiFi login info, which I didn't want the ES5 to have available to it, so it would HAVE to use Ethernet. Deregistering wipes the WIFI info.\nI connected everything and powered it on. It picked up the \"wired\" connection right away and setup began. If the Ethernet adapter gets unplugged and plugged in again, the Echo Show 5 doesn't seem to pick it back up, without first power cycling the ES5. So when you first connect everything, make sure to power cycle your ES5. With those pieces, anyone should be able to figure out how to connect them.\nI did NOT try the official Fire TV Ethernet adapter, but would expect it to work. Something to note about that, I believe the Fire TV Ethernet adapter is only fast Ethernet (100mbps) where as the adapter I used is gigabit (1000mbps) though you will only get about 200mbps through the micro USB port (USB 2.0 bus). That assumes the ES5 is even fast enough to use more than 100mbps."},{"reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","rating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"No Hulu Support","reviewDate":"July 6, 2019","reviewText":"My daughter wanted this device as an award for six months of hard work... she is disappointed that there is no Hulu support.

I would expect anyone buying one of these would have read the Professional Reviews from CNET, etc. and been aware of what they call serious negatives.\n\nFor example, the Show 5 has a 5.5” screen with 960 x 480 resolution. Marking it down because you can't watch HD movies on it doesn't make sense. While you can watch movies/videos on it, clearly it isn't designed to be a primary HD video device and if you couldn't figure that out before you bought it, that's on you, not the device.\n\nSame with the complaints about the sound. Pro reviews say the audio sounds to be better than the Echo Dot 2/3 Gen and not as good as the larger Echo Show. You should not expect or be disappointed that the sound isn't Bose quality.\n\nDon't lower the score because it isn't battery operated either. If you didn't realize that before you bought then you obviously don't know how to read item descriptions. You really want a battery operated, high quality, HD screen on a small screen device that you can carry around in your hand - get a Razer phone.\n\nI will agree that the \"ads\" or \"Try asking Alexa this...\" is a little bothersome but I don't sit for hours watching the Home screen, so really it is a very minor nuisance and again not something to warrant a multi-star deduction from a review.\n\nNow that I'm done ranting, overall the Echo Show 5 works well as either the \"clock in the bedroom\" Echo device and maybe the \"Menu screen in the kitchen\" Echo device although maybe in the kitchen you'll want a larger screen.

Originally, I bought the Show 5 to control my bedroom smart plugs and check the weather in the morning. After seeing the Show 5 in person I plan on keeping it on my nightstand because size wise it feels like a better fit than my large dresser. All that comes in the box is the Show 5, a standard Amazon power cable similar to the one that came with my Echo Dot, and some quick star guides. The Show 5 was easy to set up but a bit longer than expected because of a software update. It even plays a video of how to get started! It’s very lightweight and has a large rubber bottom to keep it from sliding around when touching the screen.\n\nIt picks up my voice very well, even from across the room. When you say the wake word, “Alexa,” there’s a blue line at appears on the bottom of the screen and it moves in the direction she things your voice is coming from. Swiping down from the top edge of the screen gives you access to the home button (which is the quickest way to get back to the home screen unless you say “Alexa go to the home screen.” It would of been nice to have a physical home button on top), brightness, Do Not Disturb and Settings. The settings are for things like the clock face( which there’s a lot to choose from so you can defiantly have fun customizing it to your liking), device options, and more. Swiping left from the right side edge of the screen will reveal more Alexa familiar settings like Routines, Alarms, Smart Home, and more.\n\nThe screen is very sharp and the colors all look good! I don’t know about using it in the kitchen for a recipe, maybe leave that to the larger Show. The devices’ size no larger than that of a portable bluetooth speaker, which for some reason I expected to be slightly larger but it’s a great size! Speaking of speakers, it has an aux port in the back to plug in external speakers although I found the built in speaker to work just fine. The sound is loud and can definitely fill a room with ease. I really enjoy that she provides a visual to go along with the voice command. For instance with weather she’ll show a slideshow of the current high/low, hourly forecast, wind, etc.\n\nThe light sensor on the front is nice so it can automatically adjust the display brightness based on the rooms brightness. It has a Dark Mode so in a darkened room the screen brightness basically goes all the way down. Although if you’re someone who needs to sleep in complete darkness this might be an issue. I noticed even at the lowest brightness it was still too bright for me to sleep and I figured out by saying “Alexa, turn the screen off” is the only way to make the screen black. I wish it was built into the Routine settings for me to add “screen turns off” during my goodnight routine, but maybe that’ll come in a future software fix.\n\nThe overall design is very visually pleasing. The fabric on the back is a nice modern touch and the front is glossy (would of been nice if it was a matte finish to reduce glare and fingerprints) so it’ll have to be cleaned often. I’m not upset at the size of the bezels although it would of been nice if they were a little slimmer. I have the Charcoal color and the camera cover is white which is a little strange because it stands out as a white dot in the middle of a black bezel but at least you know the camera is covered when it’s switched on. The screen is always on which is nice during the day and the home screen can be adjusted to show just the time/wallpaper or rotate through news, weather, top stories and more.\n\nOverall the Show 5 has exceeded my expectations and I’ve very happy. There’s only a couple nit picky things I found but will defiantly start using Alexa more in my daily routine! Would highly recommend to a friend or anyone looking for a new Alexa device."},{"reviewerName":"Shopper111","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"If you are looking for a smart alarm clock, read this and save the packaging.","reviewDate":"November 2, 2019","reviewText":"For all the folks that want to buy this to use as an alarm clock, please be aware that the \"Try this ......\" messages at the bottom of the screen cannot be turned off.

But, perhaps that is a Hulu thing and not an Echo thing? I chatted with tech support about the matter and was assured that Hulu was indeed available on the Show 5. So, I performed all the hoop-jumping that one is obliged to perform when trouble-shooting a problem – all to no avail. I asked several times if anyone, anywhere, has ever successfully watched Hulu on an Echo 5. I never received an answer before she \"escalated\" the concern to the developers. That was three days ago and I have not yet heard back. At this price point, it is a much better display than the Spot – although as someone else has mentioned, the camera is in a weird place for video chats.

The size is of the Show 5 is just right for bedside use or a countertop. You would want a larger version of the Show if you wanted to watch movies, but I am not sure who would do that. The screen resolution is good and we can clearly view the video from our home cameras using the Nest skill. The screen brightness is good when viewing directly. When viewing from an angle, you are able to see the time and not much else. The auto dimmer is sensitive and can be a bit dark even with the brightness at the highest setting unless the room is bright. We use one bedside and when completely dark, the time/temp becomes a dark red. The red is dim and readable, not disturbing. The sound is very good for such a small product. We have listened to music and watched music videos and the Show 5 has a good amount of bass and the sound fills small rooms. Using the Alexa app, you can use the equalizer to adjust the sound, if you choose. The installed clock backgrounds are limited, but you can upload your photos using the app. We found that you must use photos that are bright. When using your photos as the background, the Show 5 allows you to adjust where the clock is located on the screen to avoid blocking the faces of your loved ones in the photo. The new camera shutter is a simple but essential security feature for use in bedrooms or bathrooms. We do not need to cover the camera with tape in the Show 5, as we did on the Spot. Overall, the Show 5 is everything that I had hoped that the compact Spot would be, with better features and a lower price."},{"reviewerName":"t anderson","rating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Sunrise option may not be available to you.","reviewDate":"July 24, 2019","reviewText":"Don't use Alexia but bought this for the sunrise clock and watching videos to fall asleep.

I had my eye on the various Show models for a while but felt they were a bit pricey when my Dots and Fire TV did 75% of the same things. When the Show 5 came out I was really interested, so I waited for Prime Day to purchase it. Super easy set up - it did take about 10 minutes to download and install the various updates, but that is to be expected. Sound quality is very good, especially considering the compact size. The screen looks fantastic when looking straight on, but like some of the cheaper Kindle models the quality goes down if you are looking at it from an angle. Interface is very intuitive once you figure out the swipe up/swipe to the right stuff. I appreciate the built in camera cover. I also purchased the stand to go along with it. I'm using it on my nightstand currently (replacing the 2nd generation Dot I previously had in the bedroom). I was worried it might be too bright overnight but no concerns there either (it does have the ability to dim the screen). I was kinda disappointed it wouldn't dim via Alexa command, but hey... can't have everything.

What I like so far:\n\n1. It looks great as a bedside clock. I set it to a big bold blue digital clock face and I love the look. I tried the option to cycle through the colors but I found that distracting.\n\n2. It works fantastically at night. My biggest fear was that it would be too bright at night and bother my wife who is sensitive to any light at all. However, it's nighttime illumination is as good as it can get, imo. I set the option to dim the screen at night. When my bedroom gets dark, the bright, bold blue clock dims to a completely black background and the clock numbers turn into a barely noticeable red color. The Echo Show 5 is only about 3 feet from my head, but in the dark it basically looks off/completely black. I need to focus on the clock to actually see the VERY dim red clock numbers, which is exactly what I had hoped for. From the other side of the bed, my wife doesn't even realize the Echo is even on.\n\nI've read others complain that it is too bright at night. I'm not sure if their settings are different from mine, but I don't see how it can be too bright for anyone, and I like my bedroom very dark at night.\n\n3. I have a Ring video doorbell. The Echo Show alerts me to someone at the front door. I can tell Alexa, \"Alexa, show me the front door\" and it quickly shows me a live video of the front door where I can see the person at the door, listen to the audio (if I choose) or unmute my mic and speak to the person at the front door. I think the only improvement I would make would be to immediately show me the live video of the front door without prompting from me, but I don't think it will do this.\n\n4. I like the manual camera cover-slide. With this camera cover, I am 100-percent sure that the camera is non-functional on the Echo Show in my bedroom until I physically open the camera cover.\n\n5. I wish it came with the optional little stand. Mine works fine without the stand, but it would be cool to have it. (But to me it's not worth $20 that Amazon is charging for the stand.)\n\n6.

We have gladly added thermostats, lights, TV and other modalities as they became available. Alexa has certainly become 'smarter' over the last few years and a useful addition to our home. Recently our cable provider upgraded our cable boxes--but with the upgrade, we lost the familiar blue clock that used to be included. Was considering digging out an alarm clock from a box in the basement when I saw that the Echo 5 was available at a good price over Prime day.\n\nIt functions well as an alarm clock and as a visible clock as well. The screen can be seen clearly across a 25 foot room, Because it is Amazon, the initial settings are a bt ambitious--flipping between weather, news, ads and all sorts of other junk. This was easy to change. All I want to do is be able to access Alexa and to be able to glance at the screen for the time when I feel like it. Having said that, the screen is about the size of a cell phone. You won't be watching movies or doing anything requiring detail. Note that there is no battery in this unt so, unlike a tablet, if the power is out, so is this.\n\nThe voice recognition is not quite as sensitive as standard cylindrical Alexa's-- there are less microphones and the ability to pick up your voice from across the room is less acute. Not bad though and still quite remarkable.\n\nThe sound is bass heavy but clear and surprisingly good. The unit has a camera and with all of the privacy concerns we all share, there is a mechanical shutter which can be used to physically block the lens--a great feature. Oddly, the camera is pointed way up-- if you want to use this as a two way video device,you need to hover above it to get your face rather than your belly in the picture. If you are using this to check in on grandpa from time to time you should take some pains to make sure that grandpa understands where the camera is pointed.\n\nAs the Alexa environment has added skills, the clunky method of invoking skills (Alexa, ask (name of skill) for...) has got to be improved and this complaint is obviously not specific to this model. Additionally most skills that are offered are junk. I am waiting for the day when Alexa can sustain a conversation of some complexity. I believe one of the greatest shortcomings is the lack of Google and reliance upon Bing for data.\n\nI am pretty satisfied with this jack-of-all-trades device but setting expectations is important."},{"reviewerName":"BeccaM","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Who knew such a small device could sound so big","reviewDate":"July 19, 2019","reviewText":"After years of barely being able to see the fading LED bedside alarm clock, the availability of a deal on Prime Day prompted me to go ahead and buy an Echo Show 5. I was also thinking perhaps it could replace the Gen 1 Echo Dot we've had in the bedroom, and as anyone who has one of those old Dots knows, the sound from them is tinny and awful unless you hook them up to an external speaker. So we had ours connected to a Creative D100 bluetooth speaker.\n\nWell, the Echo Show 5 actually sounds about as good as the D100. Maybe slightly less bass response, but not much. I was surprised that it sounded so good for such a small device--which is roughly the size of a normal smartphone turned on its side, with a triangular back that holds the extra electronics and speaker assembly.\n\nOne thing I like about the Show 5 that's an improvement over the Gen 1 and Gen 2 Echo Show devices (the larger models) is you don't have to look at that dumb \"Try, 'Alexa (some command)\" text. Just a nice big clock with the date and the weather. I wish the other Show models had this option.\n\nAnyway, it's a great device, but I would offer this suggestion to Amazon for the next generation of the Echo Show 5: Add on-board battery storage, so that the device can still set off the morning alarm even if main power is out. It's okay if the display stays off to conserve power, but it'd be nice to be assured that the alarm will go off even in the event of a power outage, like is the case for most regular alarm clocks."},{"reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","rating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Microfonos MALO","reviewDate":"August 1, 2019","reviewText":"El Echo Show 5 trae dos microfonos pero cuesta mucho que pueda escucharte, encuanto a la calidad de video es acptable comparando el precio, el sonido para su tamaño es aceptable, lo unico negativo son los microfonos no son tan sensible como los demas Echos, espero que en una mejora del sofwer puedan mejorar esa parte, Saludo desde Republica Dominicana."},{"reviewerName":"Michael Moffatt","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Latest update SUCKS!","reviewDate":"September 28, 2019","reviewText":"Echoes updated and now won’t display the clock, best display is time & temperature upper left, Try Alexa .... across the bottom.

Ever.","reviewDate":"July 19, 2019","reviewText":"Bought this during the Prime Day sale for my wife who said she needed a new alarm clock. Big mistake. This is the worst alarm clock ever. I'm focusing on the alarm clock issues, this is probably fine if you just want a clock or to replace an Echo Dot, which we have and really like. I traded in a Gen 2 Dot for a Gen 3 and like that even more.\n\nBefore I get started I'll add here I havent' had any problems w/ \"ads\". Dont' think Iv'e seen a single ad, and I know what ads look like we have 2 Fire tablets. The \"Ask Alexa\" lines show up on the bottom of the home screen occasionally, forcing the time to the top left, but it's fine, you can still read it.\n\nThe problem with the Show 5 as an alarm clock is almost entirely software driven. Seems like Amazon shipped this hardware without giving the software any though that all. Nothing makes sense.\n\nThe biggest problem by far - When you turn off your alarm clock, which you've set for \"Every weekday\", it actually turns it off off. It's gone, like it never existed. Even though you set it for \"every weekday\" and it says \"every weekday\" when it is listed, once you turn it off it's gone and Echo (wake up word I chose for ours) can't find it again. I've tried phrases like \"Echo show my alarm history\", \"Echo, reapply my last alarm\", 'Echo, turn on my last alarm\", you get the idea, but all Echo ever says is \"You dont' have any notifications right now\". So I have to tell it to reset it again.\n\nWhich brings us to problem number 2. The Show works as a streaming device, it can play music for your alarm, which is a big selling point, but Alexa is hard of hearing. So you say \"Echo, set an alarm for 5:30AM w/ Pandora\", but the first couple of times you say it she'll only set the alarm, not the music, it takes a few times for the \"Pandora\" part to stick. Which would be fine, if the \"Every Weekday\" put worked, b/c then we'd never have to set it again, but since it goes away every single day, we have to go through this every day.\n\nAn extra annoying thing about setting music for the alarm, which I'm sure MOST people would do, is that it isn't an option under 'Setting/Sounds/Alarms\". You can choose all sorts or alarms, even pseudo-celebrities like Tara Reid, waking you up in the morning. But there is no option under settings for music. None. Not even Amazon Prime Music or Amazon Music which would seem an obvious selling point. So rather then just choosing \"music\" you have to pick an alarm sound and then hope Alexa understands you want music added to your alarm.\n\nFourth minor problem. When you finally get your alarm set up, again, the way you'd like, sometimes the upper right corner of the screen says it;s set, but sometimes it doesn't. So the only way to know for sure if it's set or not is to ask her. I'm sure there's a rhyme and reason to it, but I can't figure it out. If it's set it should say so, period.\n\nAnd here's the extra frustrating part. When I go into my Alexa app on my phone all of this is there. Every time I've said \"Echo, set alarm for 5:30AM with Pandora\" it's listed there. Many many times. And if I click on 1 I can just turn it back on. But the actual Echo Show 5 doesn't have ANY of this information. The Alexa device doesn't have the Alexa app info? How stupid is that. Why can't \"Echo, turn on my last alarm\" work on the device itself? Why do I have to go into my 5\" phone screen to turn on my 5.5\" Echo device? It makes no sense.\n\nHopefully the software will catch up to the hardware, and Amazon's software engineers will realize if you have an option for \"EVERY WEEKDAY\" then the Echo shouldn't turn that alarm off every morning. And if the device does turn it off every morning, simply saying, \"Echo, turn my last alarm back on\" should work. Or \"Echo, show my alarm history/list\" should show the list so we can tap the one we want without having to go into our phone app.\n\nAfter all those issues it gets 3 stars for auto dimming, and night mode, which is very cool orange numbers on a black screen. But I bought it to be used as an alarm clock, not just a clock. If they figure it out - they can start by putting the app info onto the device - I'll review my alarm clock review."},{"reviewerName":"J.

I had a dot in my bedroom already but wanted a Show that could function as an alarm clock and show me my calendar and show news as I was getting ready, show the front door camera, etc. (These are the sorts of use cases this device is being marketed toward, as a bedside device) It does these things, of course, but with certain significant drawbacks. First, the voice recognition on this model is quite poor compared to what I had. Previously my dot was across the room and worked pretty well from my bed. Occasionally it might mishear me. I put this model much closer to me, on my nightstand, but it still has a lot of trouble - it doesn’t always respond to the wake word and frequently mishears me. I often have to repeat commands two to four times before it understands me. Never had these problems with the dot. Second, the screen is annoying on my nightstand. At first it was intolerably bad but I read some other reviews, adjusted some settings, and now it’s just bad. On its lowest brightness, with night mode enabled and with a dark theme and all “ads” disabled, it’s still way too bright. I can ask it to turn off its screen every night but it’s a bit of a pain. I wish it could auto turn off at a given time or respond to my smartphone “goodnight” command, rather than be an extra step each night. Oh ya, and since I have to turn the brightness down so low to get any sleep, it’s too dim the rest of the time so I tend not to use it or else have to manage the brightness twice a day, in the morning and at bedtime. Bleh. So much potential but the little details ruin everything. I appreciate and have come to depend on my other Echo products but this could use some fine tuning from the user experience perspective. I’ll probably return to using my gen2 dot in this room and await further refinements."},{"reviewerName":"Vincent","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Echo Dot With A Screen?","reviewDate":"July 25, 2019","reviewText":" Yeah, it's basically an Echo Dot with a screen. Able to get both visual and audio feedback.\n\nAll features can to utilized if you own a phone/tablet with clock app, and another echo device. But may not be as compact or have a portable form factor. Also the Echo Show 5 is somewhat more convenient depending on what you plan do with it.\n\nThe 5 in the name is not the the iteration rather a 5.5 inch screen size. Similar to non XL phones. Naming is probably in line with Amazon's Kindle Fire line of devices. In fact if you put a phone next to it, it may be around the same size (probably without the large bezels). Review photos, show it next to an iphone XR\n\nFirst impression: Looks like an alarm clock. Has an always on display. Does not have a static clock display as it cycles through random trending news, weather and alexa voice suggestions along with the time and date. Your next alarm/timer countdown shows up on the upper right of the screen which is a very nice feature. No need to go into Alexa app or ask Alexa when's the next alarm if you forgot.\n\nYou can set a background screen saver of pictures through your Amazon Photo profile if you don't like the default backgrounds or want to use it as a digital photo frame\n\nWhen using the activation word Alexa; it doesn't have the nice circular lights as the other echo devices, instead just a horizontal line on bottom of the screen. Would be cool if there's LEDs around the entire edge of device when you say the key word.\n\n2 mics vs 4 on Echo Dot 3rd gen. But has 1 more than most older echo devices.\n\nDoesn't have a physical Alexa button like the echo dot, so must use voice activation word; unless you link it to an Amazon remote.\n\nScreen doesn't show text of what you say. Example: Google assistant on your phone will show you what it predict you're saying if you use microphone/voice feature. Will show you various slides relevant to what you ask it. Example: when you ask for movie show times it's easier to view a list on screen then having Alexa reading out audibly on an echo dot the entire list of show times\n\nDevice has a physical privacy shutter on camera. Camera is not really impressive at 1 mega pixel. It's not HD, but the person on the other side can recognize you (unless their vision is really bad)\n\nAble to watch video on Amazon Prime, similar experience to watching on phone with lower resolution. Can watch youtube, but through silk internet browser. Probably never use it unless absolutely necessary like the 3DS or Wii U Nintendo systems if you own them.\n\nMusic. Able to view highlighted lyrics as song is playing if you're steaming music from Amazon Music. Karaoke style. Not able to do this with spotify music though.\n\nSunrise alarm feature. 15mins before your alarm, the screen will gradually turn brighter mimicking a sun rise. only works if you set your alarm between 4am and 9am and with auto brightness on (on by default) as it'll gradually increase to max brightness. Amazon probably only made it work between these times since your room may still be dark; as in a lighter setting the gradual light brightness may not have any effect. At night the screen will auto adjust to a black ground with orange text.\n\nTap top of the device with palm and/or fingers to snooze alarm. Cannot customize snooze times. Always set to 10mins\n\nNo battery. If power and/or internet goes out; alarm won't sound off similar to other echo devices. Unless you have backup power in your home or hook it up to a backup generator/battery.\n\nMicro USB port on back is not for power. Micro usb port possibly for firmware updates without internet connection.\n\nPower is supplied through a proprietary cable like most other echo devices. Wall outlet is huge and can take up an extra plug space especially if you use a power strip\n\nCompared to Echo Show, it has a smaller screen/lower resolution and the audio is not as good. No Dolby audio. able to connect a speaker to it via 3.5mm cable. It may distort at higher volume. Has good bass, able to feel the vibrations on the table. Speakers are on back, so won't fill the room as much as the Echo Dot which has a 360 speaker. Fabric on speaker similar to echo dot and Google Home Mini\n\nAble to link the ring door bell. only able to view live video. cannot view motions or rings.

Starting back with the 1st generation ones that came out. I was totally shocked and blown away by how well the microphones worked in them. I have echo dots that hear you precisely and they are located over in a different room. I waited on trying out this echo show but I recently got the Ring doorbell and the notion of being able to see who was at the door was intriguing. Plus being able to watch videos sounded appealing too. I got two of these echo shows and they both act exactly the same. I have been in the process of moving the last couple of months so didnt really get a chance to put these to the test. I have been using them quite a bit the last two weeks now and here is what I can say. They are practically worthless for having the microphone pick up what you say. I would say there is a serious design flaw in that they only pick up what you say when you are directly facing it. And even then if there is other noise happening they dont hear me.\n\nI wish I was not past the return period because they are no good for me. I have put them aside and have gone back to using the echo dots that work great.\n\nFor the echo show engineers- You need to work on having the Echo Show be able to hear you from wherever you are at in the room. Here is a good example- Lets say I am preparing a meal in the kitchen. I want to look up a recipe. The echo show will do that. But lets say I move from there and want to stream music. If I am in a position where I cant directly be in front of the echo it is not able to pick up what I say with the microphone.\nAlso- I havent discussed the speaker quality yet but it needs serious help."},{"reviewerName":"JAMES S MOLL","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Things to Try....

Needed a bedside alarm clock and this fits the bill perfectly. Seamless Plug and Play functionality is so easy to overlook these days as it's simply expected, and this couldn't have been easier. A little creepy that it knows who you are when you turn it on but that goes with the territory. Bought a cloud cam during last year's Prime Day (also an amazing product for $60). I asked Alexa to show me footage from the Cloud Cam and up it popped in 3 seconds. Pretty amazing to be watching the feed from an IR camera in the dark at the snap of a finger from a different floor of your house. Sound is deep and full enough to adequately fill a bedroom provided it's not huge and you aren't an over-bearing audiophile. At $50 it's an absolute steal, at $90 it's fairly priced.\n\nUPDATE: After using this thing for a day or so I have to qualify the last sentence and say that for $50 this device is literally like buying a $10 bill for $5 and at $90 it's still a solid deal. This is a easily a $100 device...the more I listen to the music on it the more it impresses me. The pricing of this says to me that Jeff Bezos desperately wants to be in your bedroom...hey, enjoy yourself Jeff you kinky bugger, you earned it Also,.

Now, during the day, it gets stuck on the \"try asking...\" screen where the time is in small font. It will cycle to the time after I give a command, but then goes back to the try-asking screen. Tried resetting and evrything possible...my next move will be to sell this POS. I loved my Amazon Tap and that has been running great for years, but never buying an Echo again. 0 stars.\n\n[update] Today, the alarm didn't go off while it was playing music. The alarm should take priority over anything else it's doing!! Not acceptable! And Amazon wouldn't even allow me to exchange this defective unit for the same one! Yeah, I did the whole reset/restart thing, but my confidence in this device is very low now and will not likely get another. Looking to get a Google Home Hub next.\n\nI was skeptical before purchasing the ES5 as other devices like this (from Google, Lenovo) got much better reviews. But I bit on the Prime Day hype and got this at a great price. I have an Echo Tap, so I thought it would at least be a step up in quality, functionality, & features. Won’t go into how frustratingly long it took to arrive, but I was excited when it finally did. And the first few days, I did love it: it’s cute, works well as a bedside clock (lens cover always on, of course), small footprint even with the stand.\n\nBut then the annoyances started to built: if you want to use your own photos, you have to upload photos to Amazon Photo, plus the transitions between pics are abrupt when they should be smooth. There’s no access to youtube and watching amazon prime video is extremely limited. Videos are not that big of a deal since I have my tablets where videos are better than on a tiny 5” screen, but it can be an issue if this is for your kitchen where you want to watch recipes and such. I thought Spotify would work better, but it’s the same limited functions as on my previous Echo. Plus, when you play Spotify, there's so much wasted space on the screen AND you lose the clock!\n\nBut the biggest issue I have are the “Try this...” messages that pop up. Yes, I’ve done the whole settings thing to supposedly turn them all off, but they’re still there. Anytime you ask Alexa to perform a task, the screen switches to a task screen, then switches back to the clock for about 10 seconds then switches to a “try this...” message for about 3 seconds. After that it stays on the clock face...that is until you ask Alexa to do another task and it all happens again.\n\nDespite its shortcomings, I’m keeping it. Meh, it’s a fifty-buck alarm clock that works with my smart home. And I figure I can trade it in when (if) they come out with an improved version next year. But if you’re considering buying one, PLEASE don’t pay more than fifty dollars...it’s not worth it."},{"reviewerName":"ET Barton","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"This thing Rocks!","reviewDate":"October 31, 2019","reviewText":"So you should probably know ahead of time, I am an Alexa addict. ADDICT!!! I am a flight attendant and the first thing I think when I walk into a hotel room is \"Alexa, lights on.\" Then I realize there is no Alexa and I sigh. I wish I could figure out a way to easily take Alexa with me while I travel. (And yes, I travel with the FireStick, but it's just not the same Alexa experience.)\n\nHaving said that, I love this Echo Show. It is just the right size. When I'm on a trip, I can pop in on it and call out to my kids to come to the Alexa so I can talk to them face to face from my Alexa phone app. The picture takes a minute to clear up on my phone, but the calls work out well. It also only shows the ceiling when you pop in on it, so you don't have to worry that anyone who video calls you will be able to see anything (or that government can see all of your moves). There is also a little button that allows you to physically cover the camera with flap so no one can see on the camera if you don't want it. I actually want to get one of these for my bedroom because my husband works nights and sleeps during the days. He's accidentally slept in when he was supposed to be picking up one of my kids from school. If we had one in our room, my daughter could have popped in on it to see that \"Dad\" was sleeping and either yell at him to wake up (because he doesn't hear the phone when he's sleeping) or realize that she needed to take the bus home.\n\nWe also use it for recipes, lights, the thermostat, to control our TV and to learn words to songs. I love that it shows the current weather outside all day and will flash to the week's weather forecast as well since we live in Chicago and the weather changes hourly. Soon I plan on getting the Alexa microwave and maybe one of those smart faucets to let Alexa control that too. Some part of me fears that Alexa will one day be the AI that sends Schwarzenegger back into the past to kill John Connor, but at the same time, I'm loving her too much to unplug her. I feel like we are living in an awesome \"in-between time\" of when technology is our best friend and when the robots turn on us. I'm going to enjoy the \"in-between time\" while I can and just hope that the robotics companies stop programming attack robots (like you can watch on YouTube... lol.)\n\nI highly recommend getting one.

It's a great little device with some nice added features that you can see and hear very well. I really wanted to give this 5 stars, but there are two things that are extremely annoying (to me), that I'm told cannot be changed, that keep my rating lower.\n1. The bottom of the screen constantly shows tips...\"Try saying Alexa (insert tip here).\" There is no way to turn off that feature. Being an Echo device Veteran, this is both distracting and annoying, since the screen is constantly flashing different tips, which causes me to look at the screen. I currently have it right next to my computer screen, so it's a pain not to be able to turn that feature off.\n2. I love that this device works with my Ring security cameras and you can ask it to show you the camera...however, there is a delay from the time you ask, until you see the camera view. I have the best wi-fi and super fast internet here, so I know that isn't the issue. The delay isn't good, especially when using this device with a Ring Doorbell. By the time you see who's at the door and try to speak with them, they are already leaving. I would love to see an option to automatically launch the Ring Camera video on the Echo Show, when motion is detected. That might improve the delay problem it currently has.\nOtherwise, I am enjoying the Echo Show 5 very much and my favorite feature is the manual camera shutter, which let's me block the camera lens when I'm not using it. Great feature for added security."},{"reviewerName":"Jeff L.","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Better than the Echo Spot.","reviewDate":"July 11, 2019","reviewText":"I got this to replace the Echo Dot in my bedroom and it works perfectly as a bedside alarm clock. I have quite a few Echo devices now including a couple Spots and I can't see any reason for getting a Spot over this unless you really need the smaller footprint of the Spot. It simply does everything the Spot can do, but with a larger screen, cheaper price and better privacy.\n\nI was about to get another Echo Spot until I saw the Show 5 up for pre-order and I'm glad I procrastinated up until then. With my short sightedness, it would have been difficult to see the time from bed had I gotten the Spot, but the Show 5's screen allows the time to be shown in big numbers. I can also answer the door if someone rings my Ring Doorbell Pro or I get a motion alert and see much more detail compared to what I can see on the Spot. Having a physical cover over the camera, which the Spot lacks, also brings better peace of mind.\n\nAs one would expect, the sound on the Echo Show 5 is not amazing, but it gets the job done for what it would mainly be used for. For music, connecting a dedicated Bluetooth speaker(s) would be a more preferable option.\n\nLastly, they need an option to disable the Alexa \"try\" suggestion cards. It wouldn't be hard to do and yet they prefer to leave it in and annoy customers and lose sales despite the massive amount of feedback given on the subject. Instead, they spend the time to add an additional side swipe menu screen, which I don't find much use for personally, though I suppose it would be useful for someone that is mute."},{"reviewerName":"PS_in_Idaho","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great for a bedroom or side table","reviewDate":"July 26, 2019","reviewText":"We use this in our bedroom in place of an alarm clock. We had an echo dot in the bedroom but wanted to upgrade so that we would have a clock. My wife hates anything that has a screen on it, she thinks they control too much of our lives; I actually think she was destined to be born in the middle ages but was born in the wrong time period. She actually loves the Echo Show 5 because she said she was always asking the Echo dot what time it is, now we just have to look at the new Show 5. This is really nice when waking up in the morning to see quickly whether you need to get up or you have more time to sleep.\n\nWe haven't done anything special for the setup other than change the background of the clock. At night it automatically dims and does not scroll through the different feeds, it just stays on the clock. During the day we let it scroll through the feeds, but we like seeing the news stories and Alexa suggestions. In the App it is super easy to turn these off though.\n\nSetup was easy, but I had one problem with my Philips Hue lights. For some reason a new group was setup in my Alexa App named bedroom (I stated the Echo would be in my bedroom but I'm not sure why Alexa created a \"Bedroom\" group). My Philips Hue lights have a group named bedroom. Therefore, when I asked Alexa to turn off the bedroom lights it would default to the Alexa bedroom group and would say that the bedroom didn't support that function. After a little digging I deleted the Alexa group named bedroom and everything started working again.\n\nAll functions, at least that I used, work with Alexa. I set my morning alarm to wake me up to classical music. The voice recognition is good and I don't have to yell at it. I thought the speakers would be better just based on the reviews. However, compared to other items this size and cost the sound is really good, much better than a typical alarm clock.\n\nMy plan is to load pictures to it and have it scroll through pictures during the day to be like a digital picture frame.\n\nAll-in-all I think the Echo Show 5 is well worth it.

This is a nice introduction to the Spot echo system and allows you to get an idea of what having a touch screen on an echo dot buys you. It only has 2 microphones so it does not pick up and understand my voice as well as the 3rd gen dot that I replaced it with. It is nice to have the clock face with weather displayed when not in use. Also nice to have album art and/or lyrics when streaming music. I would give it 4 stars, but instead of including a 6 foot power cord, they tried to cut a few cents and cut the cord to 5 feet. I needed that extra foot. I had to swap the cord on one of my echo dots which does come with a 6 foot cord. Why would they do that. Minus another one point. Sound quality is OK. Some functions that are easily changed in the Alexa app for the Echo Dot have been removed and force you to use the touch screen on the Spot 5 or are missing all together compared to the Dot. If I ever get a video door bell it will be nice to see action at the front door while in my office. So I'm future proofing a little here. The 1 MP camera is a bit disappointing compared to the 5 MP of its big brother. The screen is quite grainy compared to most smart phones and tablets these days. Some of the down grades and short cuts make this more of a toy, but does help to keep the price down. I would not pay full price for this, so I would suggest that you wait for the regular sales throughout the year if this is on your list but you are hesitating because of the price. At the sale price it is easier to forgive it's short comings.\nUpdate:\nChanging my review from 3 stars to 1 star. After the last software update, the Show 5 will not stop displaying the \"Try 'bla, bla, bla'\" try this , try that, nag screens. Yes I have \"Rotate Continuously\" turned off. I also have everything else turned off. Enough is enough, I bought this to display the clock in full screen not to be minimized to the upper left corner so Amazon can push their useless \"Things to Try\".

After some futzing around, I was able to set via voice an alarm to come on weekdays at 6:20am to my local PBS radio station via the TuneIn integrated app. I have a favorite photo as the clock background and the clock dims marvelously in response to ambient light levels. Additionally, it is a regular interface to Alexa via voice command. As a replacement for my old radio alarm clock, it wins hands down. Although setting it up took quite some (unnecessary) doing.\n\nThere are three input and status checking mechanisms: voice control via local or remote Alexa; the Alexa app on phone or tablet; and, the touch screen. The absence of a meaningful written manual means that one is left to experiment with the currently limited and inconsistent trio of interfaces, each of which seems capable of different things. There is no one ring to rule them all, as far as I can see ... yet.\n\nThe adverbs scattered about above - yet, currently, etc - plus the \"futzing\" indicate the strengths and weaknesses of the device. Clearly, it is early days and the users should help drive the improvement of the interface. I have already sent my list to Amazon ... no response! As a repeat early adopter - I received mine on day 2 of availability - this is partly my own fault. But Amazon needs to provide much better written information about menus and capabilities of the device and of the role of each of the interface mechanisms. I really truly lament that thousands of people will be fleeced of their money on a totally useless book called something like An Idiot's Guide to Echo Show 5, which will promise, but totally fail, to reveal the tricks. It should not be this way. Amazon lost a star because of this. There is not even a website or any useful guidance to menus on screen or in apps. Maybe they expect someone else, through sheer exasperation, to set up a Stack Exchange page. It won't be me.\n\nHowever, and in absolutely no way forgiving of their omission, the mere existence of an automated online upgrade path for the device is one way to ensure that it updates and upgrades to achieve it evident potential. Of course, this all presupposes that someone actually tells people what has been done.\n\nI want to set up and control my device. I do not want to hear another pirate joke from Alexa.

There are a lot of reviews for this device, so I'll just list a few things that I'm really impressed by:\n- The clock face is customizable and very easy to read from anywhere in the room. The screen has no distortion or discoloration from any angle, so it is easy to see from everywhere.\n- The screen adapts to the surrounding light. At night, when the room is completely dark, the screen decreases to almost black with just red numbers for the clock. Perfect for checking the time in the middle of the night, and more comfortable than my older LED numbered clocks.\n- The alarm clock has a slow volume increase, so if I can wake up to the softer tones, then I can turn it off before my wife wakes up. If I'm sleeping really deeply, then it will increase until I finally wake up.\n- You can set a recurring alarm to every day or every weekday, and it's easy to skip a day on the schedule by just saying \"Alexa, skip tomorrow's alarm.\" There is a small notification in the top-right corner that shows the next upcoming alarm.\n- The music alarm can be sourced from Spotify, Amazon Music, or Pandora (probably other sources as well), so I can wake up to a particular song or to a station if I want to wake up to a different song of the same genre.\n- The touch-screen is very responsive, so when the alarm goes off in the morning, you can speak audibly to turn it off, or you can reach over to swipe \"Dismiss\" or swipe down to snooze.\n- Some of the skills that are designed for Echo Show are great. I recommend playing Jeopardy or looking up recipes.\n- My wife is very grateful for the physical camera shutter as we keep it in our bedroom.\n\nSome things that I don't love:\n- Every once in a while, it will forget the recurring alarm, so you have to reset it. It's a bit of a hassle to explain to Alexa when you want the alarm to go off on what schedule to what music station. Small complaint for how great everything has been.\n- The screen is small, so I don't recommend trying to watch shows or movies on it. It would be similar to setting your phone on the counter and watching a movie on it.\n- Others have mentioned the scrolling screen. This is not a big deal to me, but you can limit what scrolls through, so it's pretty much just the weather and a few suggestions for what to try. This has been a deal-breaker for some, but I'm not certain why. This doesn't happen at night (at least as far as I've noticed) when the screen is black with red numbers. I suspect that the Echo does it to avoid burned images in the screen; if that's the case, then I'm grateful for it.\n\nBottom line: I highly recommend it as a very smart and very useful alarm clock and Echo device. It has its limitations, but frankly, for the price, the limitations are minuscule compared with the benefits of it. We did have it in our kitchen previously (I thought it would be nice to be able to look up recipes hands-free), but we didn't find it to be that useful there, so at least for our situation, it has been an excellent bed-side alarm clock/Echo."},{"reviewerName":"Tim","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Show 5 review from a Spot owner","reviewDate":"July 19, 2019","reviewText":"There is a lot of details already in these reviews, so I just wanted to add a few points.

I wanted to be able to know what time it was by looking at the thing with my glasses off. That problem is happily solved with the Show.\n\nFirst off anyone who is seeing lots of ads hasn't spent much time in the setup. I mostly want to see the time displayed, and it wasn't hard to tell the device not to be constantly showing other stuff in the full screen (which might include stocks, weather, tips / suggestions, etc.) I do still get a row at the bottom of the screen suggesting Alexa commands to try, but it's small and not intrusive. If it was showing big ads on the screen I'd send it back, but that is not what this is.\n\nMy second point concerns a problem that I had and managed to resolve. After I replaced the Spot with the Echo 5, there were multiple times when I started to get something similar to static from the device, kind of a distortion. It made Alexa sound like she had a lisp, and music was noticeably distorted. A reset of the device would solve the problem temporarily but then it came back after a while. At some point I realized that I had replaced the Echo itself, but not the power adapter; I was still using the adapter from the Spot. When I swapped this for the adapter that came with the Show 5, this problem disappeared and it now sounds fine. If this always happened I think we'd be seeing more complaints about it, but if you happen to encounter this issue I highly recommend trying a different adapter if you have one. The old adapter still works fine for the Spot, and I think the specs for the adapters are the same so I don't have an explanation for why this matters, but there you are.\n\nFinally I wanted to comment on sound quality for music, since I know that was one of my questions when pondering this upgrade. The Show 5 sounds significantly better than the Spot. There are a lot of small bluetooth speakers around these days that sound much better than it seems they should for their size, and the Show 5 must be doing some of the same tricks. It's not quite as good as my Bose Soundtouch (which I connect the Echo to via bluetooth if I'm spending significant time in the bedroom) but it's close.\n\nI will say that the Alexa app still seems to have some rough edges working with the new device. Sometimes the new device disappears from the app device list altogether and I need to restart the app. But that's minor IMO and I'm sure will soon be resolved.\n\nSo in conclusion I'd say it's a worthwhile upgrade especially if you have another place to put the Spot. I now have it as a clock sitting on my computer that can tell me how to spell things."},{"reviewerName":"Rbry Inc","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Better then Spot","reviewDate":"July 5, 2019","reviewText":"I see there are a lot of complaints and for the most part I do not understand ,most of them. The constant scrolling is 100% a pain and you can turn 90% of it off. It is 100% worth the price to either upgrade from the spot(trade it in, will knock about $30 of the price) I feel it is exactly what it is suppose to be. A spot with a bigger screen at $40 less. It is 100% worth the money. You want more quality pay the bigger price and buy the show. You want a really cool bedside clock that has 100s of more functions then a regular clock you can not go wrong here for the price. If you want to pay $90 but expect $300 in quality well good luck.. I will say though the Mics are very very bad. I use it as an alarm and when the music plays I really have to yell at it for it to respond"},{"reviewerName":"Thomas Raven","rating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Revised Review - The best echo show yet marred by annoying \"try\" feature","reviewDate":"July 12, 2019","reviewText":"Revised review:\nThe software on this device is infuriating. It simply will NOT display the numerals of the clock large and in the center of the screen 24/7. Instead, it frequently (FREQUENTLY!) makes the time display small and shoves it in the corner while it suggests that I \"try\" this or that feature. I've read all sorts of posts about this issue and have dug into the menus both on the device and in the app and there's no way to turn this \"feature\" off. Amazon, listen up! If this is going to sit on my nightstand and be my primary clock, IT NEEDS TO DISPLAY THE TIME! As it stands now, the display is useless. I'd be better off with a regular Echo, or no Echo at all. A $12 digital clock works better than this device. What a total waste of money.\n\nOriginal review:\nI wanted an Echo alarm clock but wasn't convinced that the spot was really useful due to its small screen. My eyesight is pretty bad so I need something with large numbers so I can read them at night. For a while, I used my gen 1 Echo as a clock, just using voice commands but that got old fast. I was thrilled to see this new form factor Echo and bought it as soon as it went on sale. It's the perfect size and has all the features I want in a nightstand device. On top of that, it actually sounds really great and the mics are very proficient at hearing me, even from another room. They're so good that my gen 1 Echo seems to be hard of hearing in comparison. I like the choices of background images and especially like the camera cover. The only thing missing is YouTube.\n\nBottom line - this is like having a smart phone on your nightstand with a dedicated speaker. What's not to love at this price point?"},{"reviewerName":"Earl Mcgehee","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Alexa ads viewing device (UPDATED - better)","reviewDate":"September 28, 2019","reviewText":"When I first got this device 3 months ago I mostly liked it, but then it started displaying \"Try asking Alexa..\" almost continuously instead of showing the big clock.

It works perfectly for this reason. When I ask Alexa to show me either garage camera (floodlight) or backdoor camera (ring 2 doorbell) it responds within 5-10 seconds. I get the camera feed(s) for at least 10 miniutes (haven't really timed it). I can watch my dog when she goes out and even talk to her (freaked her out at first but now she's used to me being invisible). At this point, I get only 'live views' and not any recordings or this is possible but I just don't know how to request a past event. The ES5 allows the microphone to be activated on both the ring doorbell and floodlight, but I can't turn on the floodlight or the siren (features available in the ring phone app) but I'm sure these software features can be added at a later date. The camera views are surprisingly sharp and clear even at night. The sound is amazing as I can even hear birds singing or crickets chirping! At night, I use the echo show 5 for an alarm clock (it's about the same size). There's a setting that allows the display to be dimmed at night but the normal display really doesn't bother me at night. I replaced a dot with the echo show 5 and basically use it the same way except for the ring video views. I've had no wifi connection problems but I upgraded my router and added a wifi extender when I got the ring devices. Highly recommend the echo show 5 to use with Ring security cameras."},{"reviewerName":"Ashanti","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Good deal.","reviewDate":"July 14, 2019","reviewText":"It is much smaller than I thought.

This resulted in a return and replacement for me. It was my hope that by doing this, the screen on the replacement wouldn’t be hot and the sound quality would be better.\n\nThis was not the case at all. I’ve returned the second Echo show 5 and replaced it with an Echo Dot. The Echo Dot has superior sound quality, understands what I’m saying better, and is much cheaper.\n\nMy final thoughts:\n-The “Try Alexa” text simply needs to be an option you can change in the settings. There is absolutely no other way around this. There is NO reason I should even be seeing it when using a subscription like Spotify. It makes no sense. Why would a customer want advertising they can’t remove on a speaker they paid too much for, during use of a paid subscription, all from a company that is also a monthly subscription (Prime)?\n-the screen being hot is very concerning, and even if amazon finds this to be normal, it is uncomfortable when trying to use the touch screen.\n-Why on earth is the sound quality a downgrade from this product when it costs more than the other Echos?\n-This becomes a $90 paperweight.\n-I enjoyed seeing my calendar on the screen until I realized I could never turn the try Alexa ads off.\n-I’ll wait to buy one when these issues are fixed.\n-I probably will never buy one again.

With the changes they have made now however we finally felt like it was safe enough to buy an Echo Show 5 (and a couple of Dots). I love that we essentially have a whole home stereo now as I can have my music play across all of the devices. (Great for cleaning days!) I've seen some reviews that have mention poor sound quality but I think it is at least the equivalent to a good quality Bluetooth speaker. I like the announcement feature as I can track my husband down when he is upstairs and I'm downstairs. Lol. I also love that I can drop in throughout the day to check on our dogs while we are at work and I love the Guard (security) feature that you can turn on when you are away. It alerts you if the devices detect the sound of glass breaking or smoke alarms going off. That was an unexpected plus as we hadn't heard anything about that feature.\n\nThere is a lot more that you can do with one of these devices than we realized. We spent an hour playing a Song quiz game where Alexa plays a bit of a song and you have to guess the song title and artist.\n\nWe like the \"drop in\" feature pretty well but even with the security features I'm leary of having anything but one of the Echo dot's in our bedroom. There is a slide that covers the camera so I think it would be fine....but just incase I will limit the Echo Show to the less private rooms in my house.\nThe camera is decent on it and it picks up our voices from a decent distance without us feeling like we have to yell to wake it up. Video quality when you do a drop in will depend on the speed of your internet.... mine isn't great so it takes a minute for the video to be clear but it works...\n\nNow for the negative: Ugh, the location of the camera on the top corner. The way the Echo Show 5 is designed it kind of tilts back. So if you want to drop in and be able to view someone sitting or in my case my pets then it has to basically be tilted forward and down (you have to buy a stand and are pretty limited on options there) .... so it basically looks like it is getting ready to fall over..... (We have ours sitting on a short bookcase and had to purchase a stand for it.)\n\nOverall:\nIf you don't have one of these products I would highly recommend going to Best Buy or whatever is near you and talking to someone/playing with a demo version. I really didn't think I would like it as much as I do but I now have two Echo Show 5's and two Echo Dots (3rd generation).\n\n(With the holidays coming don't forget you can buy them on payments sometimes on Amazon vs paying in full at a store!

I got the Echo Show to use mainly as a bedroom clock, but that was a poor decision on my part. The main problem has been mentioned in many other reviews, and that is that this device wants to show me everything except the one thing I want it to always show - THE CLOCK!! Whenever I look at the \"clock\" from across the room, I'd really like to see what time it is. Apparently, that's asking too much from this device.\n\nI know all about the tricks to disabling the scrolling Alexa suggestions, and they do work...for a few days. However, every time there is a power surge or flicker, the thing automatically goes back to the scrolling Alexa suggestions. They just won't go away!! What's even more annoying is that when you successfully shut the suggestions off, this thing likes to minimize the clock face ANYWAY. For whatever reason, the clock face and the outside weather like to jump to the upper left side of the display and leave some random picture its place. Then I have to go back to Google to find out how to get it to JUST SHOW THE CLOCK. Once you figure it out again, it'll work...until it decides you need to see something other than the clock. This morning it kept telling me to ask Alexa about Albert Einstein. I don't care what Alexa knows about Albert Einstein. I just want to see what time it is!!!!!\n\nBy the way, the sound is really terrible on this thing. On my original Echo, the sound is quite good.

It uses my vacation photos stored on my local network as the background for the clock face, changing the photo about every ten seconds (this can be adjusted). I use the Show to wake me in the morning, either to one of the pre-configured recordings or any music I like. For instance, I can say, \"Alexa, wake me at 5:50am to 90s music and bam, it's done! I can set as many alarms and timers as I like. I can also snooze the alarms simply by touching the top of the device. And I can easily cancel the alarm just by using touch, so I don't have to wake my wife by talking to Alexa.\n\nSpeaking of talking to her, it is so cool how Alexa understands me even when I quietly whisper to her, and she whisper's back!!

(I use a set of Anker Liberty true wireless ear buds for this.)\n\nUsing the Alexa app on my iPhone, I can easily \"drop in\" to the Show 5, video talking to my wife through the app. And I can watch music videos and even stream Amazon Prime content to the screen, using it as a mini-TV while in bed.\n\nThe other cool thing I like is that the show displays the lyrics (when available) to the music it is streaming. And I can have it tune to any radio station, including my Sirius/XM radio stations.\n\nI've only set up some limited home automation so far, but I can use any of my Echo devices to open our garage doors and turn on certain outdoor lights (through their Kasa WiFi wall switches). The next thing I want to do is set up some kind of video doorbell that is compatible with this device.\n\nAnother nice feature is it has an on-screen keyboard option so you can type in a question or command for Alexa so you don't have to speak it. This is nice when you don't want to make any noise to awaken your bed partner.\n\nThe only suggestions for improvement I have so far are:\n1) Add the ability to set alarms for specific days of the week, say every Monday, Thursday and Friday. (Even my old Logitech Squeezebox could do that.) Right now, you can set recurring alarms for weekends, every day, or weekdays, but not for specific days. That would be really handy for me because my work schedule requires me to wake at different times depending on the day of the week.\n2) The viewing angle of the screen could be a bit better. It's not bad but if you start getting away from center when viewing the screen, it fades out pretty quickly. I'm ordering the ezbnb Show Anywhere metal stand to see if this helps with positioning the screen for optimal viewing.\n\nIn summary, this thing is a bargain for what it does. If you are looking for a great \"smart\" clock radio that is small, attractive and fits nicely on a nightstand, look no further. I think it is a bargain and I'm sure the firmware will continue to get updated with even more useful functionality and features. I have no regrets that I bought the Echo Show 5."},{"reviewerName":"HealthyArtist","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Glitchy and won’t keep large type clock showing. UPDATED NOV. 6, 2019.","reviewDate":"October 31, 2019","reviewText":"I liked this product in the beginning, in spite of not being able to dismiss the annoying “Try” suggestions at the bottom of the screen. It worked fine for a couple of weeks. Then, I’m assuming, there was an update that completely screwed up the home screen. I have always had it set to show the large clock with Amazon photos as the background and the weather in small type in the top left corner and the date in small type below the large type time. Now I can’t get the large clock to show for more than a few seconds. I didn’t change anything for that to happen. And I’ve tried everything since this started to try and fix the problem. I searched for an answer online only to find a large number of people having the same issue without any solution. In the advertising for this item the large clock is always showing, which is misleading since that isn’t an option for more than a few seconds before it reverts back to the tiny type in the upper left corner. It also has glitches sometimes where the numbers and letters sit on top of one another. (See photo) Until these issues are fixed I give the Echo Show 5 only 1 star.\n\nUPDATE: The clock issue, which was my biggest problem, seems to be working right now. *knock wood* So I’m changing my rating to 4 stars. I did have to turn night mode off for this to be fixed. I have tried all of the suggestions from other reviewers, btw. So just because those instructions worked for you doesn’t mean it works for all. Hopefully these issues will all be worked out in updates. But for now I’m happy enough with the way it’s working to say it’s worth purchasing."},{"reviewerName":"jeffreyh51","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great Little Unit, but...","reviewDate":"September 18, 2019","reviewText":"I waited for awhile to post this review in order to give the unit some time to perform. While I must say that I love it, there are a few things that irk me. I’m using it on the nightstand to replace my 1st Edition Show, as the larger unit cast way too much light next to the bed. The smaller form factor is much better in that area, particularly with its night mode, and the sound is great for my purpose.\n\nMy first unit kept losing its WiFi connection (about 2-3 times a day) in spite of the fact that it was about 15 feet from a wired Amplifi HD mesh point, and showed a very consistent 90% signal. The 1st edition Show never once lost its WiFi the entire time it was in place. To their credit, Amazon replaced the first with a new one, but it still, on occasion, loses its signal, albeit about 1-2 times a week, that I know of. There’s absolutely no reason for it to be doing that, other than something different from the 1st Edition with the internal radio hardware of the unit.\n\nAlso, I frequently am away from the house for a few days at a time, and I normally set my two 1st Edition Shows, as well as this Show 5 to turn the screen off during that time. The two larger Shows’ screens stay off for the duration, but the Show 5 screen will not stay off for more that about an hour or so before mysteriously turning back on. Sometimes it’s after only about 5 minutes. I have been testing it while home, and it consistently does that with no intervention from either me or any Alexa commands. Whether or not the camera is covered make no difference.\n\nOther than those two things, it performs well, and I like the Show 5 a whole lot. I just wish the above two irks were somehow resolved."},{"reviewerName":"Christine C. Gaunder","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Display a definite plus","reviewDate":"August 17, 2019","reviewText":"Primarily I use my Echo Show to listen to various radio programs, although it is certainly not limited to just that. I haven't been able to find a radio that tunes in well to \"my\" stations, but there is NO problem with reception with the Echo Show. Many reviews mentioned how annoying the \"ads\" are on the screen, but they don't really bother me, as they are not actually what I think of as ads, and sometimes the display shows something newsworthy. So, to me, I can overlook the annoyance and focus on the positive. I haven't yet put photos on my display, but I hope to do that soon. It is nice to be able to ask Alexa questions and have her \"guard\" the house for me and play games (although without Amazon Prime, the games can be somewhat limited, just as the radio stations/music are). One thing that can be done on the Echo Show that can't be done on the Echo Dot is to see -- for instance, the multiple choice answers to certain questions are shown on the display, lyrics to shown are frequently displayed, and that's a good feature. For me, there's too much bass, even when I turn it down all the way, but maybe it's just me.\n\nThe one thing I do not like, on both of the Echo products I have, is the inaccurate weather. I've even contacted Amazon Echo/Alexa specialists about this, and I was told that even if you enable a skill such as Dark Sky or Big Sky, the Echo still \"goes through\" AccuWeather, which makes no sense to me. I've found AccuWeather to not be very ACCUrate. And it actually irks me to look at the screen and see the weather displayed as a temperature I KNOW is wrong. Typically, the temperatures here are approximately 10° higher than the display shows or what Alexa claims to be the current temperature. If someone could figure out how to fix that, I'd be quite happy with the Echo Show."},{"reviewerName":"Seaotter","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Best overall Echo Show device for most people","reviewDate":"July 18, 2019","reviewText":"update 9/19/19\nReading some of the other reviews on the 5, I don't think that a lot of people understand how Echos/Alexa work. They seem to think that the 5 is just a high tech stand a!one alarm clock, which it isnt.\nOne review said that the weather function was inadequate. If that's the case, just enable another one. There are too many for me to count.\nanother said that they returned theirs, and were going to wait for an upgraded version. Alexa is the same on a every device, and is being continual!y updated.\nOne review said the the 5 doesn't have YouTube. It does. It's kind of a kludge, but it works.\nA lot of reviewers gripe about the ads. I don't even notice them. My wife likes the suggestions, and often responds to them. Amazon sells stuff. If you don't want to see the ads, just don't look at them.\nA.m.s co.plain about the video capabilities. They are fine, although I can't get Hulu to run on it either (works fine on my gen1). TBH, I prefer to watch them on side screen tv. Or my Fire 10 tablet. But I had watched videos on it, and the interface is fine once you get used to it. But watching a whole movie on a 5 inch screen isn't really ideal.\n\nI have decided that the sound is better than it is on the Spot. Maybe a bit better than my 3 gen Dot, but not by much. The Cot actually sounds pretty good. The regular Echos and my 1gen Show both sound better, but all of them are enjoyable to listen to.\n\nI still think the Spot is a better alarm clock. The 5 is great for the kitchen, and the Show is in the !living room. That works out well for us. I am retired, but I would have loved to have a 5 on my desk in my office! When I want a spelling, or a definition, or a sum, or to put an event on a calendar, or a news update, or need to know it's one of my staff's birthday, all I would have to do is ask. IMHO, that would be wh ere the 5 would shine.\n\nUpdate 8/14/19\nThe Show 5 is still working just fine. My Spot has returned to my bed stand, though, as the Show 5 takes up a bit too much room. Its not that the 5 is really all that big. Itv is about the same size as a 1990's era clock radio, but my bed stand is rather small. And I like the clock faces on my Spot better. Several YouTube reviews state that the Spot has been rendered redundant by the Show 5. I disagree. Each fits a unique niche. But I agree that the Spot should not cost so much. The Show 5 is a much better value at the current pricing.\n\nPrior to buying this, I already owned a Echo Show and an Echo Spot, as well as a regular Echo and several Echo Dots, so I think it is fair to say that I am familiar with Echo devices and Alexa. My review of the Echo Show 5 will be comparing it to those other devices.\nThe Echo 5 has a fairly small screen, which is about the size of a large smart phone. The resolution is fairly low according to the specs, but that is not readily apparent when viewing in. I can watch the Echo Show screen across the room. With the Echo Spot I have to be quite close to watch it (yes, I watch videos on the Spot. The screen is tiny but it is fine if you have it on your night stand). The Show 5 is somewhere in between. You can see it easily across your desk. It is great on a kitchen counter. It is NOT a small room TV replacement, like the regular Show could be.\nThe sound on the Show 5 is about the same as the Echo Spot. Much better than the gen2 Dot, about on par with the gen3 Dot, but not as good as the regular Echo or the fill size Show.\nAlexa on the Show 5 is exactly the same as on the regular Echo Show, which is not surprising, as Alexa is in the Cloud, not on your device. It seems to me that the Echo 5 has a somewhat slower response time, but that is REALLY hard to tell. As the devices are cloud based, the response time might well have more to do with the Wi-Fi connection at a certain location in your house than the device itself! Regardless, response times on all of the devices are acceptable on my DSL service. BTW, the Spot does not have the same functionality as the others. It has no browser, so no YouTube.\nAs far as value goes, the Show 5 is by far the best value. It does everything the larger Show can do, for half the money. If you bought it for $50 on Prime day, as I did, its a steal.\nSo is it for you? That depends. If you want a large screen and great sound for your living room or den, then get the full size Show.\nIf you want a bed stand clock, the Spot takes up less room, and I think that its perfect for that role. I REALLY like my Spot! If the Spot and the Show 5 were the same price, I would recommend the Spot. But at a significantly higher price? I am afraid that, without a sizable cut in price, the days of the Spot are numbered!\nBut if you want just one Echo show device, or if you are just entering the Echo community, the Echo Show 5 is by far the best choice."},{"reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","rating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Disappointed","reviewDate":"September 29, 2019","reviewText":"I wanted to like this echo but I was disappointed. The idea that I can't keep a clock I choose on the screen at all times without intermittently being bombarded with alexa suggestions is ridiculous. And yes, I turned off continuous rotation. Not only that, there are several bugs, including turning off the alarm while in snooze mode.\nTry harder before releasing a product Amazon."},{"reviewerName":"Dave's Thoughts","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Nice clock, but has a few glitches.","reviewDate":"August 28, 2019","reviewText":"I purchased this to replace my bedroom dot and bedside clock with a single device., and for that, this definitely does the trick. The interaction is pretty much the same as a standard dot. All the usual commands still work fine. The big difference is of course the visual feedback. For example, when I say \"turn on bedroom lights,\" it does that, but it also gives me a visual of the dimmer setting. So if they are on, but turned down to zero, I can easily see that, and then manually turn them up using the switch, or on the visual on the show 5, or using my voice. So for some things like that, the expanded functionality is great. So I really like the visual helps and the added quick access for my smart home features.\n\nOne thing I don't like is how bright it is at night. Even using night mode, this thing still makes my room very bright. Plus, depending on which clock background you use, the letters in Night Mode might be red, which is OK for night vision. OR they might be blue/white, which is very bad for night vision. There is the option to say \"turn off display\", and that works fine, UNTIL you have to interact with the device - OR - if you cough, then the device wakes up and starts listening, and the screen turns on again. Then you have to say - loud enough for it to hear you - \"turn off display.\"\n\nAlso, even if you use the sunrise feature, and you have the display off - it doesn't come on when the alarm goes off, until you physically touch the display or you use the wake word. So the intelligence behind turning the display on and off could definitely use some work. Even with the do not disturb on during night hours, it will still wake up occasionally and I have to tell it to turn back off. Then in the mornings, with an alarm, it doesn't come on. So definitely some glitches to work out.\n\nFor me, it would be nice, if you could set a time for the display to be off and stay off. Maybe even in a routine. Then if you wake up, and need to check the clock with a voice command or a touch, it would be great if the clock would come on for a few seconds and then the display would then go back off again so it wouldn't disrupt my sleep too much. That would be nice. Also, it would be nice if you could set the delay time before it switches back to night mode or the display turns off - like on a cell phone; a simple screen timeout. That would be super nice.\n\nSo Pros: Sound seems a little better, more full, than a standard Gen 3 dot. And the visuals are great. You can even watch a movie - but not sure who would want to on such a small screen.\n\nAnd Cons: Way too bright at night, even in night mode. Not enough adjustments for the screen at night. Wakes up too often with the display coming back on and staying on. And no way to automatically turn off the display during set times. The \"do not disturb\" function doesn't really cover enough."},{"reviewerName":"Dan Curb","rating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"FORCED “Things to try...” CANNOT TURN OFF! FIX THIS PRODUCT AMAZON.","reviewDate":"September 30, 2019","reviewText":"The fact that Amazon forces you to view “things to try” and there is not a non-workaround way to turn them off is maddening. Basically “Try, BLAH BLAH BLAH...” will randomly pop up on your Echo Show 5. There are ways to cut them down, but NOT to eliminate them. I wanted a clock that would do a couple of more cool things like lightning control and weather. Now I have a ROTATING AMAZON BILLBOARD. I don’t want to try ANY of your suggestions Alexa... I just want my clock to be a CLOCK. I don’t need ANYTHING else displayed, unless I program it or ask for it. Amazon could turn this off easily, but so far they have refused. They are hoping this blows over and we just “live with it”. Be vocal and call in to Amazon so they fix this. Otherwise, they will just force you to accept popups on your alarm clock. This item was RUSH released to be available for Prime Day. It was simply not ready for Prime Time. Wait to buy until these stupid prompts are removed.\n\nWill update if the prompts are removed and give it 4. It can’t have 5 because while you can connect any Bluetooth speaker to your Echo, you can only make an “Amazon recognized” Bluetooth speaker your “preferred speaker”. This means only preferred speakers can be designated in your speaker groups. So when I play music “everywhere” it auto disconnects from my $1k+ Soundbar in favor of the Echo Show 5 speaker. While using speaker groups, there is no way I know of to make it manually connect because it prefers the Echo device. Amazon is forcing you to buy their authorized devices to make this feature work.\n\nAmazon is a great company so it is kind of sad that they are doing these kind of monopoly moves.

But watching videos on the small screen is a bit of a nuisance for wikihow and prime video but that being said I enjoyed throwing a movie to have it in the background while I did stuff around the house. The privacy shutter is a great addition and the variety of clock faces is very nice and they are full screen clocks which was a big gripe for the full sized show for many. In my opinion it's well worth it to update any echo dots you have for one of these instead and it's definitely more appealing than the echo spot (although I still love my echo spot) and it's much cheaper than the spot.

As I'm learning to use Alexa I'm liking it more and more. It's nice to be able to turn on my lights with my voice! I can see this quickly becoming a great tool to use for so many things.\n\nHowever, I am going to echo everyone's gripe I've read. The slideshow as the home page has GOT TO GO. It's distracting, it's annoying and I wish there was a way to stop it. I'm hopeful Amazon will listen to the complaints and do something to change this. I haven't dug into it but I'm curious if there's a way to force night mode on it?\n\nOverall its a solid device save for one quibble with it.\n\nETA: I mostly got it to stop. Go to settings, home & clock, home content and turn EVERYTHING off. The clock will rotate once to a \"try alexa\" screen but then stay static on the clock of your choice. Took a bit of back and forth to get it to stick but it's SO MUCH BETTER than the constant slideshow."},{"reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Enjoying my Echo Show 5!","reviewDate":"November 4, 2019","reviewText":"I have enjoyed my Show 5. I have it on my desk in my office. I enjoy the rolling news stories and the weather updates. I mainly use it to listen to music, podcasts, audio books. I like that some of the \"skills\" allow to display the lyrics. The speaker is great and is the primary reason I purchased this unit.\n\nCons:\n1. I do not like the suggestions of what to ask Alexa to do. You can not turn them off. That should be an option for the user. For this I take away one star.\n\n2. There are a limited amount of skills that utilize the screen. YouTube should have it's on skill. I can use the browser to go to YouTube but if I need to stop for any reason I have to go all the back in. For this another star deducted.\n\nI wish the user had the ability to add shortcuts, or app icons particular skills on the home screen (like YouTube, a web link, photo album, or playlist)\n\nI'm sure the skills and ability will grow with time. But right now it's not that much more useful than the regular Echo."},{"reviewerName":"Las Vegas Don","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Potential live video communication","reviewDate":"September 18, 2019","reviewText":"I was recently gifted an Echo, and in becoming familiar with all that can be done with Alexa and the other smart accessories, I was interested in the possibility of live video communication with family members that live in other cities and states. I purchased an Echo Show 5 to gain further experience with the equipment. Subsequently, Amazon had a flash sale on Echo Show 5's at half price and based on my favorable impressions with the first one, I ordered a second one. I am using one in my office and one in the kitchen. They were very easy and quick to set up. The quality of the picture and operation have been excellent. I set up the home screen to show my photos which is a nice touch. Voice operation has also been perfect. My only issue has been the sensitivity of the touch screen. On a few occasions, it has not been responsive until two to three tries, and on one or two times, I have had to leave the screen and then return to the screen to complete the operation. I have not yet completed a video call, but will when family members obtain compatible equipment."},{"reviewerName":"Roger","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Awesome addition to the Echo product line","reviewDate":"July 17, 2019","reviewText":"I've used the original Echo for several years. It's getting a little beat up, but still works well and has very good sound.\nI wanted a Video Echo to support other video devices, such as the Ring Video Doorbell. When the price dropped for Amazon Prime Day, I jumped on this deal. So I will retire the original Echo to another lesser used room.\nThe Echo Show 5 is my 6th Echo device, if we count the FireTV Cube. So, I am familiar with the setup. But I was not prepared for how easy this one is to set up. Plug in, answer a few questions and good to go! I've watched a movie (Prime), listened to music, did a Drop In, all the great stuff! I do recommend using the Smart Phone app to easily rename the Show something shorter and easy to remember.\nNow, I may need to start upgrading from the Dots to more Shows for other rooms. And, of course for gifts, so I can drop in with the family.\nI'm definitely happy with this purchase and recommend it for others."},{"reviewerName":"Wesley Henry","rating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great Product with ONE Big Flaw!","reviewDate":"September 29, 2019","reviewText":"I really do like my new Echo Show 5. The functionality of the device is what I expected. The ease of use is like many other Amazon products. My biggest complaint, if you can call it that, is the \"Try Alexa...\" rotation when the Show 5 is in Clock mode. When it detects motion, the Show 5 puts the time, date, and weather up in the upper left-hand corner, blanks out the screen, and shows a suggestion of what to try to get Alexa to do. This feature is annoying and it almost makes this smart device really dumb. If this were able to be turned off, I'd give it five stars hands down. I followed all the suggested fixes for this issue and none of them seem to work at all. This needs to be fixed and I would say it is one of the best products on the market."},{"reviewerName":"The Engineer Critic","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Annoying \"Try this\" messages","reviewDate":"August 13, 2019","reviewText":"I just wanted to use this as an Alarm Clock, but note that there is no way to disable the annoying \"Try this...\" suggestion messages (which cause the clock display to be minimized). I disabled all of the annoying \"Home Content\" but later asked a food question and suddenly \"Popular Recipes\" got magically re-enabled, causing random recipes to appear whenever I turn the light on (see attached photo). I turned it back off, but be careful what you ask for... Alexa's voice is also too bassy in the bathroom (there is an equalizer but it only affects Amazon Music).\n\nUpdate 10/2019: The latest automatic firmware update seems to have broken the font color on the \"Watercolor\" display background. The time display is now intermittently red instead of white (see photo). In addition, on some days the full-size clock display doesn't appear at all and instead I just get a minimized clock display and continuous back-to-back \"Try this\" messages on the screen the ENTIRE day.

I'm impressed with the Echo show 5 and it currently is being used as a replacement for my Echo spot. It can do everything it's larger echo show devices can do on a smaller more compact screen. It doesn't take up much real estate on my night stand and looks stylish. What I like about this device over the spot is the sound quality is much better. I can take advantage of a full screen instead of a round one. At night the device goes in to a low light mode with just red numbers similar to a traditional alarm clock. I no longer have to tell my device to turn the screen off. I like the sunrise alarm feature where the show 5 gradually emits a warm orangish glow imitating natural sun light as the alarm clock gradually wakes me up, instead of waking up in a startle to a loud blaring sound. I've never been a fan of video chatting, but the fact that there is a shutter that blocks the camera is a nice feature for rhose worried about awkward drop ins in the bedroom. Mine stays on at all times."},{"reviewerName":"MJ","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Love it even though it has one design flaw - no battery backup.","reviewDate":"July 2, 2019","reviewText":"Love the Show 5. Use mine as a nightstand alarm clock, ring doorbell/cam display center, and for music. The one design limitation I do find is there is no battery backup, so it’s use as an alarm clock is only as dependable as your power source. I guess you could plug it into a UPS, but would it have been so hard to build in a battery backup that would at least keep the alarm clock feature active during a power or internet outage?"},{"reviewerName":"Florida Clay","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"A great addition to my Echo fleet","reviewDate":"July 9, 2019","reviewText":"I have an Echo household, with one in every room. The show makes a nice edition. I wanted mainly to be able to see who is at the door via my Ring doorbell from my usual living room seat some distance from the door. It performs that function well, in addition to the normal Echo functions. I keep noticing nice little features, such as when I give a command to turn on a light the control for that light shows up on the screen with a brightness adjustment slider. When I ask Alexa where my stuff is, I get the usual audio report plus a picture of what's coming. There are videos you can watch, etc. It is just a nice little gadget."},{"reviewerName":"armlabes","rating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Time to weigh in on this device","reviewDate":"August 24, 2019","reviewText":"Now that I have owned the Echo Show 5 for a while, I thought it might be a good time to weigh in on the device, especially since it now sits on a shelf in my closet. I was kind of enthusiastic about getting it, and saw it as a replacement for my Echo Spot, which sits on my night table. With a larger, more conventional screen and a promised uptick in speaker power, I felt that it would be a better fit, though I was not at all dissatisfied with the Spot, which has proven to be the most useful of all my Echo devices (which include Fire tablets, a Dot, a Fire TV Cube, and a 2nd Generation Echo Plus).\n\nI suppose that ones appreciation for the Echo Show 5 will be affected by intended use. While I was satisfied with the devices visual performance, ultimately the device audio turned out to be the deal breaker. The thing sounds awful, on a par with my 1st generation Echo Dot. I spent days tooling around with the EQ settings trying to raise it to satisfactory levels, but was unsuccessful. I actually sent the device back for a replacement, thinking that I received a defective device, only to have the second one arrive sounding exactly the same.\n\nNow, keep in mind that I didn't use the device much for music, and was not expecting high fidelity symphonic reproduction. Mainly, audio is for my communications with Alexa and the occasional podcast before falling asleep. I think it highly unlikely that I receive two devices with the exact same defect, and have concluded that audio is simply problematic on this device.\n\nI eventually returned my Echo Spot to the night table, because its sound reproduction is 10 times fuller and more pleasant than the Show 5. Perhaps I was expecting too much, as the Show 5 is priced significantly lower than the Spot. Keep in mind, however, that in the Echo lineup, the Spot, which I am now using, is not a high end audio device. But it is a lot better than the Echo Show 5, which I now regret purchasing, despite the larger screen."},{"reviewerName":"La Jolla Library User","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Exactly what I wanted","reviewDate":"July 13, 2019","reviewText":"As soon as I saw a photo of this new product, I knew that it would be a perfect device for my bedroom. I also have the Echo Show 2nd generation, but that larger device has migrated to my home office. The Echo Show 5 was easier to set up and connected more quickly to my wi-fi network than earlier models. It turns off my Hue lights, dims to a night mode, wakes me with a custom alarm and tells me my appointments for the day. I bought this Show at a local electronics store rather than on Amazon because I had a store credit.

I got rid of my old alarm clock and had been using my echo to wake me up but hated not being able to actually see the time (you know when you wake up in the middle of the night and want to know how much sleep you can get if you fall asleep right NOW). I did not want to spend a lot of money on a dot or a show. When this came up in my recommendations I was interested. When i was $40 off on prime day I decided to give it a try. I love it.\nThe sound quality is good, the size is perfect and now I only have one item on my nightstand.\nThe screen adjusts to the light in the room so it is not GLOWING at 2am and it performs all of the functions that my echos and dots around the house do.

You can watch videos on it. You can either ask Alexa to open Silk browser and browse the internet and watch YouTube or just use the intergrated app to watch Amazon videos. To be honest, I almost never find myself doing this at all. Instead, the screen is nice for looking up recipes or Lyrics. That being said, the screen is more than capable than you need.\n\n2. Camera. The camera can be physically closed so it is definitely safer than some other products. But keep in mind that the camera is only “functional”, not amazing. This is understandable and doesn’t bother me at all, I tried video chat on this thing and it works just fine.\n\n3. Sound quality. As a 1st gen echo dot owner, I must say the new echo devices have some great sound quality improvement. Volume can also be loud for you to hear the m suicide from any corner of the room.\n\nOverall, I say an echo dot/ echo can pretty much do anything that the echo show can do and you won’t be missing a whole lot.

The best thing about it is you can block the camera so I use it in the bedroom. My only small beef is I call it Echo instead of Alexa (my Fire TV Cube is Alexa) and it does not always pick me up the first time.\n\nIf you want to buy an Echo 5, wait for the price to drop again (and buy the holder, it really helps.)"},{"reviewerName":"Ali","rating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Basically a glorified clock. An ok product which needs improvement","reviewDate":"October 14, 2019","reviewText":"Basically it’s an ok product.\n\nWhen I use the echo show 5 Alexa sometimes has a hard time understanding my commands. Additionally unless you give very specific commands as listed by amazon she won’t understand variations of phrases, like Siri or bixby might. It would seem in order to get her to do what I want I have to memorize commands even if I’m one word off form what the command is is really ridiculous.\n\nAlso the App Store or in this case Alexa skills is limited and needs great improvement. Many skills don’t work or aren’t really good to begin with. For the skills that developers are asking money for is crazy. One skill wanted you to pay by the HOUR to use. Unbelievable. When you want to use an app Alexa will talk a lot. I feel like saying I just want to use the skill not have you ask me a lot of questions.\n\nThe device is also limited to apps it can link to so no YouTube and other apps you may be use to utilizing on other smart devices. At the very least it pairs to Pandora, Gmail, and Skype which are good functions I would use this particular device.\n\nAlso on Alexa app which you need to use with the echo show, the menus offered are a bit disorganized. It should be more intuitive how to use and get around the menus when first using the device. I’m use to apple where everything is simplified and you know how to use the iPhone or iPad easily the first time. It took me a while to figure out how to work and personalized the device to my needs having to watch YouTube videos and read articles. I don’t want to do extensive research when first using a device, that should be reserved more unique features, not just to perform simple functions.\n\nI also saw YouTube videos previous to the purchase that said the speaker was great. The speaker is actually pretty lousy I’m surprised they even said that. Of course you can always connect via Bluetooth to a speaker.\n\nThe display of the echo itself is beautiful and it is cool how when you turn off the light in your room the echo show will display a night version of the clock. I also like how you can make personalized questions and answers.\n\nIt’s good as a digital display clock to check weather and make alarms, reminders, even recipes as it advertised but otherwise don’t have your expectations too high for such an device. I don’t think it’s worth the $84 or whatever asking price. Sometimes amazon has a sale on this device which is when I feel it’s more worth it. Although I personally believe a device that is so limited and has much room for improve is worth closer to $40-50.\n\nIf you’re ok with what I discussed above. With the echo show being a digital clock with a few little quirks than it may be the device for you"},{"reviewerName":"Jenajaw","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Kids Routines","reviewDate":"September 25, 2019","reviewText":"I absolutely love this Echo Show 5! It's exactly what I was looking for and a bit more. I have 3 kids, 2 of which are in school. My husband and I work full time plus some- his schedule is the same, but mine varies. We also live with his mother, which is fantastic, as she help out with the kids when our shifts overlap. Our life can get pretty crazy around here. I'm an organized person and like schedules and consistency. I was having a hard time getting the other 2 adults on board with my schedules for the kids, as well as having difficulty keeping the kids accountable for tasks they could accomplish themselves. My oldest is autistic as well, so he needs schedules and consistency, or he has some meltdowns and life gets more crazy for all. We were having problems with getting ready for school on time. They walk to school and I wanted them to learn how to be ready and leave on time, in case I had to work early and no one else was up to guide them out the door. Bedtime has been a struggle for a few months now- afraid of the dark, too early, ect. (I did buy a weighted blanket for my autistic child and that helped too)\nWhat I needed:\n-a bedroom clock with alarm for each of the kids' room\n-a night light\n-a schedule\n-some way of letting the kids know what needed to be done when\n-didn't want to spend tons of money, but was willing to spend some to get my sanity back\n\nI got it all plus an intercom with video! Bonus!!!\nAll access to each device on my phone! Bonus!!!\n\nI bought 3 Echo Show 5s. One for each kid room and one for down stairs. I set up my whole schedule for them- morning, afterschool, and bedtime routines under the routine setting. It took awhile to set up- and I had to set up the same routine for each device I wanted to play it on (I did all the devices the same, since I didn't know where my children would be when the routine went off) I was nervous that there was going to be an alarm that went off on all the devices at the same time, but Alexa just says what I they need to do and the words show up on the screen too and then it goes back to what ever was going on (clock, youtube, ect)\nThe first day, I woke up to the kids getting dressed on their own. The morning proceeded without yelling, or arguing. My autistic child was even ahead of schedule at one point and told Alexa he already completed the task. They were off to school on time. When the evening came around, my mother in law had the kids, as I was at work. Same thing, no arguments about chores, bedtime, or homework. Alexa being the one to set the schedule took the arguing away. The kids knew what they needed to do and they did it.\nI love that I can easily change and update the routines on my phone.\nI love that I can drop in or announce something to any or all of the devices.\nI love that it also communicates with my echo dot in my room.\nI love that I can use it as a baby monitor for my youngest.\nI love that all 3 adults can access the Alexa app on our phones and communicate with the kids."},{"reviewerName":"Mdspurbe","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Perfect bedside Smart Speaker!!","reviewDate":"August 16, 2019","reviewText":"Perfect size!

I ordered two of them for two of my daughters and received one. The order got changed to only one of the bundles without and explanation. I contacted customer service and spent better than 30 minutes explaining to them what happened and trying to convince them that I actually did order two of the bundles. Of course they asked me if I had a screen shot of my order showing two were ordered, never occurred to me that I needed to do this. Oh and they had extracted some gift card money from my account that I didn't want to use for this order but nothing could be done about that either. I couldn't order another of the bundle because it wasn't being offered any longer. Finally I disconnected from the chat because I realized I was wasting my time with the so-called customer service support. Then I get a message from customer service asking if I could just order the individual items and they would return the price difference to me as a gift card amount. I placed the order for both devices and got back in to the chat where I was told that they couldn't do anything for me because the bundle was one per customer. Now wouldn't you think that would of been mentioned on the web page and just \"maybe\" they would of changed the number ordered field so you could change the number ordered from 1 to a higher number? Maybe even pop up a window when you tried explaining that it was one per customer? How long has Amazon been doing this? So I had to go back in and cancel the order customer service just asked me to place.\nI've been a very good customer of Amazon (both at work and at home) but this has not made me a happy customer.\nI'm pretty sure this review will never get posted on the Amazon site so I'll make a copy of it and spread it around.\nAmazon you need to get your act together.

Dorbell cam screen? Recipie lister?","reviewDate":"August 31, 2019","reviewText":"This Show 5 is basically made to go on a bedside table and be used as a voice activated alarm clock, but that's not how it's advertised. Even if you used it that way, it's not really that good.\n\nI have a *lot* of \"Alexa\" stuff... Echos, Dots, an auto, and a couple of Fire 4K sticks. I love them all (auto's a different story), but the Show 5 is pretty disappointing.\n\nI have dot in my living room that I use all the time for smart home lights and music. My intent was to replace the dot with the S5 so that I could see my cameras in addition to everything I already do... but it's not a \"Dot with a screen\". The far field voice recognition is awful. Placed 10 feet away the S5 ignores me quite a bit, and instead the dot from 25 feet away in another side room answers. It's very frustrating to be randomly answered by a dot in the other room. That never happened with the dot in the same place.\n\nAlso the sound quality is not great. No sweat, you can pair it to a Bluetooth speaker. Unfortunately, in that that configuration it disconnects from the speaker whenever you use it in a music group and you're stuck back with the poor quality sound again. Again, the dot is a workhorse and happily plays music through the Bluetooth speaker while in a group.\n\nMy \"solution\" is to but the dot back and change the S5's wake word to echo and us it for the sole purpose of looking at cameras. It's OK for that, but not for the price. Also, Amazon really needs to think up some better wake words. In my house the words \"computer\" and \"Amazon\" get used multiple times in a day. I'm sure they'd have a legal battle with \"OK Amazon\" but I'm also sure they have a lot of smart employees that could figure it out.\n\nSo basically, I have a mini camera screen and clock that doesn't play well with any of the other \"Alexa\" devices. , sounds poor, and doesn't understand me.

I need this because I am a sole caregiver and need to monitor the patient constantly. I would have givens them 5 stars if I was only interested in a high-end alarm clock and needed to ask stupid questions like how to boil an egg. As monitors, they fail miserably. Connections can be made to all my Arlo cameras but the viewing lasts anywhere from a minute to 15 minutes before we're back at the home screen with no warning. Checking user group posts, this has been a problem for years that neither Amazon or Arlo is doing anything to fix it. So, I though I'd waste a little more money and try a Wyze Cam Pan thinking it might not have the problem. It's exactly the same as for the Arlo cams.

The design looks sleek, the different clock faces are awesome - excellent way to incorporate Alexa on a shelf. It does what Alexa/Echo devices do, so I don't try to let the Echo/Alexa ecosystem affect my impression of an Alexa product. If you like Alexa, you'll like this unit. This does everything my Gen 1 Echo Tower did, both the good and the bad.\n\nThere are definite pluses to having a screen - we got this at the same time as my parents so our kids can 'drop in' on Grandma and vice-versa. If you have kids and the grandparents are several states away, this is reason enough to buy this device. Other pluses are the ability to ask to \"show the Porch\" or \"show me the backyard\" to see my Ring camera displays. Awesome.\nThe calendar integration is nice - it doesn't do enough to be the 'home dashboard' I would want. I would love to pull in backgrounds from a defined Google Photos album (sorry, Amazon hates Google) and be able to define what shows on the screen at all times. Instead, I get Amazon ads. They are unobtrusive, but still a bit annoying that Amazon gets more say over what I can show on the device I BOUGHT to put in MY HOUSE than I do. Amazon still has a bit of \"we are not an evil empire\" work to do.\n\nFor all it does well, there are things it definitely does not do well. If I want to see one of my cameras, I need to ASK Alexa to show the device. I would rather have the screen just pop up and show my Ring cameras when they detect motion. It's more of a feature request, but having the ability to show which camera when motion is detected would make me buy at least 3 more Echo Show type units without hesitation. Right now, everything has to be a prompt. I would love to not have to rely on my phone to notify me, then call out to Alexa to show me the camera. Frankly, it's a waste of a solid ecosystem.\nAdditionally, The Echo Show doesn't seem to know it has a screen all the time. \"Alexa, play Baby Shark\" won't play the Baby Shark video off YouTube. It will play the Baby Shark song from my library. Try explaining to a 2-year-old why the screen in front of her is not showing her the Baby Shark video on the 700th time she's asked for it. #ThanksAmazon\n\nThe angle of the screen is an issue. You can buy a stand for it, but I really shouldn't have to. Amazon should have thought about this. Everything else about the Echo Show 5 screams 'really well thought out design' except for the angle. Setting it on an end table? Video calls will be annoying. Looking at anything is straining. It's a 5-inch screen. Bigger screens would be much better, but for what the Echo Shows offer it's not worth the cost of the bigger screen currently. Add a few more features and customization and get over yourself and allow Google integration as well as some other things and it would be worth it. There are ways to turn a Fire Tablet into a glorified Echo Show with a dock, and I think that may be a better option unless you care about sound quality. The Echo Show 5 does have excellent sound quality which puts the gen 1 Echo tower to shame.\n\nEcho devices keep improving, so changes are I will buy another larger Echo Show in the future. But I want the ability to see all my smart home devices and tap to control so I don't have to speak. Can I see all my smart lights? Nope. Not on the screen. I can on the app on my phone but not the screen. Amazon is SO CLOSE to having a true 'Smart Home Hub' but they seem to be held back behind the want to show ads and restrict content from Google. Amazon needs to realize that playing nice with others will get them further than trying to force the ecosystem. and make these devices so much better than what they are currently."},{"reviewerName":"Gary","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Security cameras monitor failure","reviewDate":"November 6, 2019","reviewText":"This is a case of,\"I got exactly what I asked for, but not what I wanted\". I wanted to view security cameras on this, but even tho there is a skill for both my brand cameras, neither system works with the Show. It must be understood that only a system that is especially designed to work with these, will work. Most aren't. So, if your brand camera or system is listed, it may not be compatible. Mine aren't. And they are brand names. So my inteñded purpose failed. I already had the Dot, now basically have two Dots, but one has a screen. It's like having a smart phone that you must leave plugged in, without ability to add apps. We love our Dot, and use it a lot. The Show responds well to us, but we don't have much use for the screen now that we can't see the security cameras. Questions we ask, we don't need to \"see\" the answer, just listen to the verbal response given. The Show has a little more bass sound than the Dot. The Show software is a little buggy. Even as a clock, it's so annoying when \"Try this\" resets the screen each time it kicks in. And, yes, I have all screen content turned off and it still runs \"Things to try\". And the date comes and goes on face. Sometimes it's there, sometimes it's not. The built in camera, along with the Drop In feature may be useful sometime as a sorta nanny cam. The Show has a lot of features that work well for their intended purposes. They just need to stop forcing\"Things to try\" on customers. It's really a useless feature that if was included on the smart screen radio of their next new car, would really really really tick them off. I won't purchase new security cameras that DO work with the Show for now. So for me, I am disappointed only in that respect (and the Things to try force). It depends on your needs and wants as to whether I would recommend this to you. So that would be a yes and no. It's a good unit for what it does.

The one thing I am disappointed about is the quality of the camera, even for this 1 MP is very low and makes dropping in with someone almost pointless (not that I'll be using that feature all that much). Other than that, the sound quality is good, videos look great and play with no issues, it was easy to set up, and I've been using it every day so far. Also, do not listen to the reviews saying you can't turn the scrolling or \"things to try\" off, it's easily turned off by going to the settings on the device itself.\n\nAgain, remember you are getting a smaller more affordable version of the show.

Ok you daffy machine - you use the internet to do your voice recognition. Hard to believe it's down. It would be nice to have the machine be able to run a self diagnostic. My only cure for the \"no internet\" is to reboot it. Then miraculously it has internet again. Mind you nothing else in the house (and I have over 20 different devices connected) has issues.\nAnother irritating thing is the constant little prompts to make it do tricks. Hey Amazon - gimme an option to turn this crap off. Most of the \"tricks\" don't even work. You read it directly off the screen and it says \"I don't know how to do that\". It's already annoying that you ask me to try it but then you say \"whut?\" - aggravating like Lucy pulling the football away from Charlie Brown.\nAnother one. Alarms. Trying to phrase it just right is tricky. I found setting it in the app is much less hassle.\nSo you decide to sleep in or it's a holiday. \"Alexa, cancel alarm tomorrow morning\". It says ok then every single time it asks if you want to delete the entire series. It would be great if Amazon could teach Alexa the word \"just\" - \"Alexa, turn off JUST tomorrow morning alarm\".

Sound and Voice recognition review","reviewDate":"August 28, 2019","reviewText":"There's other more in depth reviews on what it can do, but I'm be reviewing the sound, voice recognition and screen. Of course having a screen is a big plus, but I find it small at times being only 5 inches. That's what she said!\n\nSound:\n\nA step up above the Eco Dot 2nd generation I replaced. But it still only has 1 speaker so sound is in mono, not stereo. However, the one speaker is louder and has more bass. Since this is in my kitchen, I often listen to music while I cook or wash dishes. Music in Mono sounds like crap. So I've plugged a stereo Bluetooth speaker via the aux outlet .\n\nWhy did I plug it instead of connecting to Bluetooth? Because Alexa can't go into \"follow up\" mode if it's Bluetooth connected to a speaker. BUT it can if you use the aux cord. Follow up mode is when you ask Alexa a question and it listens to hear a follow up question. This is very helpful at times. For example; \"where's the nearest Pizza Hut?\" then follow up and say \"Call them\" instead of saying \"Alexa\" twice. Even though the one speaker sounds better, what use is it if it's plugged into a better sounding dual speaker stereo?\n\nVoice Recognition:\n\nIt picks up my voice good, but I found that the Echo Dot was better. It could pick up my voice from across the room but the Echo Show 5 missed my voice about 30% of the time. I can live with it because now I just walk closer to it.\n\nScreen:\n\nWhen playing music, it displays the lyrics. When listening to the news, it displays video. When asking for weather, it also shows it on the screen. This is very helpful. BUT since it's in my kitchen and I move around a lot, cooking or cleaning, I'm often too far away to see what's on the screen. How can it be useful if it can't be seen? Being that it's a touch screen is nice though. At 5 inches, its too small. I mean even my phone has a 6 inch screen.\n\nFinal thoughts:\n\nI would've never bought this at $90 but on Prime day, I got it for $25 after trading in my Echo Dot 2nd generation. The screen is helpful but unless you're using it as a night stand clock, it's almost useless as it's too small. I could have used my 8 inch Fire tablet as an Alexa device instead. It can act like an Echo Show in \"Show mode.\"\n\nOverall, 4 stars. Slightly better speaker, but slightly worse voice recognition, has a screen."},{"reviewerName":"Jen Si","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Good alexa integration, fair sound, annoying sleep timer and \"try this\" ads on screen","reviewDate":"July 23, 2019","reviewText":"Unboxed this today and found it to be sleek and modern looking.\n\nLiked that I could customize the home page a bit, putting a personal photo on. Very easy to set up to WiFi, then it took about 5 minutes or so to update itself and it was then ready for use.\n\nSound is fair. Not as good as my original Alexa, and if you are using this primarily for speaker, I'd say move on. Fine for a casual listener, though. To be fair, I do not have the stand, which may affect the way it sounds. There is an equalizer to play with and that does help from the standard settings.\n\nSleep function is annoying and not changeable as far as I have read. After 10 minutes, if you are not touching the screen, the home screen will return, so if you are using it to follow a recipe, for example, that could get annoying.\n\nThe \"Ads\" (ie, \"Try this feature\") will go around one time, then you can stop them in the settings. It is annoying that they must show once, but it's not a deal breaker for me.\n\nVoice recognition is very fast and accurate and I enjoy the visual feedback.\n\nVideo playback (as in searching for and playing video) is powered by Bing, so be prepared to not get the official music video, but rather whatever the top result is.\n\nIt does integrate with calendars from different platforms, (ie apple), but when I asked for when my Dr. Smith appointment was, she said she couldn't find it. It was displaying at the time. So there needs to be some work done there.\n\nThe display is crisp and bright, and I do like the way it looks.\n\nOverall, for a small speaker that shows me the weather, time and date and plays some music, it does a good job and looks nice."},{"reviewerName":"Michelle Bullock","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great portable version of the Show 10.

I wanted to use the Echo Show 5 as a replacement for my bedside alarm. It functions perfectly as an Alexa device to play music, turn on smart plugs, etc. What sold me on an Echo Show 5 was the manual shutter for the camera. I could care less about devices recording my voice but potentially recording video is another issue.\n\nSetting up an alarm is relatively simple by asking Alexa or manually setting up the alarm through the menu. However, there are some limitations. I want to wake up to my Pandora radio station but this cannot be setup manually, instead, you must instruct Alexa to set this up verbally. Another limitation is the lack of physical buttons such as a snooze, alarm 1, alarm 2, on/off button. Many times I've attempted to dismiss the alarm by swiping up on the screen only to have triggered snooze by accident (this is a little frustrating first thing in the morning). I personally would appreciate Amazon integrating some physical buttons where I can customize their functions.\n\nThe only other issue would be the constant ribbons instructing me to try this or try that but this is a well-known issue discussed in other reviews.\n\nOverall, this is a nice device with a clear screen. If you are using for anything other than an alarm clock I would say go for it. Needless to say, I have returned to my old radio alarm clock. Hopefully in the future Amazon will offer a dedicated bedside alarm clock or refine the Show with some physical buttons."},{"reviewerName":"Andrew Murray","rating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Screen Runs Hot & Interface Is Weak","reviewDate":"August 7, 2019","reviewText":"This product isn't necessary, especially for someone that doesn't utilize the video call features. Honestly, I'm not sure that I can access the full Amazon Prime video library through this product. Maybe if I knew what I wanted to watch, I could call up the title, but that's rarely the case with streaming. Similar to the Netflix search void, Amazon's black hole is significantly worse because 1) their options are weak and uninspiring (beyond The Boys) and 2) the user interface and design are still the worst in the game. I don't know why I purchased this. Maybe it's because I like asking about the weather and playing the occasional game of Jeopardy. The constant scrolling recommendations isn't my idea of fun, though, nor is a screen that feels like a car hood sitting out in the mid-summer sun. I don't know if my product is defective, but I actually fear keeping it on every day. If I'm out of the house for more than a weekend, I pull the plug. I honestly believe this product to be a fire hazard and I'm genuinely shocked that this is safe for households. Bottom line: you don't actually need this.

Bought one 1st for my daughter and she loved it, and just now bought a 2nd one for my own room. Newer software and compatibility with other smart devises makes it a breeze to set up home automation. My original Echo Show was already set up to my Ecobee smart thermostat. I bought smart LED lightbulbs for the kitchen and 2 plain non-color changing bulbs for the master bedroom. Setting up the lightbulbs was pretty easy and once I got them setup with any one of the Echo(s), there was nothing I needed to do with any of the other Echo shows. We used to leave our cell phones plugged in and on all night as an alarm clock, now we just tell Alexa to wake us up every morning and turn our phones off. We have Amazon music for the whole house and both our daughters and us now lie in our own rooms listening to our favorite songs as we go to sleep. No more fiddling with a bunch of buttons, just \"Alexa play\" and the name of the song or \"Alexa wake us up at\". It is that easy. \"Alexa turn on the Kitchen\" or \"Alexa, turn on Master Bedroom #1\". They are also compatible with and connected to my Arlo Pro security cameras, however I'm still not impressed with how they work together, and believe it to be a flaw with both Arlo and the Echo software. If you are going to get them just for compatibility with security cameras, then I would not recommend them, but if you want to use them as alarm clock, music/media players, intercoms, thermostat controls, and as a hub for a lot of your smart devices then definitely well worth the money. I don't know anything about home automation and had a professional company come out at quote quite a bit more that I wanted to pay and could afford. A few years later, with these new Echos and minor changes in wifi and bluetooth smart devises, I got all the same functions the pros were quoting at less than a 4th of the price that I installed myself.."},{"reviewerName":"Benjamin L.

At that moment you speak Alexa answer the front door. The mic is turned on and you can speak to them and see who it is. Lastly you can ask it to show the video from the front door. We love it and plan to buy more. FYI - You need to add the Ring skill to the Echo Show 5 for this to work.\n\nNow regarding the other aspects of the Show. We use it to play music from Prime. It also allows adding skills so it will read to you or work with other smart devices. You can change the screen to display pictures, weather or stock price. You can add more if needed or delete.

Apparently I have been spoiled with Google Assistant on my phone and a Google Home Mini because using Alexa has been nothing but problems. It hardly recognizes my commands, often plays the wrong songs or searches for the wrong things and freezes up when switching from one task to the next (say going from Prime Video to Spotify). Even as a simple clock, Amazon would rather waste screentime telling me what I can search for or minimizing the time and weather to a small corner of the screen. It's honestly very frustrating to use and I truly recommend folks stick with Siri or Google because Alexa isn't ready for primetime. It does some things right like the weather or play Prime Videos clearly but for everything else it's a frustrating mess of a device. It's now relegated to the bathroom because it's too annoying to keep anywhere where you'd use it more often. I got the Echo Show 5 as a test of the Alexa eco-system and now I will be running right back to Google.

It is at best 2 stars for this. Why?\n\n1) Alarms. If you dismiss a non-repeating alarm you have to reenter it.\n2) Alarms. There is no way on the Show to have a list of alarm times (like google hub has) and select the one you want to enable. You can do this in the app, but that is many extra steps. Why not mirror the App alarm list on the show?\n3) Alarms. Tapping anywhere on the show causes the alarm to snooze. you must swipe up to dismiss. Very unnatural when being awakened by the alarm. My Goole phone presents two buttons on the screen, Dismiss, and snooze.\n4) Alarms. To turn it on, you must slide out, select Alarms, then enter the alarm time. Not exactly a time saver from flipping a switch on my dumb clock (which ahs multiple alarm times).\n5) Night Display. Almost unreadable. The screen glows gray from the backlighting, then there is red lettering that can only be read from straight on. That means I must raise my head up to see the time.\n\nI do like the weather display, integration to my outlook schedule (something google does not do), and integration to my Smartthings smart house.\n\nThe lack of good alarm clock integration will likely have me taking it back to the store.\n\nUpdate: I downgraded from 3 to 2 stars because of a new Alarm problem. There is no way from the Show 5 to cancel an upcoming alarm from the device without using voice. You can only do it from your phone. For me, the phone is on the other side of the house. So that leaves me with a choice when I wake up before my alarm. Lie there until it goes off, get up, walk across a dark house, and turn it off from my phone, or wake my sleeping wife. None of these are good choices. Why can't I turn it off from the Alarms screen????"},{"reviewerName":"Steve-O-Mite","rating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Alexa has developed a lisp & other audio distortion issues","reviewDate":"August 21, 2019","reviewText":"Update 9/28/2019\nThe new unit they sent me doesn't have the audio issues anymore, but now there is a display issue. For a while I could see the large clock on the home screen. Now it just gives me the small clock (not the one I selected) and tells me to try stuff. I have all the rotation and content disabled and I cannot get it to show the large clock without the suggestions.\n\nPrevious review\nOther review will tell you about the other pros/cons of this unit. But many of us are having audio issues. Intermittently, Alexa sounds very distorted in the high frequencies, so the S’s are annoying loud. Just sounds like something is fried inside. Music played via bluetooth also can sound this way, and sometimes the volume jumps up super high (like trying to fall asleep white noise played via bluetooth). These things make it unusable for me.\n\nCustomer service said they have never had this issue reported. But I even found it on an Amazon forum and in the product reviews. They wanted me to send it in for “inspection” that would take 2 weeks. After some negotiating they finally agreed to send me a new unit and waived the “whatever extra service” fee. I am very skeptical that the new unit will not have the same issue. I’ll update this review after I get it.\n\nHere are some of the ways other customers reported the same issue:\n\n-there were multiple times when I started to get something similar to static from the device, kind of a distortion. It made Alexa sound like she had a lisp, and music was noticeably distorted.\n\n-The biggest issue with the Echo Show 5 was sound distortion - random and intermittent.\n\n-Recently after listening to music, radio or Spotify for a few minutes I notice distorted sibilance on speech and music. It is as though high frequencies are severely distorted. The only solution to stopping it was to unplug and restart the echo. It was then fine for a while but has started to do the same again.\n\n-Sound is fine for a time but then starts to distort.\n\n-I have had this happen a few times during night while I have it playing Rain Sounds while we sleep.

There was a promotion where I got two of them for $70, so at roughly $35 each, that felt like a much more reasonable price.\n\nI've found voice controlling things with it to be a bit finicky. I had to disable an Alexa skill for my TV since any time I tried to play something on it, it would by default try to play it on my TV, and then say it couldn't do it.\n\nNavigating videos takes some practice unless you want to use the touch screen to scroll through things.\n\nI really wish I could use services like Plex and Vudu on it. As of writing this, Amazon Prime seems to be the main video source (no surprise). If I say something like \"Alexa, show me -whatever- on youtube\" it will bring up a variety of dailymotion links.\n\nSpeaking of video, I found that I have to use really precise wording with it. An example would when I tried to watch the movie Flash Gordon. I initially used the words \"Alexa, watch Flash Gordon\" and it then decided to play an assortment of Queen related music instead. Using the wording \"Alexa, show me Flash Gordon\" bypasses that and will actually show me Flash Gordon related videos. I encountered this issue with a few other things where I would use \"watch,\" and it would instead try to play music.\n\nAs an experiment, I just asked it to \"Show me a muffin recipe\" and it provided a bunch of videos. If I say \"Alexa, list muffin recipes\" it will show the same videos, but it will also say the titles of the first four. After that, if I select one, it will show me the recipe as well as an option to start where is breaks it down into pages. Scrolling is still needed to see all of the text, but you can ask Alexa to \"read step.\"\n\nTraffic. I have several addresses in the Alexa app, and it seems to only want to show distance between my home and work (nothing about traffic). If I want to visit a relative, it is unable to show me anything (just to be clear, these other addresses are in my Alexa App, and I'm using the names I gave the addresses). If I say \"Alexa, show me traffic to -specific address-,\" it will show me the distance. I haven't figured out if it can show me a local traffic map or not.\n\nYou can find Google Home Hubs on sale for a less than the MSRP of the Echo Show 5, and they seem to have a lot more functionality.

Not so much as a nightstand clock.","reviewDate":"July 25, 2019","reviewText":"Update 3: Ugh... this thing. It has a mind of it's own. Now, after any interaction with ANY Echo device, it moves to another screen and away from the clock. That is the primary function of this device. If I could go back and smack my thumb off of the order button for this, I WOULD. What really pisses me off is that I traded in a 1st gen Dot and crippled some of my Dot accessories to get this thing - thinking it would replace those accessories. That in itself was a painful experience because they claimed they never received my trade-in when tracking said otherwise. Had to fight a $5 charge on my credit card. Down to one star for the whole mess. Hoping \"Dot with Clock\" will finally fit the bill.\n\nUpdate 2: I have added 2 LAYERS of blackout film just to tone this thing down for use on a night stand. If my room had more ambient light in it, it would be fine, but that's not the case for me. Having to treat the screen like this negates all the other functions I wanted it for - namely seeing my cams from the bedroom after hours AND a bedside clock. I have higher hopes for the \"dot with clock\".\n\nUpdate 1 (after thought): this device could benefit great from an OLED screen. Not so much for color or clarity, but more for the ability to turn off black pixels. While not blindingly bright, the edge lit LED still has a noticeable glow in pitch dark room, even on a fully dimmed night mode.\n\nOriginal review:\nI like this little ...thing... . It’s perfect as a nightstand clock. I don’t rely on alarms much. Having to interact with Alexa for alarm settings may be a burden to some. The most unexpected alarm feature is snooze. You just tap the top of the device to snooze any alarm- like a traditional clock, but no actual snooze button. The settings take a little tweaking. Overall, I turned off every screen element except weather.\n\nMy bedroom is quite dark all the time, so I turned off adaptive dimming. Otherwise it’s very dim all day and can barely be read. And because I did that, I also set night mode to be scheduled instead of adaptive. In the dark room, it was always in night mode.\n\nI tinkered with Prime video and asked for a recipe just to see thode other functions. If you don’t mind watching videos on a 5.5” device, this might be ok for you. Don’t make it the primary function. Video calls to other echos is fine for clarity. But- there is one quirk... the camera placement. It’s so far to the right that anyone who uses it appears WAY off of center to the viewer on the other end. That feels like a massive design flaw that somehow slipped past the final QC.\n\nAt $90, it’s overpriced. I paid about $35. I bought on Prime Day, and also had a trade-in that got me 25% off and a $5 store credit. Being honest, this is a 5.5” android tablet strapped to a great sounding speaker. The function is there as long as you’re clear on what to expect. Buy it, but buy it on sale."},{"reviewerName":"O.

I was able to turn off a bunch of notifications EXCEPT the \"ask Alexa to ...\" so that was annoying and disappointing. I was able to turn off the auto-dim features which is useful if you use it in a hall-way with little light. The screen savers are very limited and I found only one that I liked ... where are all the artsy photos that could be adorning the crisp screen of this handsome device? For those of us who view amazon photos on an iphone or computer, the option to display family photos is surprisingly bad with some photos being displayed way smaller than the screen? I had the feeling that voice recognition was ok but not great. Here is why I returned it - I wanted to be able to use my Arlo cams to display what is going on outside. Unfortunately, It took at least 10 seconds for the video feed to show (count to 10 ... that's a mighty long if you'd like to see who is in front of your door ... and that is only if the Echo Show understood me on the first command). In contrast the \"motion-detected\" Arlo skill is announced almost instantaneously on the Echo but does not require a screen.

If you are reading this. Take the negative as well as the positive reviews with a grain of salt. This type of product will fill different needs for different people. What I like you may not and what you like I may not. That being said. It works as advertised. It is not as loud as my Echo Shows 1 & 2 gens. But I didn’t expect it to be. Why? The size. You cannot fit large speakers into a small device. However, it works for me. I can hear it just fine. I like that there are Clocks to choose from. This is still not an option on the 1st & 2nd gen Echo Shows. It has a physical shutter for the camera. Also something the other Echo Shows do not have. Both of those things are pluses in my book. The size is better suited for a nightstand. On my nightstand I used to have my 1st gen Echo Show, then I replaced it with a 2nd gen Echo Show, now I have replaced that one with this new Echo Show 5. As for the “Try This” tips and tricks on how to use the Echo that appears at the bottom of the screen. For some seeing that is a problem, for me I don’t stare at my screen nearly enough for it to bother me.

When you set a weekday alarm, you better be checking and verify that it says the alarm is set on the right side. That will once in awhile fool you causing you to be late for work on the day when your boss comes to town and wants to go to breakfast with you. Thanks Alexa! It's equipped with a 'snooze' feature but its even more useless than the alarm function because it only works about a quarter of the time with no real pattern to it. This is a known issue as it's been plastered all over the Amazon forums for years now with no fix in site but hey, I just got an email that Alexa can now tell me a barbecue joke, so I guess that's a substitute? Pffft.\n\nSo I picked this little guy up during Prime Day figuring if I hated it I wasn't out near as much money as normal. Already having a half dozen Alexa devices I knew what I was getting into but was intrigued by the screen. I've had my eye on the Echo Spot for awhile now but never pulled the trigger waiting on this guy. I'm glad I waited. The ability to to customize it is great and I'm sure they'll continue to evolve it as time goes on. It looks like an alarm clock on my night stand and with the ambient light auto adjustment features it isn't annoying in the middle of the night. Setting alarms and more importantly snoozing alarms without needing to knock everything off the nightstand is fantastic!

Dumbest AI on the planet!","reviewDate":"September 24, 2019","reviewText":"I bought the Show 5. Great little screen, good decent sound, customizable in certain ways, so I like it... to some extent.\n\nBut I also hate it.\n\nMy issue is really with the Echo software and AI, not so much the Echo 5.\n\nIt's useful: I use it to set morning alarms, countdown timers for when I'm cooking, to turn on and off and dim my lights, to define words, to do conversions for money and temperature, to perform calculations, to check value on a stock or Bitcoin, and that's mostly it. So it's convenient in those ways (when it works). I'd like to spend some time figuring out what more I can do with it on the daily (or weekly) that would benefit me.\n\nBut the thing I CANNOT STAND about the Echo is that it probably has some of the dumbest AI (Artificial Intelligence) on the planet.\n\nThe word that's supposed to trip it in order to listen to your commands, as we all know, is \"Alexa.\" But there are times when it will trip on words that don't sound anything like \"Alexa.\" And the room I have it in is always quiet, so it should be able to hear me no problem. Today, I was conversing with someone and said the word \"unacceptable\" and it tripped, thinking I said \"Alexa.\" I tried it two more times, and it did the same thing. It then proceeded to recite some poem about someone I have no idea about. I'm thinking what in the green Earth is wrong with this stupid thing?? And how does \"unacceptable\" sound anything like \"Alexa\"??\n\nA number of times, it's tripped on other random words. One time, it did this and then proceeded to produce a raging fart sound over its speakers. Can you believe that?? What garbage! I didn't command it to do that! I guess it was just reflecting what it often is: CRAP. I unplugged it at that point and later plugged it back in to reset it.\n\nSeriously... what knuckleheads are programming this stupid thing?\n\nI've said a number of things that sound nothing like \"Alexa\" and, stupidly, it kept tripping every time I repeated those words to test it.\n\nOther times, I say \"Alexa\" very clearly and it won't trip at all. So it trips when it should not, and fails to trip when it should -- often enough that I'm motivated to write about it. What is wrong with this thing??\n\nIt can't seem to find information that should be easy to find. For example, I was watching a documentary about Bill Gates, so I asked Alexa, \"When is Bill and Melinda Gates' wedding anniversary?\" and it proceeded to tell me when Melinda's birthday was. Say what??? What does her birthday have to do with their wedding anniversary?\n\nBloody stupid. Naturally, I had to turn to Google to get the answer.\n\nAnother time, I asked Alexa (on Fire TV) to do a search for the movie \"Tall Girl\" that just came out. It responded \"This feature isn't supported on Fire TV\" thinking I told it to \"call girl.\" I tried it two more times, each time with the same result. I do voiceover work and there are few people who can enunciate as clearly as me. Yet, this thing is still too dumb to tell the difference between the words \"tall\" and \"call.\" Seriously, Amazon??\n\nYet another time, I asked it to turn on \"Nightstand\" (one of my lights) and it failed to do so, while responding \"I can't do that with Christmas lights.\" I'm perplexed, thinking \"when the heck did I say 'Christmas lights'?? How do you get 'Nightstand' mixed up with the words 'Christmas lights'??\"\n\nJust today, I asked Alexa where downtown Stockton is located in the U.S. (It's in California.) Alexa's response? \"I don't know that.\"\n\nSMH!!!! Again, I had to turn to Google to get the answer. So I've learned that if you want any sort of information at all, go with a Google device to get the answers you need.\n\nSo, while it's been useful in certain terms, it's the dumbest AI there is. Hands down.\n\nI find myself muting the mic often so I don't have to endure as many of its flaws.\n\nLook, I realize that people like Elon Musk and his past written manifesto have warned humanity of AI's ability to potentially wreak havoc in the world by growing in intelligence to a degree that surpasses that of humans. And industry incumbents like Bill Gates and the late Stephen Hawking agreed and warned of the same. However...\n\n...this threat is absolutely NOT found with Amazon's Echo AI. To say that it's AS dumb as a box of rocks would be an insult to the box of rocks!\n\nThe Amazon Echo has a long way to go before it's truly useful and doesn't make mistakes every day of its existence. It's basically a dumb servant. Emphasis on \"DUMB.\"\n\nI would love to see Alexa's IQ increase to a number higher than the length of my shoe string. It would also be great if it had true voice recognition... as in, mine responds ONLY TO MY VOICE, and not the voice of my friends, and people on YouTube and on TV saying \"Alexa\" and making this thing trip all the time. I'm tired of having to mute audio sources or my Echo every time \"Alexa\" is uttered to keep that from happening.\n\nAnd lastly, Amazon, let's not have both \"Echo\" and \"Alexa.\" Please pick a name and stick with it. Just name it \"Alexa\" and get rid of the \"Echo\" moniker. Alexa is the name you give it by default to trip it (when that manages to work), and people mostly refer to the device that way, anyway."},{"reviewerName":"LESSISMORE","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"An alarm clock, A photo booth, A News station, and so much more ! !!","reviewDate":"July 18, 2019","reviewText":"There are already so many technical reviews on the internet, so I will skill all specs related reviews. This is my first Alexa device and I love it so much. I don't have too much preference on the audio quality, but it is pretty good and enough for your bedroom. I like how convenient it is, I can get time, weather, news and play music, podcast, make a quick call, turn off the light without stop doing my morning routine, all you need to do is say \"hi\" to Alexa. If you are a busy person in the morning, you will find it so helpful to get all you want while doing other things simultaneously. I especially like the small size and screen, it fits my desk or bedside table, it just looks like a stylish Alarm Clock, another good thing is you can display your photo on the background.

Figured we could replace a few alarm clocks, set one up in a different room or two, etc...\nWe had an Echo Dot and rarely used that, but figured maybe with an Echo Show, the fact that it displays the time and weather and such, would draw us in a bit more. Fact is, we just much rather pick up our phone and search/click/buy things ourselves.\nThese have a ton of potential but if you're not willing to sit there for hours to learn all of the neat tricks it can do, it probably isnt worth it. Unless you get these for dirt cheap like we did, then ya got yourself a fancy alarm clock.\nThe motion detection is pretty neat except when its dark in the room and youre trying to sleep. The screen can get a bit bright. I think there are options to change that, but the default setting is bright.\nWe connected all of them in the house to play music at the same time. A cool feature when cleaning the house or going from room to room doing chores. The sound these put off is pretty decent.\nThe video chat we used once and again that was only while we were sitting down to learn the ins and outs. Facetime on our iPhones is a much better quality and experience in my opinion so using the video chat probably isnt a reality for us.\nI rated it 4 stars because it is a good piece of technology, its just not for us."},{"reviewerName":"SoggyNacho","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Best New Smart Device on the Market, Rely on Reviews at your own Loss.","reviewDate":"July 23, 2019","reviewText":"Many tech magazines reviewed the Echo Show 5 ahead of the initial release and is what convinced me to pre-order two. I am still learning new things daily about this device. I'm a bit shocked that there are so many low ratings for features that can be altered, or by the misinformation in many reviews.\n\nThe \"5\" in name of the device is for the size of the screen (5\"), in case you were wondering.\n\nThese devices do not come with in-depth manuals, so a lot of the features are discovered through trial and error, and curiosity. The so-called \"ads\" (technically banners) can be completely turned off if you customize your home screen.\n\nThe clock senses darkness and light and the brightness auto-adjusts, but can also be customized. The idea is that the clock goes very dim during sleeping hours, and \"begins to rise\" with the sun. This is so cool - as it really does start dim and gradually gets brighter as the morning comes. But you can turn that off too.\n\nYou can also ask Alexa to go completely dark, if that's your preference, and she will.\n\nIt also senses when a person is within range and active. In other words, at 2:00 a.m., if you are up and being interactive with Alexa, it recognizes that, and stays up with you (the display stays brighter). When you conk out, the display begins to fade dimmer.\n\nVideo quality: If one wants to watch movies on their cell phone, they will probably love the same feature here. Most of us have televisions or laptops to stream videos. I did watch an episode of the Brady Bunch on it, and I didn't need to see the picture to enjoy the memories, but the picture quality was damn good.\n\nYou can upload your favorite photos (for Home screen or to cycle through like a digital frame), but be warned the quality on the Show 5 is much better than most cell phone pics, that it draws out the lack quality in some pictures. Have a few handy to swap out for this reason alone. I went back to the built in display offerings, which are much richer in color and detail.\n\nAs built, this wins hands down over Google's Smart clock, which is basically just a clock. Yet, Amazon combined the best of the Spot and Show, and the Echo Show 5 was born. That alone is no 3 star product.\n\nAlexa can hear me just as well as through the Echo Dot. You can set a preference of which device will be the main device, if there are others nearby. Though Alexa gets a bit confused if too close together. I finally moved my Echo Dot to another room altogether.\n\nPrime music with lyrics works great on this device. The font is large so that you can sing as you read along.\n\nIt sounds best if left on the nightstand. I tried bringing it closer to my ear in bed, listening to an audio book. Reduced quality this way. It needs that 360 space around it, like a Bose Wave.\n\nKindle / Audible books are better listening on this device. The audio sounds are adjustable (bass, treble, mid), using the app. Much better than through the Dot.\n\nMainstream and acoustical music is better than the full size Show. The loudest rock music does sound a bit better on the full size Show.\n\nAs a clock, simply placing a partial hand over the top will snooze the alarm for another 9 minutes. No button, it simply senses the proximity of the snuggler's touch and goes into a 9 minute snooze.\n\nLike a regular clock radio, there are buttons for the volume up and volume down. You can still ask Alexa to adjust the volume, or use the app. But old fashioned folks are used to manual up and down buttons and Amazon obliged.\n\nThe slider to shut off the camera gets ignored by me a lot. Maybe I'm not that paranoid, but it can be done.\n\nVoice purchasing is better with the Show than with the Echo Dot or Plus, since you get to see visually, the item(s) being purchased.\n\nVoice purchasers, using Alexa only, get further discounts than shoppers online. I saved an additional $30 on a Ring Doorbell 2. Online during Prime Days was $139.00, but by voice purchasing through Alexa, the price dropped to $99.00. Well worth it.\n\nIf you want to surf the web, built in web browsers offer Amazon's new Silk browser and Firefox. The good news is there is a microphone to listen to your search so no manual typing is needed, unless that's your preference.\n\nThe cool factor is definitely here. I wish I had purchased a few more during Prime Days. I paid about $75 with a two-fer discount at its' inception, but at $49.99, I really think there is little room to complain, if all it did was perform like a glorified clock. I kind of feel sorry for my Dots, because they know I prefer to interact with the Show 5.\n\nFor $89.99, this clock / device is well worth the price just for what it does, even if certain features were permanent (WHICH THEY ARE NOT). For $75, a real bargain. At $49.00, that's a better than Black Friday deal, and I would do it all over again but not make the mistake of buying only one more.\n\nI've advanced in tech years more than I'd imagined possible, and not ashamed to admit it. Just do yourself a favor and do not read too much into the reviews posted here by reviewers with hardly a month in of owning this device. A lot of smart people put a lot of effort into making this device exceed expectations, and they succeeded. And I still don't know all there is to do with the Show 5!!!"},{"reviewerName":"slz","rating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Not ready for prime time - It has issues - and I've had 2 of them so far ;-(","reviewDate":"August 20, 2019","reviewText":"I've had 2 of these so far - both returned and am waiting for the 3rd to arrive, hoping it will work properly.

I also have an original full-sized Echo Show and it does not have this problem - it's unique to the Show 5.\n2. The screen randomly goes all BLACK and the clock digits and temperature become RED. Stays that way until I say the wake word, touch the screen, or just randomly eventually goes back to displaying normally. This happens during the day and at night, in a bright room and dark. Amazon customer service doesn't know why this happens - that's why #2 is being returned.\n3. The screen becomes very hot to the touch. Maybe this is why the screen goes BLACK with RED digits?

I was sure to check the product comparison between this and its Google sister Nest Hub and although they tipped in favor of the Hub's larger size, I wasn't looking for a giant screen to put next to my bed. I don't have a TV in my room for reason. Sandstone is a nice off white color which blends nicely with earthy colors if you're looking to accessorize your room. The screen is about the size of a large smart phone and the setup is as foolproof as I've ever seen. I have 2 Echo Dot's that I also purchased on Prime Day for cheap and I don't know if the Show shares network info with them because I basically turned it on and it was ready to go. (That sounds wrong. Don't worry, it was all perfectly innocent.) Its functions are basic, not like having an iPad or a smart phone to play any app you wish. You have access to everything being an Amazon Prime member hands you. Sound quality is pretty good for non-audiophiles especially when I piped my Music Unlimited across all my Echo devices. If you want to rock a party, this is not the device you're looing for. The clock is smart enough to dim during the night to a dull amber with a black background and brightens its display as the time ticks closer to your selected wake-up time. The only thing I could wish for is to be able to use Netflix and for Amazon to get eco-friendly and realize I don't need every little thing wrapped in plastic."},{"reviewerName":"Eric G.

The guy who still had a clock radio on the nightstand. I had to manually set the alarm each day. And yes, I'd forget sometimes, which is a royal pain. I could have used my phone I suppose but it never felt right. So when I saw the Echo Show, I thought that I might have found the right replacement. I already had an Echo Dot in the bedroom. But the speaker sucks (sorry) so I bought one of those speaker/battery combos. It worked well for a while, but the wake word didn't work as well (probably because the dot was dropped into a speaker case) and eventually the speaker itself stopped working (it was pretty cheap). So the Show looked to solve two problems. And to date, it has done a great job. The speaker quality is much better than the Dot. I do not feel the need for an external speaker at all when listening to music. I know a lot of people have complained about the promotional messages on the screen, but you can turn them off in the options. I love being able to ask Alexa to set an alarm for every weekday. I never have to worry about forgetting to set my alarm. I like the option to wake to music or the cool feature that starts the alarm very softly and gradually increases the volume for a gentle wake up. The voice recognition also seems improved over the Dot. I don't have to talk as loudly or slowly for the Show to recognize exactly what I want it to do. I have a lot of Smart Home integrations so having a good Alexa receiver is important to me. All in all, I'm super satisfied. I don't think I'll be using the camera so having the physical shutter for privacy is great. I just leave it shut. It's a super-charged clock radio replacement.

The one I had was sound machine with outdoor temp reading, indoor temp reading, and radio built in. I had the Alexa dot also next to my bed which I found I used more for music and radio as I don't get a great signal for radio in my basement for my local station. I had looked at the higher priced Alexa enabled clock radio that was out there last year but at $150 plus dollars didn't want to spend the money.\n\nAlong comes the Echo show 5 on Prime day for $49.99 and I thought I will give it a shot and see. I read some of the early reviews about how it had ads and people didn't like it for various reasons.\n\nUpon opening the Echo Show 5 I found it to be the perfect size to not take up much space on my night stand yet was big enough to read without my glasses on. Setup was simple enough, plug it in and follow the prompts. It recognized my account and all i had to was enter the wifi account and password from the prompts on the screen. It did do a few updates after connecting to wifi that took a couple minutes and had a few tutorials it showed on the screen after.\n\nMy initial complaint was the screen was not bright enough and when I asked Alexa to brighten the screen she didn't understand. I figured out quickly though that the screen if you touch it has a way of dimming or brightening the screen easily.\n\nThe clock has many different settings for clock faces including a feature where you use your own pictures in the background.\n\nWith all Alexa devices it was as easy as saying \"Alexa set alarm for 145 am\" and when the alarm went off to say \"Alexa shut alarm off.\" It shows the outside temp and with my recent purchase of a new wifi thermostat I can ask what the temp is in the house and set the temp up or down from the Alexa.\n\nI also bought the Ring Pro doorbell which I have not had the time to set up yet but will update review when I connect it and use the show to view the camera.\n\nOverall I'm wishing now that I had purchased a couple more of these for other rooms in the house to use at the Prime Day price."},{"reviewerName":"Eric J.","rating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"A Big Disappointment","reviewDate":"July 17, 2019","reviewText":"I own the original Echo, a second gen. Echo Dot, a third gen. Echo Dot and a second gen. Echo Plus. I still use all of them, and they've all been worthwhile purchases. I just received the Echo Show 5, and it's really poorly executed in both hardware and software. Even though I bought it at the sale price on Prime Day, I'm pretty sure I'm going to return it. If I'd paid full price, it would definitely go back.\n\nThe screen has very poor viewing angles, which causes significant color shift if you're looking at it from partially off to the side. In addition, the screen seems to have poor backlight uniformity which causes a vignetting effect.\n\nAfter executing a command, it takes way too long to return to the home screen. I discovered you can tell it to \"go home\" and it will go back to the home screen immediately, but this is an additional command that shouldn't be necessary. After I turn a light on or off, I would like it to return immediately to the clock display since I intended it to replace my alarm clock.\n\nWhen I tell the Echo Show 5 to turn on a light (a Philips Hue bulb), it will show the intensity at 90 percent or less even though the light is at full brightness. Similarly, when the light is fully turned off, the intensity is shown as 10 percent or more. I've tried manually adjusting the percentage, hoping the device would learn the range of the bulbs, but that didn't work. And again, it takes way too long to return to the home screen.\n\nThe sound has a muffled quality and is subpar. This might be partially due to speaker placement. I didn't expect a miracle from an inexpensive small device, but I actually think my third gen. Echo Dot sounds better. Perhaps playing with the equalization might help somewhat.\n\nAs others have said, the constant suggestions from Amazon about what commands to try are annoying. I've played with various settings, but I can't get completely rid of them. I'm pretty familiar with Echo devices, and I don't need that taking up screen time.\n\nAfter reading reviews of the Echo Show 5, I really expected something better. This is the first Echo device I've owned that's been a disappointment. I don't know whether the full size Echo Show has some of the same issues, but this experience has made me reluctant to try the larger size."},{"reviewerName":"SteveO","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"This is my new alarm clock. Love it, but wish I had better control over the clock...","reviewDate":"July 25, 2019","reviewText":"I've been using my phone with a clock app to see what time it is at night, and also to use as an alarm clock. I wanted to have Alexa do this instead, so bought the Echo Show 5 to replace my phone. On a good note, it does the job, and more. On a bad note, I wish I had more control over the clock. Two problems: Yes, they have many clock faces to choose from, but the night mode is not the best - I have to turn up the light output to see the clock numbers (especially at dusk), but in so doing, the \"black\" background also turns up the light output, so I'm adding a lot more ambient light into the room at night, and I didn't really want that. I can turn down the light output, but at dusk, the red numbers on the screen (night mode) are barely visible. I wish the \"black\" background was really black vs. gray, and that I could increase the red numbers light output without also increasing the \"black\" background light. Either that, or just give me better control over the color of the night numbers (I'd be OK if they were just white - something with more contrast than red/gray. Hopefully, this is one of the fixes that they can do as Alexa improves - giving me more choices on the night mode contrast and light output so I can see the numbers but not add a lot of ambient light into the room. Problem #2: One other thing I'd like to see improved - the ability to set an alarm on one Echo device from another Echo devise. For example, I'd like an alarm to go off at 6 am in the bedroom, but my wife is already asleep, so I can't really go into the bedroom and speak to Alexa to set an alarm, because I would wake my wife up in the process of setting the alarm. Instead, I would like to be able to ask Alexa while in the kitchen to set an alarm in the bedroom... Wonder why they didn't already make that improvement... Otherwise, we love this - the alarm works well, and I can set routines as I need, as long as I am free to speak in the room before my wife has gone to bed..."},{"reviewerName":"Breanne","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Good Addition to Echo Family","reviewDate":"October 11, 2019","reviewText":"I have one Echo and three Echo Dots in my home, so I figured I would buy this as an addition since it had a screen.

While I do agree that the \"try this\" messages that pop up on the screen are a little lame, it doesn't really bother me. I'm not constantly staring at the device, so it's sort of whatever. I realize it can be annoying for some people and there is a way you can (sort of) turn them off, though you can only turn off the constant rotation of them. Every time you interact with the device (waking it, when it detects movement or lighting changes, etc.) a \"try this\" message will still appear.

Games are blah. What I wanted though was to be able to view my home video cameras from EZVIZ, which is supposed to work. It does. But slowly.\n\nIf you say, \"Alexa, show me the garage.\" She will go to a loading screen for EZVIZ and then probably 20 seconds later you can see the garage. So, let's say that you hear a noise and want to see what happened. You won't be able to. You would be better off going to see the noise yourself. This has to be updated. I thought this was an issue with my old devices (you can do this on Fire TV stick) but even this new version of the Echo takes a while. Plus you have to unencrypt the video to get it to show on this. Yuck.\n\nWhat else is this good for? Showing a clock for one. Seeing some of the lyrics for music you are listening to.

The red color clashes with my photos, and also takes up some of the already limited space. The only way to get rid of the red bar is to turn the microphone on.\n\nSo this is the dilemma: Keep my privacy but ruin my slideshows. Or have nice slideshows while also letting Amazon hear everything that goes on in my house.\n\nI want to point out that the red bar is completely unnecessary. When the microphone is off, there is ALSO a red light displayed on top of the device. Users do not need both of these indicators. The red light is more than adequate for communicating microphone status. There is no need to ruin slideshows."},{"reviewerName":"Bob From Springfield","rating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great device but TERRIBLE ESP","reviewDate":"July 20, 2019","reviewText":"I -LOVE- the Echo platform. Compared to its closest rival (Google Home), Alexa seems \"friendlier\" (possibly because of the wake word) and the app is a lot simpler.\n\nI ordered three of Echo 5's because they're the PERFECT size for a desk, night stand or something to sit beside the couch. I also have an older Echo Show and the newest Echo Show. I wanted all of my Echoes to have screens so no matter where I am in the house, I can (theoretically) stream a security camera to it if necessary.\n\nThe biggest problem with the platform is that the ESP is just plain awful. ESP is the feature that has the closest Echo respond to your voice. That's the theory, anyway. Reality works differently. I'll talk to the Echo in my living room and the one in the kitchen responds. I'll talk to the Echo in the kitchen and the one twenty feet down the hall will respond.\nThat's only mildly amusing if I'm just adding something to my grocery list. It's extremely frustrating if I'm trying to turn off an alarm, set a timer or view a security camera. It's not amusing when I'm asking the Echo two feet away to show me the porch camera and the Echo far away in another room streams it instead.\n\nThe cause of the issue isn't having too many Echoes. I also have multiple Google Homes and they've never had this issue. I don't have an open floor plan and there are a lot of walls separating each Echo. The Echo's ESP detection just isn't very good.\n\nIf it weren't for the Echo's complete lack of ability to recognize when I'm two feet away and respond accordingly, this would rate a solid five stars. However, since the Echo twenty feet away and in another part of the house routinely responds to my commands, I have to give it two out of five stars."},{"reviewerName":"C. Gord","rating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Poor sound quality, voice recognition issues & limited screen make it less useful","reviewDate":"August 22, 2019","reviewText":"Last year I received an Echo Spot as a gift to use on my nightstand and I really liked the addition of Alexa to my bedroom. I've been adding a variety of smart plugs all over my home and the ability to control lights by voice has really sold me on making this part of my home's infrastructure. My only complaints about the Spot were the screen is a bit too small to use for video playback (whether streaming or looking at the feed from my security camera), as well as read the time when I have my glasses off at night. The Show seemed like a great upgrade to get a bigger screen without sacrificing much more of my nightstand counter space.\nSo, I setup the Show and at first I thought it was a good fit. Got it on my home WiFi without a hitch and it integrated right in with all my Echo devices. After a few days of use issues with the Show 5 became apparent, however.\n\n1. The viewing angle of the screen Amazon designed the Show 5 with is somewhat limited. When angled directly at me I could see it pretty well, but is I moved too far left, right or up the picture drops off in quality rather quickly. I would have it turned toward my head while slept so I could see the time at night when I woke, but when I got up I would have to turn it so I could read it at all, then remember to turn it back the following evening. While standing it was somewhat of a lost cause, but it made me realize while there are so many third party adjustable stands for the unit.\n2. The mics for the voice recognition just did not seem as responsive as the Spot's. From just on the other side of my bed it had problems picking up voice commands spoken in a regular tone of voice, causing us to have to shout at it just to recognize commands, on more than a few occasions.\n3. The sound quality of the Show 5 is very bass heavy, which might be fine for music, but made it difficult to understand when I listened to speech, like the news. I adjusted the EQ in the settings and ended up turning the bass all the way down, which helped, but never made speech quite as clear as on my Spot. Right before giving up on the Show 5 the audio from music playback even started to get crackly and garbled. Not unlistenable, but obviously of poorer quality.\n\nSo, it was a failed experiment. The form factor of the Show 5 is certainly appealing. Size is good and the control work well. I appreciate the ability to close a shutter over the camera, especially. Still, it needs a revision. I've seen wireless speakers with much better sound playback quality and I know better LCD screens can be had to provide a better picture. Please, Amazon, try to make improvements to a Show 5.1 model and I will definitely give this another go!\nUntil then, both Show 5s my household bought have been returned to you."},{"reviewerName":"Sara ann light","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Amazon needs to tell the truth!!","reviewDate":"September 16, 2019","reviewText":"I bought this device specifically to video call with my grandmother.

I called Amazon \"customer service\" the first time and after being on the phone for over an hour, trying a million different things, I was told I needed to buy another Amazon echo show to be able to two-way video call. I told him that was deceitful because the commercials and the box says Skype and easy video calls. But, I believed that guy and spent another $90 buying myself a show 5.

I had her try everything I knew before I called Amazon \"customer service\" again. So, I called and after 45 minutes on the phone with some women named Claudia I'm still not able to video with my grandmother! Claudia had me factory reset my echo that I literally took out of the box and connected less than 30 minutes prior. She was not helpful at all. I told her at least 4X it was my Grandmother but she still kept referring to her as my mother. I explained the whole story at the beginning of the call about us being cross country but this woman obviously didn't care enough to remember that fact.

With these, on either my Spot or Show, it shows me the camera stream within a few seconds, no 'Buffering...' on either device.\n\nSo there appears to be something *unique* about the Echo Show and the Blink XT2 cameras. It's not a deal-breaker and Amazon's history has shown that issues like this, tend to get noticed and addressed pretty quickly.

Especially if like me you have a smart home with connected devices like blink or wyze cameras or an adt security system. The price is more affordable than the full echo show and the sound quality is really good. I am an early echo device adopter and already had several echo speaker devices but this echo show 5 displaced some of them. I bought two echo show 5's with one of them replacing a first gen echo speaker in my bedroom and the other displacing a second gen echo dot in my home office. For other areas of my home I dont spend enough time there so an echo speaker device is fine. I didn't feel the need to buy the 20$ adjustable stand\n\nIf you have blink or wyze cameras, with a little knowledge of adding alexa skills, you can just tell it, \"alexa show my patio camera\" and it will display on the echo show. Very cool. The display is adequate and about the size of a modern day smartphone. The 230$ for the full echo show seemed too expensive for me so Im glad they introduced this less expensive alternative. I'm not sure what ads other reviewers are complaining about. So far I have not seen them. Just alexa suggestions in the the lower part of the screen when the device isn't doing anything. They are not obtrusive and can be easily ignored if you chose to.

The Show has made some strides in that direction with this but not much. Heavily lacking and disappointing interface for people with a lot of devices to control. A person, Frank, on an amazon forum pointed out the accessibility option which I actually find more useful for my mom and others wanting simple touch control without drilling down three or four menus and scrolling.\n\nSo the 5...hmm.

I wear glasses and can never see a clock without them, so I love being able to ask \"what time it is\" in the middle of the night. I use it as a visual intercom and for reading audible books, weather, news, music, white noise (fan sounds) and everything I use my Echo's for but this one has a screen and a camera that you can shut down with the slide of a button."},{"reviewerName":"Richard B.","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Better than an alarm clock","reviewDate":"August 17, 2019","reviewText":"I just purchased and set up two of the new Echo Show 5 models. One for my primary residence and one for our second home. I purchased them on Prime Day and got two for the price of one. I set both of them up on the nightstand next to the bed by replacing the alarm clocks there were at those locations previously. They make a great alarm clock replacement. You can set a variety of alarms and even have the option of repeating each alarm daily, only on weekdays, or not at all. This works especially well for me since I routinely forget to turn the alarm off on weekends and get rudely awaken early on Saturday mornings. The screen on both are a nice addition to the regular Echo Dot that it replaced. Now when I play something on Amazon Music, the screen actually displays the lyrics. Also, the display shows a number of things and even gives hints on things that you can ask Echo or have it show you. The only drawback to me is the sound quality of the speakers. I purchased the latest Echo Dot and the speakers on it seem to have a slightly fuller sound. However, one of the great things about the new Echo Show 5 is that you can turn off the camera and also mute the microphone if you're concerned about having your device hacked and someone taking pics or audio of you in your bedroom. However, if you need to, you can unblock the camera and audio and use it to do video calls with family members who also have some type of Echo Show. All told, this was a nice upgrade to the four Echo Dots that I had previously purchased."},{"reviewerName":"Ronald Harris","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Same Alexa and very good sound + video in a compact size","reviewDate":"September 28, 2019","reviewText":"I purchased this Echo5 to add to one of my bedrooms, I Already own Spot, Echo, Show, Sub, Tap, & Fire Cube so very familiar with its operation. I love the size and the screen, very clear and matches the Shows clarity. Screen is large enough for viewing short videos but would not try to watch a movie. The sound is very good, better than Spot 1st edit, nice lows and mids freq. The sound matches the show but not better than Echo. easy to uselike all the Alexa devices. I noticed that some times it does not hear me and have to repeat. I went through voice training several times but just does not hear well but not a show stopper. it still functions well. I would buy again but if I wanted a better/larger video Ibstill prefer the Show. still, very good product and price especially if you want video snd audio.\nADDED SECOND REVIEW: After a month of using Echo 5 I find it is just Ok, good price for what is does. I will call it the economy model. It has some quirks, especially understanding my requests or questions. I prefer my show (2nd edition). It picks up better when further away and generalky understands my voice. If I were to buy another, the larger Show is my preference. Again, not bad but Im spoiled by the Show."},{"reviewerName":"Lauren E.

No one would rate the device I got 4 or 5 stars. I'm only giving it 2 stars because I got it on prime day with a trade up discount.\n\nSound quality is absolutely abysmal. Even around halfway up it crackles and has a static sound like the speaker is blown out. It's slightly worse than the first gen echo dot.\nVoice recognition is also bad. I've owned a first gen echo, first gen echo show, several echo dots, and an echo auto. My rating of 2 stars for voice recognition is assuming those others are 5 stars. I've never had much trouble with Alexa before (obviously or I wouldn't keep buying them) but with the show 5 I have to make my requests about 3 times on average.\nVideo is fine. It's a phone sized screen that will never be as close as my phone and I'm not trying to watch the battle of winterfell in 4k so I'm not so worried about detail. It's more of a clock than a TV and the video is plenty good for that.\n\nSo I hope others have better luck than I did, because for me this was a definite step backwards as far as sound quality and voice recognition both"},{"reviewerName":"WM-AB","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"New Echo Show 5","reviewDate":"July 13, 2019","reviewText":"We purchased the Echo Show 5 for our dad for Father’s Day.

If we look at these two units from a feature stand point they are identical. There are a few things that the Show 5 does better than the Spot in my opinion and they are:\n\n1 - Better sound\n2 - Better privacy mode (Camera lens cover) / Easy to see indicator of active / inactive\n3 - Larger screen.\n\nDo you plan on watching videos (or looking at device cameras) but also want great sound? (Go with the Show 5)\nIf you are confined on space but still want the same features the spot is great!. (not a disappointing second option at all)\n\nI Feel, It really comes down to preference, or application, more than what is better. Spot and Show (5) are both very good units. I personally find the sound better on the show 5 (mini) and the camera privacy feature seems to be more thought out and obviously screen size. Which is why i sided with the show.\n\nAnd with Amazon Prime day its is a great time to stock up on both. I have around 12 units (Yes at least 1 or more of each item that Amazon makes) and they all have a place in our home somewhere or another.

The features work as advertised. Sound is surprisingly decent from the Echo's own very small speaker. The screen is bright, sharp and nice to have. Two things about the Echo Show 5, although not deal breakers, could stand improvement. First, streaming sound to an external speaker via Bluetooth cuts the Echo Show's own speaker off. I would prefer that the Echo's own speaker would continue to work. Second, the Alexa app updated today. Despite the fact I have a new higher-speed modem and high-speed Internet, the download and install progressed at the speed of grass growing in a near-desert area. The app varies in size up to a whopping 95-plus megabytes, and I suspect my Kindle had to ingest the whopper. While I haven't done anything but finally get past the download ordeal with the newest version, my past experience with the app is that it can be painfully sluggish, depending to some extent on what you're trying to do with it.

Otherwise, I wouldn't have tried this out - SO glad I did! This little device is my new favorite bedside tech. Better than any other alarm clock/radio/whatever!\n\nFirst - with the new \"routines\" for Alexa, I can program it so that when I wake up and say \"Good Morning\" my lights come on, my tv turns on (thanks to Amazon Fire TV Cube), and the Echo Show will actually show/tell me the weather forecast for the day. I can also say \"Good Night\" from my bed and the Echo Show follows a similar routine and turns off all my lights and devices, but turns on my porch light. Those 2 life hacks are ALONE worth purchasing this!\n\nSecond - as opposed to the original Echo devices, this has a small screen (hence the \"show\" name). In the background, it displays my pics from Amazon Photos so it basically acts as a digital photo frame as well as all it's other functions.\n\nThird - I didn't rate the Motion Detection because I have the low tech cover switch always on meaning I don't allow the camera to see anything. This is just my own personal choice, knowing those cameras can be hacked and you never know who's looking in on you (yes, I'm paranoid) I just keep the camera covered - and I love that I don't have to use tape or something like that, the device comes with it's own little camera cover switch (not tech, just a simple physical cover you move back and forth with your finger.\n\nOverall, if you love your other Echo devices, you'll love this one just as much if not more.

A huge Amazon/Alexa fan. Between myself and my daughter (2 households) we own 4 dots (3gen 2s one children's). We both owned the Alexa echo 1st. Gen.  She has an echo show, and I just bought this echo show5.   I got a great deal on it on prime day (Yay Amazon)... Part of that deal was trading in my original echo(gen1)... I could kick myself for doing that. I want my original back!!! My husband and I spend most of our time in living room and figured we'd like to go with a screened echo. It's not a big room (10x15) our gen1 worked great. It sat in a corner and responded to our command's fine.  It filled the room nicely with music. (We're older so don't like it too loud) The 'new'show5 sits on our fireplace in the middle of the room.  I think it's hard of hearing! It constantly gets our command's wrong.  My shopping list can be atrocious; often times I have no idea what Alexa heard so my list is garbled and I end up guessing what it is I told her. The camera is useless unless I stand right in front of it. It points at the upper part of wall and ceiling. (Fireplace height is about 4 ft.) It can't be adjusted so I bought a stand, which is pretty useless to.  Stand only leans slightly forward and back(great veiw of ceiling)  I was hoping to be able to drop in on dogs.  No luck.\n\nI think this particular model should be advertised as a bedside unit.  It might be the only use it's good for! \n\nIn the future I will not be trying out any new \"upgraded\" or new Alexa products until reviews are in.

Seems overpriced considering how underwhelming its other features are. Alexa continues to be inferior to Google as a digital assistant. I would not recommend this device and I will probably return it.\n\nAmazon's ecosystem isn't worth the limitations you have to deal with to use it.

The following are issues I’ve had that, despite lots of giving Amazon feedback and speaking to customer service, I have been unable to resolve:\n- Echo Show frequently fails to play timed Routines, making it unreliable to use them as alarms (which I like to do)\n- Echo Show is a much worse “listener” than Echo Dot. You seem to have to say things much louder and clearer for it to register them.\n- Routines often fail to play both calendar items and podcasts, stopping short and then saying “Sorry, something went wrong.”\n- Poor integration of the screen features — I don’t really find that the screen has been additionally helpful or useful. You’d think it would help with things like recipes, but the app Alexa has for that is so bad, it’s not really useful.\n- Search function is somehow worse than Echo Dot’s, which I find odd because I would think they’d use the same system. I’ll ask my Show and my Dot the same things, and the response is always more useful from the Dot.\n- Speaker is too sharp and has audio feedback/break-like sounds often (another issue that the Dot does not have)\n\nI’ve worked with Amazon customer service repeatedly to try to fix these issues, especially the problems with Routines, and nothing works.\n\nI’d recommend sticking with the Dot, or going with Google Home Hub (which I have previously used, and it has none of these problems)."},{"reviewerName":"jimmyjames7217","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"It Sucks, watch only what Amazon wants you to watch.","reviewDate":"July 17, 2019","reviewText":"This device has soo much potential, but since Amazon restricts apps like Netflix and playstation vue it truly SUCKS. you are restricted from watching what you want and can only watch what they want you to watch.

It is nice to see how much time is left instead of asking. It is also nice to see answers to your questions.

The one fatal flaw it has is the tiny alarm shut off display. I bought the Echo 5 to be used primarily as an alarm clock. My wife wakes up an hour earlier than I do. When the alarm goes off there are two ways to shut off the alarm. You can TRY to tap the minuscule word \"dismiss\" displayed on the screen. Which when waken from a dead sleep is hard to pin point often setting the very sensitive snooze feature on. Once the snooze feature is on you have to command Alexa to turn it off. So, while I'm trying to sleep my wife is yelling \"ALEXA TURN OFF SNOOZE' which then wakes me up. The other way we found to turn off the alarm is to simply unplug it as the Echo 5 since it does not have a back up power source.\nIt would have been better if Amazon made the alarm off function easier to use. So that others aren't waken up because the snooze function is sensitive to the touch and someone has to tell Alexa to shut shut it off.

I am a very satisfied Amazon customer. I bought the Echo Show 5 during Prime Day at a deeply discounted price. It was not what I expected. I intended to replace my original generation Echo Dot. But the Echo Dot works much better, although it does not have a display. The biggest issue with the Echo Show 5 was sound distortion - random and intermittent. A quick WEB search revealed that I was not the only person to experience this. It may be a software issue and likely will be addressed with a new software build. However, even without the distortion I found the sound quality to be less than acceptable. I also found the display to be too small and as with all Echo Show devices, the ability to customize is limited. Another small annoyance is that in the middle of the night when I ask Alexa \"what time is it,\" the Echo Dot lights up giving positive feedback that it has heard me; the Echo Show 5 remains dark with no indication. I am sure that some people will find the Echo Show 5 to be a good choice and they will eventually fix the sound distortion (Google it).

The problem was that after the wake word there was a blue bar, and a tone; the blue bar stayed for about 30 seconds then an orange bar and back to home page. On the third call, they said that there was an update that my device had not installed and I should move it next to the router for a few hours which I did. Has worked fine since then.\n\nBlink xt2 camera:\nMain reason for buying Show 5 but since there is no motion detection notification, can't use speaker and no clip file this device is the least useful of all the devices on which we use the Blink app (phone, tablet, ipod).\n\nSet up:\nNo issues\n\nAudio:\nQuality and volume seem fine to me.\n\nSmart home:\nResponse time is fine for showing Hue lights.\n\nTry this suggestions:\nDon't stay on screen long and don't bother me.\n\nTimer:\nShrinks and moves to right corner which is not a problem for the way I use the timer. Saw a review that said changing volume canceled timer but that doesn't happen to me.\n\nMicrophone:\nHaven't had any issues with the microphone hearing the wake command.\n\nAdaptive Brightness:\nNeeds a better description. Saying that it automatically adjusts brightness based on available light neglects to tell whether the display gets brighter or dimmer. Display gets dimmer as the room gets darker which is the opposite of what I want. Would be nice to have both.\n\nBluetooth:\nNo problem connecting Fire tablet, but when not actively streaming, the Show would periodically disconnect and reconnect. Annoying so I disconnected Fire. Don't know if it's a problem with the Show or the Fire.\n\nCalendar:\nSynced to iCloud calendar with no problem.\n\nSize:\nIt's just the size I wanted.\n\nFeatures I'd like to have:\nNotifications and use of speaker on Blink camera. A way to change the length of time a screen stays put before going back to Home screen. An online manual so I don't have to search around or contact Amazon to figure out how to do something. Sometimes you can ask the device and it knows the answer; otherwise, it might tell you to go to the Alexa app Help which isn't useful.\n\nThe bottom line is that had I known the Blink camera limitations I probably would have waited to see if those features got added, but I'm increasing my rating to 4 stars since the network connection issue seems to be resolved and I'm happy enough with the features I've used so far."},{"reviewerName":"leeling","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Love my new Echo Show - integration with Ring Doorbell perfect","reviewDate":"August 5, 2019","reviewText":"I have the original echo and several echo dots and use them for music and control several home devices with them.

The bigger issues are with the 5 and after spending over an hour with a rep last week, they have now raised the issues to the developers. So I have been waiting over a week for some response on that.

On receiving this Echo Show and setting it up I'm reminded of being annoyed that there are only 4 wake names for these devices. Four awful (in my opinion) names. Why, why, why aren't we given the option to name our devices what we choose? When will this (if ever) be the case? It would be so much easier to use them if there wasn't confusion between the devices in the home due to the forced use of the few choices we have.

So, that was a learning lesson for me. (As an aside, my toddler realized that if you ask Alexa if she can cut the cheese, well, she can indeed cut the cheese. Google can't do that, so now my toddler's hooked on her. Not sure if this is a good thing or not. There's only so much Baby Shark I can listen to at her request.)\n\nSpeaking of toddlers, Google can't understand my toddler and thus doesn't respond to her. But, Alexa listens and responds to every word she says. So I think the Alexa may be a little more sensitive.

Judging by reviews I did not really know what to expect. I had owned an original Show which did not really suit my use.\nOpened box and removed Show 5. First impression was it is small and handy. Very well made with good weight. Body is covered in nice clothlike material and the screen bezel is a solid feeling masterial. There is a nice rubber insert on bottom to keep it from sliding. Easy set up as usual.\nScreen resolution is more than adequate due to small screen size and watching video trailers was not painful at all. Would not try full length videos but cannot be any worse than videos on a cell phone. Sound is nice but lacks base emphasis even at higher volumes. As I use it mainly for an alarm clock and news updates I do not mind sound shortcomings.\nAll in all I like it better than the original show- it is handier, easy to pick up and move, and seems a little nicer in quality.

I had used the Alexa Dot for this and it usually worked. But this this new Echo is way too buggy for this purpose, and alarm need to be first and foremost reliable. This one has woke me up 10 min late, not gone off at all, or refused to recognize my voice to shut off the alarm in the morning. It usually has one critical error once a week involving softwere bugs relating to the Alarm feature, the primary reason I bought this device to replace the Alexa Dot I was using.\n\nAside from the software bugs, the hardware is pretty good. It was nice they finally added a physical shutter to a device with a camera in the bedroom, an essential thing if you ask me. The sound is good but not the best, but great for its purpose. The screen looks good but takes a long time to load videos when compared to the Amazon Stick.\n\nThis device is okay, just don't depend on it as an Alarm."},{"reviewerName":"MrKing","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Amazon Listen's to its customers","reviewDate":"July 29, 2019","reviewText":"I really wanted an echo device for my bedroom as a clock radio but my wife was freaked out about having a camera in the bedroom.

One thing I was worried about was would it be too bright while I was sleeping. Luckily the camera dims pretty significantly so did not bother me at all. They have also removed a lot of the suggestions that pop up randomly on the other Echo Show devices.\n\nMy only two complaints are there is no battery backup so if my electricity goes out I am going to miss my alarm.

It actually linked up with my WIFI and my AMAZON ECHO DOT without my having to enter any information (a bit scary actually). I think that the only thing that I had to do was create a DEVICE GROUP which syncs my ECHO SHOW with my ECHO DOT.\n\nPROS:\n\nAlmost everything is a PRO. The ECHO SHOW is sitting on my desk immediately under my main computer monitor and it responds very well to spoken commands. The SOUND QUALITY is very good but I do not use its internal speakers because I have a very good audio system on my desk that I connect the SHOW to with the EARPHONE PLUG (please see CONS).\n\nCONS:\n\n1) As mentioned above, the SHOW is connected to a very good audio system via the EARPHONE JACK on the SHOW. It seems that this means the EQUALIZER within the SHOW is not part of this configuration because the EQUALIZER on the SHOW does not affect the sound out of the EARPHONE JACK + AUDIO SYSTEM. Not a show stopper but it would have been nice if the EQUALIZER worked with the built in speakers and the EARPHONE JACK.\n2) The SHUTTER in front of the ECHO SHOW CAMERA is WHITE PLASTIC rather than CHARCOAL PLASTIC. This is just a cosmetic thing but it means there is a little white circle showing on the front of the SHOW when the shutter is closed. When the SHUTTER is open, you cannot see anything.\n3) There seems to be some kind of activity on the HOME SCREEN every 5 minutes or so. When the SHOW is not actively playing musing or responding to a command, it would be nice if the screen did nothing except show the DATE TIME and TEMPERATURE. Some folks like me are easily distracted and a KEEP IT SIMPLE STUPID / OCD / ADHD mode that just updates things when it has to would be super.\n\nI like the SHOW very much and find it to be a good addition to the ECHO FAMILY here at my house."},{"reviewerName":"LyndaZP","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"AWESOME LITTLE FELLA!!","reviewDate":"September 21, 2019","reviewText":"I have the Large Alexa, the small Spot and now this Show 5 and I think it is my favorite because it shows the time, the temperature outside for my area and adjusts from day mode to night mode.

I’m no audiophile but I think the speakers sound comparable to my original echo and it serves what we use it for in our kitchen, light listening to music and podcast. Since there’s a screen, we have done more calling on it with family, which was previously only done over Facetime.

If you turn off rotation mode, the Echo 5 displays only the clock face. While this also turns off the \"Try Alexa...\" text tips, I find the reduced functionality a poor trade-off.)\n\nDespite the nitpick above, I give this device a pretty good rating. I picked it up along with a smart switch for around $50 during the Prime Days sale (July 2019). I think it was well worth the price.\n\nThe Echo 5 functions very similarly to my Echo dot, but with a user-friendly and decent looking touch screen. It was a breeze to set up. The sound is maybe a little better than what I expected. I did find that adjusting the equalizer in settings made it a little more pleasing to my ear (I actually turned down the bass -- I assume the default settings have the bass a little strong to give the unit some thump.) It sounds particularly good with the Ambient Sounds app. Works fine with Pandora.\n\nI have yet to try the video camera, but I do like the fact that there is a physical slide that covers the camera lens, since I use this as an alarm clock in my bedroom.

As far as all the adds that people say annoy them they just are not there. The only thing i see once and a while are Alexa tips. If i ask Alexa to show me my upcoming calendar events they are displayed on the screen. This would be great on you office desk....\n\nI purchase my Echo Show on Prime day for $50 and its worth every penny i spent. I only wish I had purchased a second one for the kitchen.

My Show 5 has excellent sound and vision. My Audible books play without problem. One review states he (or she) can't get Alexa to go back chapters or choose one of his other Audible books, mine can, anytime. My Show is paired with Ring and she is faster at getting the video cameras pictures than my very latest (and very more expensive) Smart phone. She will show my Prime photo library without any bother, and play my audio music perfectly. Please don't be put off by people who are still looking for the house light switch after living there for years. This is not the \"Machine\" from the TV \"Person of Interest\" or a $1000 face recognition device nor is it meant to be. It is excellent value for money (especially when bundled with \"Ring\") but make sure you buy it at $59 or the bundled price, as the Amazon price does fly around a bit."},{"reviewerName":"Pooja","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Worst product","reviewDate":"October 27, 2019","reviewText":"This product has sooooo many bugs.

Y.","rating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Ordered 2 - 1 Amazing & 1 Absolutely Terrible","reviewDate":"August 4, 2019","reviewText":"So this is a mixed review, because I ordered two of these devices, and they have given me completely different results.\n\nMy first Echo Show 5, I ordered right when it came out, Day 1. After updates, I hooked it up, and it's been a great little device. It's a little slow when transitioning through some videos, but otherwise, it's been doing a great job. Sometimes the AI doesn't understand what I want, but hopefully that gets better with future updates. Good sound, just wish it had an internal battery.\n\nBut my second one, wow, such a disaster. I ordered this one during Prime Day, and it has been a mess. After updates, I tried giving it commands, and it would listen for awhile, then freeze. I unplugged it and tried again, same results. I did a manual updates, same results. I even did a factory reset, same results. It would freeze when you tried to change commands quickly, it would freeze if there was too much noise. Sometimes, it would just show the \"echo\" message and nothing else. Sometimes, it would get stuck on a voice command and the blue bar would just get stuck. It was literally night and day between my first and second devices.\n\nAnd what's even worst is the dumb explanations that Amazon Echo support gave me. I told them that the device was defective out of the box and I just wanted it replaced. I really liked my first Echo 5 and obviously the 2nd one was defective. First, they ran me through the ringer again with troubleshooting. Then they said they checked all the settings and everything was correct, had me factory reset it again, and said that they would wait and call me back after 24 hours to see if it was still having issues. However, it only took a few minutes after a full factory reset to see it was still doing the same thing, so I called back. So the 2nd support agent tried to make me go through everything again, and then gave me the excuse that the system was \"updating\" and that the update could take hours. This was just a blatant lie. When I told her that the blue bar at the bottom of the screen was stuck, she lied and said that was an indication that the device was still updating. Absolutely, 100% lied. The device was stuck on the command bar because it was defective, not because it was updating. You shouldn't lie to your customers, at least, in my opinion. If you don't know something, just say you don't.\n\nSo I escalated to her supervisor, and was given the run around and told software updates as well. Again, I was told it took hours for a system to update, which I called her out on, as after the first usage of this 2nd device, I had left it alone for hours, and it never updated then. She then told me a ridiculous reason that Amazon devices have to be put on \"mute\" for several hours to receive updates. I told her that was total BS. First, I'm not stupid. If Amazon really built their devices that way, that would be insane. A customer shouldn't have to remember to put their device on mute for it to update. That makes the customer do more unnecessary work. Second, my first device has never been put on mute, along with other Echo speakers I have, and they have never given me these problems. And third, if I really did have to put it on mute for it to update, when I don't have to do so with any of my other devices, already indicates that my 2nd Echo 5 is defective and needs to be replaced.\n\nSo after getting upset and explaining to the Supervisor how dumb her explanations were, she finally agreed to replace my device. I'll have to follow-up with how my replacement device works once I get it. Again, I really like my 1st Echo Show 5, and it's going strong, even now. It's never given me much of a problem. But my 2nd one has been a disaster, and Echo Support giving me the run around, lying to me, and making up stupid excuses as to why my defective device wasn't defective, has been terrible. Amazon owns the Echo line of devices, so you would think they would be more concerned about making sure their devices worked correctly, rather than coming up with excuses as to why they don't. Just say \"Sorry that your device doesn't work, after troubleshooting, and after making you reset it completely. We'll get that replaced so you can continue to enjoy your Amazon devices\". Is that so hard?"},{"reviewerName":"sbrady","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"My New Friend~","reviewDate":"August 18, 2019","reviewText":"We are big fans of Alexa! We have Alexa in every room of the house, even my dad and children have Alexa in their house. The Echo show 5 is compact and fits nicely on a nightstand, desk or counter. Setting up the show is self-explanatory and easy. Simply plug in the show, follow the prompts and connect to the internet. Alexa is ready to use. The screen is smaller then the previous show. The sound is amazing and the display is crisp and clear. Alexa is my alarm and wakes me up every morning. I like that its small and compact not taking much room up. Setting reminders, timers, watching movies, listening to music and of course dropping in on my dad or children in easy with the show. The design of the show is nicely done. Of course you will have some quirks until you can the hang of using the show. While there is room for improvements with the show, we are still very happy with the show.

It was very simple to set up, and all we did was follow a few prompts. It was easy to customize and the on screen display helped describe what needed to be done on the Alexa app. We were able to set up the music group very quickly to be able to play the same music as our Echo, which was probably the main reason we bought it. Asking questions of the community was very helpful, and the answers we received convinced us it could be done, since it was not clear it had that capability in the product description.

The review below still stands but I need to add that it simply is the worst of any of the echo devices that I own. It simply doesn’t hear. I have to give it repeated commands especially for the “drop in” feature and this is with me standing directly in front of the device. It usually connects in three attempts. It rarely disconnects and I’ve just decided to unplug the device. It’s too late to send it back for a refund but I’ll definitely be sending it back for repairs since it seems that maybe the microphones are broken.\n\nI’m guessing this device is designed for someone that is sitting directly in front of it continuously. It is not very functional if you’re using it as a regular echo device as it does not hear well. As with all echo devices as long as you talk like a robot it will usually understand what you’re saying. So much for intelligent learning!"},{"reviewerName":"M.

The timer's do stay on the screen...for about 5 seconds and then they disappear...except for the timer which ends the soonest, and its countdown is smooshed all the way up in the corner in a tiny font that's not readable from more than 3 feet away. What the heck is the point of having a display to show the exact thing you are using it for at that moment if it just puts it in the background for no good reason? There's also no way to change any settings to change the configuration and keep the timers visually active. So now you have to touch the screen or ask the device to show the timers....which it does, for 5 seconds. Amazon has over 10,000 employees working on these devices and their features, and this is what they come up with? What a waste of potential.

When you are thinking about ordering one of these it is very important to remember exactly what it is. It is an echo, with an intractable visual interface. This is not a tablet or a smart tv / monitor. I use it for the alexa features. It is great because it can show you things like song lyrics and you can mess around with some skills that Amazon has for the echo. Why anyone would attempt to view videos on this thing is beyond me. You can use this as a communications device which I just figured out which is awesome. It allows you to have physical control over your smart devices and see which ones are active and which ones are not. There are no \"ADs\" that it displays, what ever you ask for to be displayed it does and it including something like \"Give me my flash briefing\" when it is SHOWING YOU THE FLASH briefing is not an advertisement.

Upon clicking around the app I found this: What you have to do is go in the app under settings>tv and video>fire tv>manage devices> then you will see linked devices.

I was surprised to get a call, and even more so when it was nearly instant. They told me they had a lot of feedback on the rotation, and there wasn't a solution for it yet.\n\nBut a co-worker told me how to fix it....\n\nSettings --> Home & Clock --> Home Content\nTurn off Rotate Continuously\n\nIt will rotate through one time, and then sit on the clock face until you interact with it. I'm much happier with the item now. I wish I had found the setting before ranting.\n----- original review ------\nI was excited to get an echo show 5, thinking it would be similar, but better than the echo spot I received as a gift last year. It's great in the kitchen, brings up recipes and is a nice clock, but it keeps rotating with suggestions, news stories, and things you can do with alexa. I'm sure some people like the feature, but it seems there is no way to turn it off. Which means every few minutes, the screen changes, and I notice it and look over. It's a small annoyance, but will likely outweigh it's usefulness, and it will get returned or given away.\n\nThe unit is replacing a 1st gen Echo, and the show is a smaller device, and I didn't expect the same audio quality. But the sound that comes of out this little box is less than impressive, even for it's size. I would say it's comparable to the 1st gen echo dot.\n\nI might be missing a setting, but the Show 5 doesn't display song lyrics like the spot does. It does however have a physical camera cover, so you can be assured that the video of everything going on in the room isn't being recorded and sent back to Amazon, just the audio ;)\n\nAll in all, it was underwhelming.

Now one of the two has all incoming video calls so quiet that the receiver can barely hear the other person even with the volume at 100%. Amazon \"repaired\" it but it still has the same volume issue.\n\nThe devices still work fine for weather, movies, music, etc, but not for calling so I guess I'll give them 3 stars.

But it continues to play. It’s a bit frustrating. But, I eventually win and get it to stop playing when I need it to stop playing. It’s great that it will guard my home when I leave. I just tell Alexa, I’m leaving. It’s still fairly new in my home, so I haven’t tried using all the many things (skills) it can do. I feel I’m going to enjoy having the Echo Show 5 around all my days.

Honestly, between that and the fact that it sounds like a demon with the tinny echo, I unplugged it and kept with my gen 2 dot. Voice sounds more like a real voice on that. The only reason why I got the show is because it came free with the ring doorbell pro. I recently installed the doorbell, so I plugged the show back in. But it's literally just so that I can see who's at the door without having to open my phone or turn on the tv (fire stick).

Therefore, I can’t play music on all my devices at once using the Group feature. What is the point of linking devices to Alexa if you’re forbidden to add them to a Group? Just ridiculous. I initially thought it might be due to there being an audio lag between the Echos and the Sonos. But no, I can (painstakingly) make music play on everything by individually sending the music through the Sonos app in addition to sending music through the Alexa app, and they are in sync.

The built-in shutter to cover the camera aperture is a nice addition, showing that Amazon is taking the privacy concerns of its customers seriously.

It’s nice that it has the ability to drop in to talk to other members of the household. The only drawback that I’ve found is that it isn’t the best at voice recognition if there’s much other noise around. For instance, we have an August lock on the front door, as well as a Ring doorbell. When someone comes to the front door, and you ask Alexa to unlock the front door, most of the time it thinks you’ve asked it to show you the front door, so it activates the Ring camera.

Set-up was pretty easy, although the obligatory update took about 25 minutes on my pretty robust home network.\nSound is ok. Alexa seems more responsive than on my other devices. Form factor and foot print are nice. Looks like a quality device.\nNot enough options for clocks and backgrounds (that will probably change over time).

Only main issue I have experienced right now is the sound (If you are watching a show and the men have deep voices, it is like super bass. It is very muffled/mumbly. So much that I had to turn on closed captions). The video picture is great. There are some times that alexa does not understand what I am saying but I think that is because I have a fan in my room. Room ambiance should be removed when the mic is listening to a voice - Some kind of cancellation would be nice. Other then that, it is pretty good. I just got a stand so that I can adjust it on my nightstand. I have a feeling being off of a glass surface may help the sound a little bit. Oh! And the Try saying this \"Blah blah Alexa\" stuff is a bit annoying. I havent been able to remove that ONE feature but I dont have adds or any other stuff on my screen except that. Not sure what everyone else is dealing with in terms of adds but I dont have any really (Not like on my old Fire Tablet - That thing is riddled with adds etc.). Good buy for the sale it had ($65).\n\np.s. It does have a neat feature that when you leave you can say, Alexa, I'll be right back. She then goes into sleep mode. When you walk back into the room, she continues where you left off.

The display can be shut off at night, and the camera can be disabled with a switch that physically covers the camera, both of which are ideal for the master bedroom.\n\nUnfortunately the alarm seems to be unreliable. In the two weeks I've used to the Show 5, the alarm has failed to work the majority of the time. I am not sure why, but I have noticed that the unit makes a single muffled tone (not loud enough to wake anyone), and that's it. Setting a different ringtone or even setting it to wake up with music, had no effect. I use IFTTT to link the alarm service to my ISY based smart home, and the scheduled alarm starts the programmed morning routines, but yet again no sound. I'm sure that it's this particular unit and not the device in general.\n\nOverall, the unit did very well with voice recognition and integration with the smart home. The Alexa functions are entertaining and the sound volume is amazing. The sound has a very strong base and is great for music. It is surprising to to hear Alexa's voice with that much base (sounds like her brother talking), but you get used to it.\n\nI am planning on replacing my gen 2 Dots with the show 5, in all the rooms.

As with all my dots, spots, etc, it was a piece of cake to set up, connect to the network and start being the standard voice assistant.\n\nI did have some problems on my Philips Hue lighting in that while adding this to my Alexa App on the phone and then getting prompted to do something with the Hue App, it forced some sort of update and reset on all my lights. We have two accounts and I have been able to control all smart devices from either account and this somehow split it the devices across both accounts with no real method or pattern. Amazon support told me that whatever I had been doing was never possible, even though I had been doing it. I eventually re-added 50+ smart devices onto one account (which meant that several Alexa devices were no longer able to control them as they were attached to another account). Then the whole thing reset again for no reason. Not blaming the Show as much as the backend application. Interestingly enough, the next day, all devices were now accessible across both accounts again. Must be black magic so don't let Amazon Tech Support know... I don't want them to mess it up!\n\nBut as to the device itself. It was not bought to watch videos as I have a smart TV 8 feet away, multi iOS devices and a couple of laptops, but it plays video very well and I anticipate fantastic resolution when I install external home security cameras. Downside is I do a lot of webex for collaboration meetings and there is no app or learning for that at this time.\n\nWhat is really remarkable is the sound quality. About the time I got the Show fully set up, Tool released it's new album Fear Innoculum. I have Amazon Unlimited and gave it a good test run as a stand alone speaker as well as connected via cable to a Bose speaker system. While the Bose can achieve the deeper bass notes and maybe give a slightly richer sound, the Show by itself is considerably more crisp and rich than a stock car stereo. It's really a pretty good speaker if you don't want to be an incredibly picky audiogeek.\n\nIt does have the same annoyances of the Spot with the clock not always being diplayed at 3:45 am when you wake up and want to see what time it is and instead stare at \"Ask Alexa to do xxxxxx\" for three minutes. Maybe someday we can just get a steady state screen.

This device works for what I wanted it to work for. Kind of. I purchased it so that my child could call and \"facetime\" (video chat) with her grandma whenever she wanted to without tying up my phone or ipad. It works. Its easy for her to call and for her to answer when grandma calls her (shes 4 but quickly learned the Alexa commands). But the sound is terrible on it. When using the Show for calls, the volume, even turned all the way up is so low that you can barely hear the person. But Alexa's voice and the ringer and even music at that volume are way too loud. So it's definitely not a speaker issue, and it's startling when you go from leaning in so close to the device so you can hear the other person speak and then all of a sudden Alexa's voice chimes in and about blows your ear drum. After trying to research to see if it's operator error, I found several others have been complaining about the exact same thing for awhile now. I hear there is the same issue when trying to watch videos (but I have not tried watching any videos on it).\nIssue number 2: DO NOT give it permission to add your contacts. When you do, it adds ALL of your contacts (and for me this includes work contacts, emergency numbers, people I haven't talked to in years but forgot their contact was in my phone...) and then you can not delete any of them! (I thought maybe it would give you the opportunity to choose which contacts to add and which to not, or at least the ability to delete the ones you didn't want on there.) This is not a good thing when I have a 4 year old giving it voice commands of who to call. Again, researched this to figure out how to remove them and there is no easy way. (Some horror stories included people setting them up for their offices and having all of their personal contacts stuck on multiple office devices.) Currently the only options are to back up all your contacts into a cloud and delete them out of your phone and re-sync your empty contacts to the device (this sounded way too risky for me) or contact Amazon directly and have them do it. I went with the second option. Once I finally reached an Amazon rep I was told that they couldn't do it. It wasn't until I threatened to send all 3 of my newly purchased devices back that all of a sudden she figure out a way that she could do it.\nIssue number 3: This is probably more of a wish for improvement as opposed to an issue, but it would be nice if it had at least a little battery in it so that if I needed to move the device from one location to another I could do so without it completely shutting off and taking 5 minutes to restart.\nAs far as the ads go, yea, they're slightly annoying, but to me, that complaint is minuscule compared to the volume issue. There are also a few other annoyance issues, but for the price I can overlook those.\nAll in all, it works for what I wanted it to. My daughter can call her grandma by herself anytime she wants, but it sure is hard to hear. I guess you get what you pay for and I got it when it was on sale for $65.

The speaker quality is so poor it's only slightly better than the half inch speaker inside most smartphones.

I actually like the smaller device better now. I took 1 star off because the resolution and the brightness is a little wanting. But not so bad that it would be a 2 star bump.

I use the Sleep Sounds app to help me fall asleep. It connects to the other Alexa devices in the house flawlessly. The only thing I might say negative about it (and this might be more the Alexa system as a whole) is that sometimes it just won't recognize the wake word. I'll have to repeat it 2 or 3 times before it recognizes that I have spoken.

I got it to sit on my wife's desk so she can see who is at the Ring doorbell while she is working, so it works perfect for that along with every other echo task.\nOne downside I did find is that this show does not support all the skills that the full size one does. Like Hulu and some other video skills are not available, which was disappointing. I assume this has to do with the device having less processing power for video, but not sure.

The volume is plenty for a small device. When most people look at the screen size, they compare it to an iPhone (5.5\").

I like to be able not only to see the time, but the outdoor temp, as well. The Echo displays that as well as a customizable background. Not to mention that it has a camera and can be used as a really nice video chat box between it and the Alexa app on my cell phone. Can't do that with the other one.

It's the size of an old-school bedside alarm clock but with a great display, more balanced sound (at low volumes at least) and all the functionality we needed.\n\nIt's less bulky and the display is more useful than the also-cute Echo Spot (the small ball alarm clock)."},{"reviewerName":"Courtney Foster","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Worth it for the price","reviewDate":"July 5, 2019","reviewText":"I purchased this to replace my Spot.

I was also able to link my Apple Music account which I really enjoy. I do really like the camera cover option as well!

You can scream or whisper Alexa to it and as long as the mic is switched off, you don't need to worry about the kids playing with it or it activating at random. I like the privacy that with the camera switched to off, I have no worry that it can turn on or be hacked. I have control over the microphone and camera features on this Echo Show.\n\nI ask Alexa for briefing and amazed how clear the videos that show the news and other skills I added to it.

The screen is ok, but if you lower the brightness so that it doesnt bug you at night, it doesn't auto-adjust bright enough for daytime. You can tell it to \"turn off the screen\" but you have to tell it every time, you cant schedule it.

When playing songs, it'll also show the artist, title and even lyrics! It can do anything all the other \"Alexa\" products can do - but this includes picture. You can personalize it to your liking - such as the bright screen dims at night (so dim you almost can't see it) so those complaining it's too bright at night - they just haven't figured out how to adjust the settings.

I can even ask it to show my Ring front door camera at any time. Pretty cool to be laying in bed and ask Alexa to turn off the lights or lock the door. Keeps me feeling safe!\n\nI have setup several “routines” through the Alexa App that sync with my echo show. When my alarm goes off, my Echo will tell me good morning, give me the weather and then the news. You can setup your routines specifically for what you want to do. This is just how I have one of my many routines setup.\n\nThere’s even a function to have your lights, TV and door locked as soon as your phone / device leaves your home (your location) and vice versa when you arrive home. You need smart devices to use this feature but it’s worth it! (Smart WiFi light bulbs, smart door locks, smart tv, smart thermostats).\n\nYou can change Alexa’s voice whenever you want. The sound quality is insane for an alarm clock. Listening to music on it is perfect for my bedroom. It actually has some nice bass to it.\n\nI’m mainly impressed with the thousands of “Skills” you can enable for the Echo Show through the Alexa App. Instead of installing apps on the echo, I just enable whatever skill I want my Alexa to have and it’ll work immediately on my Echo Show. For example: I enabled probably 20 skills the first day I had it (yesterday lol), like The Bible, hurricane news, a weather radar, an Earth Cam (will show Live Photo’s of million different random places on Earth), sleep sounds, relaxing morning music, rain sounds, and more. I can ask Alexa to read me Bible verses, meditation, News, weather, give me the word of the day, help me learn Spanish. The list goes on and on.\n\nJust make sure you read the reviews on the Skill you’re wanting to enable before adding it to a routine. Some of them are just novelty or useless. But the majority of them are pretty freaking cool. I’m going to be playing with the Echo all day today and keep teaching Alexa new ways to talk to me.\n\nSorry so long! I hardly ever write reviews.

If you restrict screen time in your household, then you should know that there is currently no way to stop users from accessing Amazon Video. And while it's true that you can set your Amazon video account to require a PIN, this is an imperfect solution because there's currently no way in Amazon Video to require a PIN for G rated content. So, (1) users can view all of the titles and cover art from the entire Amazon Video library; and (2) users have unlimited access to G-rated content.

I like that the price point of this is much more affordable than the echo show, which my son has. Same basic functionality, but smaller screen. For the price, we’re happy with it.

The show has poor voice recognition and the speaker is quite under-powered. Unlike the Echo it replaced, it misses about 1/4th of the requests.\nThen there is the speaker. While it has a decent freq. response, it isn't loud enough to be heard very well throughout just the kitchen.\nAll-in-all, I am quite underwhelmed.

It's about the size of a mid-range cell phone screen. It also (like the others in the echo line) is required to be plugged in. So not really portable aside from moving it around whatever surface its on. I would recommend buying a stand. I've connected my google calendar and it works great. We can walk into the kitchen and ask what is on our schedule for the day. Pretty quick display changes between apps.\n\nSome nice features - calendar integration, music integration, built in web browser with voice commands, amazon photo's for quick background changes. Video calling between device and cell phones!\n\nSome things I'd like to see fixed - the camera placement is odd for us. It tends to point upwards. Not a huge deal. I can't seem to call out with video from the device. We can initiate a video call from our alexa apps on our iphones.

We tried using a 7 in fire tablet and using the show feature but it would not integrate with the ring cameras and was useless to us. This was the best option.

I had assumed it would sound similar to the echo dot, but the speaker really packs a punch and really fills the room with quality sound. The display quality is fairly good too, pretty much what you would find on a standard smartphone or tablet. Alexa integration is the same as every echo device, except the visual feedback is really nice, especially when playing games or getting the news. The main drawback of the Echo Show 5 is the ads. During the daytime (or when the room is well lit) the device frequently displays ads for Alexa features and skills. So if, like me, you're interested in seeing the clock face always on when the device is idle, then you will find it pretty annoying. Overall a pretty awesome device.

It didn't automatically connect to my Fire TV either so I still need to go back in and reset everything, I just haven't had time. I use the timer a lot (for cooking, laundry, etc) and I was disappointed that you cannot leave the timer front and center on the screen. It eventually becomes tiny up in the top corner and you still have to ask what's left on it if you're across the room. I tried asking her to leave it large / on the main screen but she doesn't understand. I probably wouldn't have purchased this had I tried it out prior. I would have either waited to get the fancy show or just kept my Echo. I didn't feel like I needed the Fancy show b/c I don't plan to watch shows on it. However, if the sound/recognition quality is better - it's probably the way to go.\nI am giving it 3 stars because I do like what the screen shows/ suggests - weather, try this/that, etc. That's something that a device without a screen can't do.

Really Amazon if you keep breaking stuff the device is not bulletproof enough to replace a regular alarm clock.\n\nItem 1 (affects both of my Echo Show 5 devices:\nIt will no longer show the time in big numerals. Instead it shows the time at the top left with a big blank area where the time should display. As suggested on Reddit I toggled the Home Content settings that govern what you see on the screen, like sports highlights and so forth (turning them on and then off again because I just want an alarm clock. I did the same for Rotate Continuously, all to no avail.\n\nItem 2 (affects all of my Echo devices):\nMy alarms stopped playing my local radio station, instead playing the default alarm tone. When I try to play the same station (KOMO on Tunein) it is silent for a while, then says \"KOMO on Tunein isn't available right now\". However if I go to the Tunein website on my PC it can play KOMO.\n\nItem 3 (affects all of my Echo devices):\nIn order to set the aforementioned alarms I had to do it by voice, as you cannot choose music/radio as an alarm sound.\n\nIf these weren't all past their return date, they would be in a box right now. They fail at what should be their primary purpose - an alarm clock that you can easily configure via an app (try rescheduling an alarm late at night by vouce6when your spouse is sleeping.\n\nPrevious review below:\nThe device itself is really nice. I especially like the screen, the mechanical camera shutter, and the sound quality.\n\nCORRECTION - the rest of this (below) is incorrect, the Echo Show 5 *does* let you cancel the upcoming iteration from the screen while leaving subsequent iterations intact.\n\nWhat I have an issue with is the following:\nI have an alarm set for 7am weekdays.\nI get up early one morning (or tomorrow is a day off).\nIn either case I would want to cancel just the next alarm.\nI can accomplish this by speech - asking to cancel the alarm and then responding to the follow-up question (\"cancel all, or cancel next?\").

Great alarm clock!","reviewDate":"October 1, 2019","reviewText":"Feeling like I was being left behind technologically, I decided to try the Amazon Echo Show to find out if it lived up to the hype. My verdict is I think it's fun to explore and I really do like it as an nightstand alarm clock which truth be told is what finally pushed me to purchase it. It has a nice bright display for daytime and dims at night. Not only does it dim at night, it has a 'night mode' where the numerals change to a red/orange with a black background. It is visible in the evening (prior to bed) but when you turn out the lights it REALLY dims such that it has a very faint illumination. I have looked for years for an alarm clock that dimmed enough in the dark that it didn't illuminate the room and disturb my sleep. I was truly delighted to see this feature. It also has a 'sunrise' feature where it starts illuminating to a bright orange as the final minutes tick down to your alarm going off to help you wake up (this is optional). Multiple sound effects to choose from to wake you if you want an alarm but music is of course an option as well. Snooze is an option with this clock either through touching the screen or saying, \"Alexa, snooze\" to give you more time to get up. There are so many options I haven't explored but plan to. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is there is minimal instructions on how to use. I know it's made to be intuitive and with it being advertised as learning to do new things all the time, it's hard to include instructions with what seems like limitless possibilities but some of us are old school and like to read instructions. I would have preferred MORE instructions even if you can't cover everything. Even just the alarm clock features could have been documented. I had to figure out how to use with trial and error and exploring the settings drop down menus. Of course I asked Alexa for help but she didn't understand all of my questions. She seemed better exploring the outside world than the functions of the clock. \"Alexa, change the alarm from 4:30am to 5:00am\"....her response \"Setting a 2nd alarm for 5:00am\".

As a heavy sleeper this is great!\n\nThe integration and software features are amazing, but the primary reason to finally upgrade to this particular Echo option is the physical optical break for the built in camera. Other models may have included software options to disable the camera, but having a physical block simply can't be beat.

She does not understand some simple things wil she does not understand some simple things though, for example , she does not recognize that mobile phone and cell phone is the same thing . With time and updates she has a lot of potential."},{"reviewerName":"C. Patrick","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Good addition to Echo line","reviewDate":"July 23, 2019","reviewText":"I picked up a couple of Show 5s on Prime Day; one was installed in my home office for reminders and monitoring my Ring doorbell camera and the other went in my bedroom, taking the place of my old alarm clock and an Echo Dot. Integration with the Alexa app was easy and the doorbell camera comes right up so I can see if it's a Jehovah's Witness or the pizza delivery man at my door. The bedroom Show works well as a hands-free alarm clock; the automatic night mode is dark enough for me (a light sleeper) to not be disturbed by the display, but during the day is bright and readable. My only complaint is that there are \"Try 'Alexa, tell me <whatever>'\" suggestions on the home screen and turning off the Discover Alexa setting does not get rid of them. I like to have the time, weather, reminders, etc. cycle on the home screen, so turning that off so I don't have to see the \"Try Alexa\" suggestion is a no-go for me. If there was a way to not show these annoying suggestions, I would have given this 5 stars."},{"reviewerName":"Kindle Customer","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Alexa can't shut off the alarm if your internet goes out.","reviewDate":"October 5, 2019","reviewText":"I bought this to use as an alarm clock in my bedroom and am quite pleased with it. I really like the sound in it even more than my full size echo show. The other night my internet went out (not a power loss) and I was pleased the alarm still went off and woke me up. HOWEVER without an internet connection Alexa does not function so I could not get her to shot off the alarm. One would think that since Alexa is in this device and so is the alarm that she would not need an internet connection to stop the alarm but this is not the case. I ended up unplugging it and plugging it back in to stop the alarm. I believe the mute button may shut off the alarm as well and will have to try that next time this happens. Other than that this is an excellent device and definitely the easiest alarm clock to set and change I have ever owned. I like the hardware switch that covers the camera with a physical shutter rather than electronically shutting off the camera. The sound is fantastic. The auto dimming works very well. I was planning on getting an echo show for my kitchen but I may be getting another echo show 5 instead."},{"reviewerName":"Eric M","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Delightful appliance every home should have","reviewDate":"July 8, 2019","reviewText":"All the best of an Echo product + a touchscreen.

So much so, in fact, I returned it for a replacement under the assumption the first Show 5 received was defective. The sound was uneven and sometimes sounded “ mushy” with a hint of distortion even at lower volumes. Amazon was quick to offer a replacement though it took almost a week to arrive. And while I believe there is less distortion, it still sounds a bit mushy. Sounds better than my Dots but not as good as my Echo or even my Tap.

I was truly disappointment at the size of the screen, it’s literally about the size of my iPhone XS Max. I bought it mainly for the capability of viewing my security cameras, however, I find it didn’t really make my house “smarter” as it claims. It would be SMART if it automatically shows who’s at the door when security camera detects motion or when someone rings the door bell. Instead, you will have to ASK Alexia to show you the camera in order too see who’s actually at the door, and most of the time, you have missed at least 30 seconds of the camera time. But once you finally get connected to the camera, the video quality is not bad at all.

My mom and sister said they would get one so we can video call. Maybe when that happens I will see more value. But honestly, messenger video calls work just fine.

The screen is too bright for a nightstand, even when dimmed - if that's your need, go for the Echo Spot. It's really not ideal for a bedroom because of the light and the constantly changing screen content. Unless you have an external speaker, then, it's not a better option for anywhere that is mostly about music. If you want it in the kitchen, for example, you're better off with the Echo Show 2. So really, this is best in a common area or a desk, which makes me wonder just why this is the best choice for anyone but goofballs like me who have about 8 Echos in the house already.

For that it’s just mediocre. First, you can’t set alarm volumes for individual alarms. I wake up early and easily so I want my alarm really quiet. My wife needs the sound of nuclear attack to wake her up. You should be able to specify a volume level for each alarm. Also, the gradual ascending alarm volume does NOT work with music.

I just played music on it for the first time, and was pleasantly surprised by the richness and depth of the sound. Voice recognition is also very good - the only real problem I have with the Echo Show 5 is when I’m trying to use the skill attached to the game show where all responses must be in the form of a question; however, that same skill dropped a major update the same week I got the Echo Show, so I am almost convinced that the update is the problem, and not the device.\n\nIn summary, the device does what I want and expect it to do, and for the most part, does it well, or even very well.

The interface needs to be greatly improved. It takes significantly longer to start a video than it does using the app on my iPhone SE. And my iPhone SE is old technology.

The only problem I have is it doesn’t wake up easily. I have to be right on top of it before it wakes up and even then sometimes it fails to turn on or off the light at first request.

The sound quality of the Show 5 is actually not as good (in our opinion) as the Echo, and the ads are a nuisance, but after a while you learn to ignore them. That aside, the biggest issues are that the Show tends to be very sensitive to location when it comes to internet connectivity. We have it in the same location as we had the Echo and it seems to lose connectivity much more often regardless of whether we are connecting via 2.4 Ghz or 5 Ghz. This manifests itself via a significant drop in the quality of the audio while playing music. Disappointing! Also disappointing is the integration with SiriusXM via the Alexa SiriusXM skill. At first, we could request all / any of the streaming channels, but now....for whatever reason...we are often told by Alexa \"sorry, I can't find that channel\". This is despite the fact that the channel we are requesting most definitely exists and is available via the SiriusXM streaming app.\n\nSo, we will see whether we keep the Echo Show or return it and purchase another Echo.

I like that you can slide a cover over the camera to disable in SW and via HW. I will likely purchase another one for family during black Friday at discount prices as the Amazon day deal was decent.

The device itself works fine, as you would expect from an echo device. The touchscreen works fine. However the magnetic stand has no screw holes to use as mount points, and unlike every other touch screen device in existence, including Amazon's own Fire tablets, there is no way to invert the display for mounting under a cabinet while leaving the buttons exposed. You would think that even if the device lacked an accelerometer to save money, there would be some option in the software to flip the screen. Alas, no, and I'm finding myself having to return the device for a refund and go with a google product that will flip the screen.

I like that it can dim way down at night and does so automatically when set to do so, but there is still a significant amount of glow from the screens back light, and when the screen is that dim it makes reading the time in the dark a challenge. I think an OLED would give you inky black blacks and only light the numbers on the screen when you're wanting to sleep, which would be ideal for bedroom usage. Will I keep it in my bedroom as an alarm clock? Yes, I most likely will. Will I wish its screen was better every day? Yes, I will.

She struggles with most technology. We have never had any Alexa devices prior to this so I can't really compare it to anything, other that Siri on our phones. Alexa understands WAY better than voice commands on our phones. The screen is just a tad bit bigger than our iPhone Plus screens for comparison, and the screen picture is actually surprisingly pretty decent. I wasn't expecting the quality, honestly. She uses it to play music thru the day, and has alarms set to remind her to take her medication. She's getting more and more comfortable with voice commands so I have to say an A for usability.\nSo far, really my own complaint is that the screen picks up fingerprints pretty easily, and from what I saw in the box, there's not a cloth included to wipe the screen. It wasn't such a big deal for us because we have a few laying around the house, but for some that could be a pain. Second, the speaker isn't that BAD, but it sort of sounds like you're listening thru a tube or tunnel. I could definitely see why some people advised just to upgrade to the larger Show. My mom hasn't complained about sound quality, it's just something that I noticed.\nDefinitely a great product if you're just starting out with Alexa devices.

We have a ring alarm system with multiple cameras and LOVED that you could ask it to see one of the cameras. That was our favorite part besides having an actual clock to look at. The voice recognition is poor, you would basically have to be standing right in front of it to get it to complete a command. Also, the speaker is very poor. We have multiple Echos and an echo dot. I can honestly say the speaker in this is the reason we ultimately decided to return it. At times when it was talking or when a song was playing, it sounded as though the speaker was blown but then the very next song, it was crystal clear. We love the speaker power of the Echo and this was just mediocre at best. It isnt even up to par with the dot. The camera is great and we had no problem with the screen size or clarity. The \"try this\" is kind of annoying, but we have multiple fire sticks so we are kind of immune to the \"try this\" messages. I do wish that you could keep the camera as the main screen and not have a picture of a meal with a note saying, \"Try this - recipes for fried chicken.\" We are just going to move our echo back into the room we had this and wait for a sale on a larger echo show.

She now \"tells\" Alexa to call her daughter and they get to see each other everyday (we live about 200 miles apart). I would like to get one for all members of the family. A voice is nice, seeing them is priceless.

I like to know who's there before I answer, because that dictates if I even bother to answer (I work from home). As a camera it's quick, responsive and clear. As a speaker (I listen to music while I work) it's ok. The bass on some songs gets distorted and the sound made by the letter \"S\" recently began sounding like crap to the point where I have to unplug the unit and do a restart. Annoying, but it's only happened 3 times so far. The microphone is not quite awful but it's not good either. I sit 3 feet from the unit and it can't hear me using regular room voice level. When there are two other people in the office talking, I have to shout to get her to hear me. I prefer the microphone and speaker capabilities of the Echo Dot 3rd gen, but I needed the video to show me cams. I already own the spot but the rectangular screen on the show 5 is superior to the spot. I own 8 dots, 1 spot and 1 show 5. I will buy dots everywhere I need Alexa, unless I need her for a screen, and that's where I'll get a show 5."},{"reviewerName":"Gregory H.","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Good idea but with one critical flaw if you like video chatting...","reviewDate":"June 28, 2019","reviewText":"We use Echo Shows for work to do basic video conferencing, and when the Echo Show 5 was announced we decided to buy a couple, as the larger Show model is too large for some of the employee desks/homes for this use. Got it earlier today with stand. Nice enough design (basically looks like a cell phone laying on it's side). Stand pops on bottom via a magnet. There were immediate setup problems which I'll describe below, but the biggest \"flaw\" as I'll call it, is the placement of the camera and how it displays the user on the other end...\n\nWith the Echo Spot (the small round model) and larger 10 inch Show, the web cams are above the screens, in the middle of the devices. Not so here. On the Echo 5, the web cam is on one side (right). The device is so small you don't really think this will make any kind of difference, but it does. If you look at the sample image included - in the upper-right corner where I am, even though I'm sitting directly in front of the Show in the middle, I look like I'm on one side to the person on the other end. I'm not centered. If I want to be centered to them, I have to turn the Show at least 30 degrees to the left. Well, this centers ME, but then the whole device isn't \"flat\" when I'm looking at it - I'm looking at it at an odd angle. NOT ideal and as a coworker said, \"it looks very awkward\". So if your goal in buying this is for video chatting, be very aware you're going to not be centered on the other end. Not sure why they didn't place the cam in the center above the screen on this one as they did the other models (??).\n\nIn terms of using it for a clock, watching casual videos (no youtube app though), and all of the other Alexa tasks OTHER than the video chatting or anything that doesn't involve the web cam, it's fine. Of note though... during the installation, it hung up on installing updates. Once it got to a \"Loading\" screen, it just froze except for moving dots. More than 45 minutes later (on fast wifi) it was still doing it. I called Amazon tech support and they were stumped and even after rebooting it still did it. They were about to send me a new one, but on my own, I decided to reboot it again, only this time to continuously swipe my finger down to try to bring up a non-responsive menu to switch wifi channels. This allowed me to go back to a \"install updates\" screen and on the 3rd try, it worked. Just be aware of this.\n\nSo, overall? Solid build. Decent but not stellar sound. Ok screen. Works as an Alexa device, but VERY poor implementation of the web cam makes for awkward video calls. If that again is one of your main reasons for getting one of these, I'd recommend either going with the larger 10 inch Show model, or the small Spot model."},{"reviewerName":"=DeX=ButterPants","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Your nightstand needs this!","reviewDate":"July 14, 2019","reviewText":"Great display.

I like asking Alexa to play random songs on demand. Something that can can improve is the camera. It doesn’t have fish lens. The camera can not be adjusted so you have to prop the echo a certain way to get a good shot into a room. You can only see as much as you would squinting your eyes (if that make sure sense).

I think it needs to leverage the touch screen more, it would make it more useful. Here are a few reason I give it 4 stars and not 5...\n\nAlarm issue: My intention with the echo show 5 is to use it as a bedside alarm and for that it is good but not perfect. The biggest issue is that even though you can use an on-screen touch gesture to dismiss or snooze the alarm while it is ringing, there is no touch gesture to dismiss the alarm in between snooze intervals. Touch gestures are useful in this case so you can dismiss the alarm without having a conversation with Alexa and really annoying the heck out of your spouse or partner if they usually wake up later than you. For example, I have an alarm set for every weekday at 5:45am, I snooze with a touch gesture so it will stop ringing and ring again in 9 minutes at 5:54. At 5:50 I decide to get out of bed and get in the shower, but now I have use voice and have a conversation with Alexa so it won’t ring while I’m in the shower and while my wife is trying to sleep. Seems like this was an oversight that can be fixed with a software update, I hope they do. For now I turn on whisper mode so Alexa answers in a whisper if I whisper, this is a little glitchy however and sometimes I get a full voice Alexa for part of the exchange, not the whisper. Again, probably fixable with a software update.\n\nNeeds presets: I would recommend Amazon add the option for virtual preset buttons on the home screen so you can get to certain actions with one touch, like to tune into a certain station (physical buttons would have been nice for this). Voice control is quite awesome but sometimes it’s just not appropriate and touch controls make more sense.\n\nHome screen: I have yet to figure out how to remove the “Try xxxx with Alexa” prompts on the home screen rotation. It’s silly and annoying please allow for a way to turn this off in the next update\n\nSound quality: fine for talk, for music it’s better than you would expect for it’s size but don’t expect miracles!"},{"reviewerName":"Jensen S Bennett","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Cool echo device, doesn't do what I thought it would","reviewDate":"July 18, 2019","reviewText":"UPDATE: This device will now connect with the rest of my devices when playing music in a group, and displays the words.

I haven't actually used it with a firetv because I can just pick up the tv remote (I am lazy, but not THAT lazy!). I don't know if I would have purchased it without the Prime Day deal, but with two boys on completely different schedules for almost everything, it has been worth it 100% just for the reminder feature alone (something that wasn't available on my firetv's).

I've also asked her for ambient noise, Westwood One radio, and for gregorian chants; she responds well.\n\nMy only beef is with the speaker. At first it was really good--very nice, deep bass response. But over time, it has taken to hissing on the sibilant sounds; the treble speaker seems to be failing. This is disappointing; as of right now (9/25/19) I am considering a return.

The included camera is a neat feature although I have not used it yet and it can be covered if you have privacy concerns.

I have turned off every notification option there is, but you can't turn this off. Very disappointed The only thing that seems to stop it is to turn off the microphones and mute it.

The Echo Show 5 is light years ahead of that old design. My favorite feature is when I turn off the lights at night. The Echo Show waits a second or two and then dims its display down half way. It waits another second or two and then dims the display all the way down so the time is just barely visible in the dark. Ah! Blessed darkness at night. If I need an alarm, I just ask Alexa to set it. In the morning Alexa turns the light back on and it gets brighter and brighter until the alarm goes off. If I am just waking up with no alarm, I will just ask Alexa the time without looking up from my pillow and this bright voice will tell me the time, give me the weather or a news brief or whatever I want and wish me a nice day. The other night, I had been watching the Ken Burns history of country music show and wanted to hear a certain song again.

I have Amcrest cameras set up throughout the house. We use one as a baby monitor in the kids room. Normally we have a fire tablet and it stays on that screen all night. 1st issue I had was the compatibility with the camera\nand the echo show. I had to use the different Amcrest app so that it can work with the show. Which is the Amcrest cloud. I currently had the Amcrest pro app which works great with the tablet.\nIn order to use the Amcrest cloud for more than 1 camera I would have to pay $6 for each camera. Amcrest pro app is all free. 2nd issue is we like to have the screen on the camera all the time. With the echo show it goes back to the home screen maybe after 5 min or so. There is nothing in the settings to change this. So if one kids wakes up during the middle of the night we have ask the echo to show us the kids room and wait for the camera to connect . I should add it takes about 2-3 Min for the connection to go through if it goes through at all before we have to ask it again. We also have smart switches and light and those as well take forever to respond through the echo. WiFi connection throughout the house is great I get about 80-100 mbps.

However the biggest draw back is that the screen is simply to bright (even in nighttime mode) for me to sleep soundly. The screen does dim automatically when the lights go off (though this can take a minute to happen) and goes into nighttime mode, but I still found this wayyyy to bright. I manually turned down the brightness on the screen to the lowest setting which was acceptable. But then in the morning I had to increase the brightness again just to be able to see what was on my screen (even when it came out of nighttime mode). I would like it so much better if I could program it into my routine to turn the display off completely when I tell Alexa \"Time for bed\". But there seems to be no way to do this. So I have to give Alexa 2 commands... \"Time for Bed\" to turn lights etc off, and the \"Turn off the display\" to get the screen to shut off completely. Which I bought this to make my life easier not more complicated.\n\nI also found the lag time between some functions when touching the screen to be very underwhelming. Even when in settings and trying to change the clock face it would take a second or two for the screen to change after being touched. With technology these days, I dont expect this kind of lag on such a brand new device.\n\nI'm also not a fan of the touchscreen UI. Trying to control any devices in my home by using the touchscreen seems unpractical since you can only see about 3 groups/devices on the screen at one time (and I have about 30 devices connected). I was hoping to use this as a display console when I wanted to be quiet and manually control my house, but it's just not practical in the current setup. There is also pretty basic functionality if you want to use the touchscreen without talking to Alexa first. Such as the web browser, which there is no shortcut button for, and took me a while to figure out what to ask Alexa to get it to display on the screen.\n\nOverall I think this product needs a bit more polishing before its truly functional. This was not of the quality I was expecting from Amazon, I will most likely be returning it based on the nighttime mode/display alone.\n\nOn the up side tho, it did have pretty great sound quality."},{"reviewerName":"Jason E.","rating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"It doesn't understand voice commands very well","reviewDate":"August 13, 2019","reviewText":"The wording to get it to show videos is way too complicated. If I ask to \"play\" something, it defaults to music. If I ask to \"show\" something, sometimes it searches for videos, sometimes it just searches the internet. Even if the video is found, it doesn't autoplay. You need to know the exact video name and the exact service that it is on in order to get it to play a video using voice.\nIt also refuses to stop any media when asks. On all of our other echo's and dots, we can say \"Alexa stop\" and the music stops. On this device, the media keeps playing regardless of whether it is video or music. Sometimes we can get it to stop by saying \"alexa exit\", but again it's hit or miss.\nMy wife got so frustrated trying to get it to stop playing a song that she unplugged it and told me to get it out of the house. This is our first alexa enabled video device to go along with our 3 echo dots and 1st gen echo; we're very disappointed.\nThe device itself is a nice form factor for the kitchen, it responds quickly, and the sound quality is decent.

There are three areas that need improvement (two of which would be simple): The unit is fairly deep, about three inches. Unfortunately, the plug comes straight out the back, adding another 1-1/2 inches and making it impossible to set it on a small shelf. The cord needs to have a 90 degree plug to minimize this interference.\nAlso, I have it mounted about eight feet from where I sit at the kitchen table. Since the screen is small, there needs to be a way to increase the font size. It is nearly impossible to see the temperature or date, let alone text on the screen. There would be plenty of room on the screen for a slight increase of text size (operator preference) as you can do on your PC.\nSound quality is marginal at best. I have adjusted the tone to reduce the muddled sound and increased the higher frequencies but it still sounds like a cheap radio.\nOne other thing (maybe operator error?): I was listening to a newscast and wanted it to end. I said \"Alexa, stop.\" The sound stopped and the screen froze. I tried other phrases (no, not those) but could not get back to the home screen. I walked away and came back later where it had returned to its home screen. Some instruction would help.\nIn conclusion, as a first-generation product I think they did a good job, and I would recommend the unit."},{"reviewerName":"ALLEN D KINNARD","rating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"WTF AMAZON!!!!!!","reviewDate":"July 17, 2019","reviewText":"UPDATE:\nRasing to two stars, after running another power cable instead of using the existing USB cable I had, the device works for what I bought it for.

It has very colorful and various choices for how the clock looks, like digital or analog, background image or colors, etc. It also can automatically switch between daytime and nighttime view, so while you sleep its dim enough to not bother your sleep, but just bright enough to see the time during the night.\nSetting and turning off alarms are thru voice commands, so you don't have to clutter up your nightstand if you don't want to. Mine is on top of a tall dresser close enough to check the time. I often play soothing music thru Alexa just prior to nodding off, or play ocean waves while I read.\nHowever, this 'clock' has one very annoying issue that Amazon just refuses to address. That is the clock face insists on displaying 'things to try' with Alexa. There are many items that you can choose to cycle thru the display, such as news, stock quotes, weather, notifications, etc... Every one of these EXCEPT for 'things to try' can be disabled. This prevents people like me, who just want to use this device as an appliance, to do just that.

Using recipes on the screen can be a little annoying because you have to keep scrolling while you’re using it but it is convenient. The feature I probably use the most is the flash briefings and I love that some of them have video playback (like CNN).\n\nThe MOST frustrating thing about this device is the microphone. It sucks. Bad. I have to practically whisper to it so our Echo Plus doesn’t try to respond from the opposite side of the room. When you are trying to start or stop a timer, forget about it. Just click the dismiss button on the screen. Sometimes (I guess because it can’t hear you) it will only listen for a split second and not let you get the command out. It almost drives you to pull out your phone and we frequently just ask the Echo Plus because of how frustrating it is dealing with the show.\n\nIf I had to go back, I would have just spent the extra money on the nicer model and skip this release altogether."},{"reviewerName":"Alexxxx Fair","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Not ready for Prime time","reviewDate":"July 15, 2019","reviewText":"Update: The buggy-ness took a few months to iron out but the device now gets more stars and is very useful.\n__________________________________________________________________\nThe device on it's merits is decent.

Boy am I glad I did! While this isn't something I would want to watch long videos on necessarily, the Echo Show 5 definitely shines as a 21st century alarm clock. It fits in perfectly with Amazon's other Alexa devices, and make it even better by adding a nifty screen on it that is just large enough to show you everything from the time (of course), to whatever else you want it to show and cycle through. For instance, mine switches between the weather and what various sports teams are up to, but you can easily make it show you the news, the stock market, or whatever! Another nice feature is the face that the camera has a physical shutter. When it comes to bedtime, the brightness level automatically adjusts to its dimmest setting. For some folks, if it was in their face while they sleep it may still be a bit bright, but it's not bright enough to light up a room either. The sound quality isn't the best, especially if you have an Echo Plus to compare it to but it gets the job done if you just want to play a song or two. Overall, if you're in the market for a new alarm clock and like having Alexa integration, the Echo Show 5 is definitely a great choice, especially if you can get it on sale!"},{"reviewerName":"Leo","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"I highly recommend, looks beautiful and works great.","reviewDate":"August 1, 2019","reviewText":"We love it's size, small enough to be put anywhere but big enough to see exactly what is going on the screen without having to walk up to it.

We used it as a baby monitor (with an Amazon Cloud Can), an alarm clock, as well as a music player and we loved it. We just thought maybe smaller is better due to it being beside our bed on a small bedside table.\n\nThe positives are the small size, the great sound when playing music, the look of a regular alarm clock, and not as much light as the 1st Gen at night when we’re asleep.\n\nThe negatives are when using it as an alarm clock it is totally unreliable. Three times now the alarm has failed to go off at the designated time. When I go to bed at night I check to make sure the alarm is displayed at being active but somehow during the night it “looses” it and doesn’t go off. Never had that problem with 1st Gen.\n\nNext negative, you have to speak very loudly for Alexa to hear your commands. We were accustomed to just speaking in a normal voice with the 1st Gen but with the Show 5 you have to almost yell unless you’re sitting right next to it. If music is playing and you want a command heard you have to be right next to it and literally yell for it to stop, skip, or whatever.\n\n3rd negative is when using it as a monitor with a cloud cam you can’t “pinch” to zoom in like you could with the 1st Gen (my wife just told me she can’t do that with the 2nd Gen either). Not a horrible feature but was kind of convenient when our son was a baby.\n\nIt also doesn’t dim when are using it as a monitor with a cloud cam. You have to manually slide down the menu and adjust it at night. It also doesn’t go back to the camera after you make a command. After you adjust the volume, reset an alarm or cancel an alarm, you have to tell it to “show me cloud cam” again. We did not have to do that before.\n\nIt also freezes from time to time and won’t let you do anything until you unplug and plug it in again. Same thing with our new 2nd Gen Show we bought during Prime days. This could be a software issue I suppose.\n\nWe’ve had the Show 5 about a month now and we are getting very frustrated with it. Amazon support has said they would call us back twice now and still haven’t heard from them. I’m very disappointed in this product as well as Amazon for not handling it better.\n\nBut... as my wife says “what did you want for 80 bucks?”"},{"reviewerName":"Patrick W","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Speaker goes out after about 10 minutes of use","reviewDate":"October 10, 2019","reviewText":"The device is pretty sweet.

I was really looking forward to referring to the screen when asking the Echo Show a question.\n\nMore often than not, it failed to meet my expectations. Normal questions produce the response in text, with no additional images. While it was neat to have cycling facts or updates, they usually weren't important enough to draw my attention.\n\nThe worst part was when I gave the command \"Alexa, set the lights to 100% brightness\".

However, there is an ongoing bug which is encountered on practically any Echo Show 5 device at some stage: call volume becomes so low (for any type of call), that it's almost impossible to hear the other party. Resetting to factory defaults, restarting, etc. sometimes helps for a limited time, and sometimes not at all. No matter what you do, sooner or later the problem reappears. I have three Echo Show 5 devices and they all started to experience this bug at some stage. Other Echo devices (two 3rd gen Echo Dots and one 2nd gen Echo Dot) work perfectly for calls. Unfortunately, there is no way to manually control the call volume (no voice command, nothing in the on-screen menus or the Alexa app). The master volume doesn't make a big difference: even when set to the maximum, the call volume remains very low. Amazon is aware of the issue, which has been reported numerous times, but seems to be unable to fix it (no fix for a long time). Since making calls (of all types: intercom, Skype, Alexa) should have been a mainstream use case for the Show devices (as it is for all other Echo products), I cannot recommend buying the Echo Show 5 until this issue is fixed (it would be highly recommended otherwise). I will gladly update this review to reflect any fix, if and when such a fix becomes available."},{"reviewerName":"Neil B.","rating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Save your money","reviewDate":"July 25, 2019","reviewText":"I bought this to replace my bedroom dot.

Met all of my expectations.\n\nI configured the Echo Show 5 for my 94-year-old mother-in-law, operating as a smart-frame, cycling through a series of photos of her with her grand-children and family members. I used a Facebook album I custom-configured for her - I cropped each of the photos to landscape mode to fit the configuration of the Echo Show 5 screen, and highlighted faces, rather than full-body photos, to accommodate the compact size of the Show 5 screen. When cropping, I left extra room in the upper-left corner of each photo so when the Echo Show 5 superimposes the time and outside temperature on the image, it didn't obscure anyone's face. I used Smart-plugs to voice-activate lamps and nightlites around her one-bedroom apartment - she gets a kick out of using her voice to turn on or off the lights and TV in her apartment.\n\nOther reviews had complained vociferously about the Echo Show 5's propensity to continuously display suggestions and 'Try this' hints, which would be annoyingly distracting for a 94-year-old non-techie. I was successfully able to turn these off (through following other reviews) by going to Settings (on the device screen itself), selecting 'Home Screen Settings', and setting 'Cycle Continuously' to [Off], and turning ALL other selections on that settings page to [Off]. On the 'Clock' settings page, I configured 'Background' to the Facebook Album I'd created for this purpose. I configured the Cycling Frequency to 'Fast' (ignore the description on this page of '2 seconds per image', as I found, even at this setting, and with the other settings configured above, that the Echo Show 5 lingered for a full 50 seconds on each image before cycling to the next photo in the album). Viola! A perfectly-acceptable photo-frame for an elderly person with the added benefit of clock, weather, and voice-activating her apartment. For an individual 'of a certain generation' who completely by-passed and ignored the keyboard-Internet-smartphone eras, she loves her Echo Show 5 and is completely comfortable telling Alexa to 'turn on the TV'."},{"reviewerName":"Madison Oriente","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Not perfect.. but good.","reviewDate":"September 20, 2019","reviewText":"Amazon, thanks for a useful and fun product. I have three top critics, and for the most part I like everything outside of these things about my new Echo 5.\n\nFirst, I'm having a hard time understanding why the closable shutter for camera privacy on my charcoal device is not black to match the screen border. The white circle is kind of an eye-sore. Even charcoal would be better if the idea is to easily recognize that the camera is covered... but Alexa gives you that info anyway, so disguising the circle would be nice.\n\nSecond, I agree with other reviews. Smaller is not always better. I am deep into season 4 of Suits on Amazon Prime right now, and switching from viewing on my laptop to viewing on my echo isn't even tempting, even with the handy voice command feature, because the screen is just too little. While this device is nice for traveling, I think I'd prefer a bigger screen, and I wan't willing to pay three times as much for a 2nd gen.\n\nThird, and finally, at the risk of being extremely redundant, please give us the option to turn off completely the \"Try Alexa...\" loops. The ads/suggestions take up too much of an already small screen, and they are not wanted. Right now this device is new to me, and so is Alexa, so for a beginner like me they can be helpful while I learn everything this device can do. However, after six months, or even a year, when I completely know my way around this thing, why would I need to have a loop of \"Try this\" ads looping through? It makes no sense. I have disabled everything that I know how to and I'm hoping these little loops don't start up again.\n\nEverything else is cool and as expected. I want some more clock faces, but the few on here are nice. I used the alarm this morning and it worked well. I'd love to be able to give Alexa more than one command at a time. That would be great in future updates. One thing I really wish is that the display would \"Sleep\" automatically when I snooze or set my alarm so I don't constantly have to say \"Alexa, turn off display\" at 4AM. Anyways, thanks for reading. So far so good.\n\nHoping for more advanced amenities / command abilities soon."},{"reviewerName":"Elizabeth Dumbrique","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Good for it’s price!","reviewDate":"July 10, 2019","reviewText":"I’m happy with this purchase.

One morning I woke up 9 minutes late to find that the Echo Show 5 had somehow deleted the daily alarm that I set (it worked the two days before but when I checked the alarms that alarm was gone from the list). Not good for an alarm clock. Also, there is no battery backup for the alarm clock; if the power goes out, you are out of luck. Don't count on the Echo Show to be ready to go for alarms when power is restored either. As fare as using the Echo Show 5 as a voice assistant, it appears to require more bandwidth that the Echo Dot 2 or 3; I get buffering in playback of news casts on the Echo Show 5 that I don't experience on either version of the Dot. The Clock Display is difficult to setup; and wants to scroll to give Amazon Echo phrase suggestions. Even when I select do show and do not scroll, that doesn't seem to stop the action.

Upon ending a call, Alexa is \"screaming\" at the highest volume for other things if I forget to lower to a middle range. I am certain it is this model 5 issue, as all video calls with my dad from the other 2 older, larger models have no audio problems. I've tried unplugging/re-booting, but still doesn't work.\n\nI would not buy, as it appears to be a product defect, perhaps only in some manufacturing runs, but certainly in mine. Amazon will probably come out with a new small model this year, and we early adopters are short changed again."},{"reviewerName":"Calvin","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Not worth the money","reviewDate":"July 19, 2019","reviewText":"The screen has an odd effect when touching it or using it, kind of like \"ripples\" or some of the older school first generation touch screen products had. The sound is actually not terrible but I feel like Amazon tried to add too much bass. There are really annoying suggestions like \"Try this\" that constantly pop up that you can't get rid of.

I was supposed to have gotten two of them on this day but I only got one. I was leaving to go out of town, so I took the one I got which was for my grandson that was coming for a visit for a week. I wanted to make sure he at least got his. I really was looking forward to having them so that my grandson and I could talk and see each other face to face. I am disabled and do not get to see him more then twice a yr. because he lives out of state. Since the time I ordered the first one the price has gone up and at my house I have to stands for the Echo and two warranties I purchased on the same day. Now my issue is that I cannot afford to purchase one for myself until I see them on sale again. Not sure when that will be. Once I go home I'll be sending back one of the stands and mailing him his because that was another issue I had. The stands were suppose to come before I left to go out of town, which they arrived a day later. This is the first time that I have been unhappy with Amazon! I do almost all my shopping on Amazon because it's much easier for me then asking someone to drive me out to the stores.

Integration with some apps and IoT products can be hit or miss - mostly miss. Adjusting LED lights around the house often takes more than one attempt and requests are often misunderstood. You'd think, \"Alexa, turn off all lights\" would be easy enough, but Alexa often responds with, \"Sorry, I don't have a device 'all Hue lights'\n\nSome apps, like Radio.com can't set an alarm to start up in the morning, even though other similar apps can do that.\n\nAfter literally SEVERAL days I was able to get my Samsung TV that was advertised as Alexa ready to finally work. The final degree of integration for all that research and effort was that now I can issue a voice command to turn the TV off.\n\nAND THAT\"S ALL IT CAN DO!!!\n\nI have a Dot in the Kitchen and a show in my bedroom and living room. These are nice products, but somehow it still feels like every time I ask Alexa to do something - it's an experiment rather than a command that I have confidence in being executed correctly. Responses can be somewhat slow and thr results confusing, unexpected, or just plain fail.\n\nIt's fun when it works.

One of my favorite things about the Echo and Dot is that you were able to utilize the Amazon phone app to configure alarms, control lights, and manage settings... this is not the case with the Show. You are not able to create or modify alarms from your phone, this includes turning off existing alarms if you are not within a range that the device can pick up your voice. This leads me into another problem with the Show, the voice recognition is complete garbage. I have been yelling every morning to turn off my alarms, and the damn thing is not a foot from my bed. Even more so the speakers are a low quality that I have not seen with an amazon device before.

Have to basically yell Alexa to get a response. Even with volume turned all the way up. The Alexa in a neighboring room picks up my request before this device. The normal skills don’t work and just freeze on the screen (like the daily news or simple request to turn off all the lights) and then unable to get it working again. So I have to go to another Alexa (3 and 2 generation) recite the same commands and they work perfectly. Sound is less than the Spot. Overall extremely dissatisfied. Would like the timers to just show on the screen but instead it always go to promote Ask Alexa mode which is so inconvenient, especially when cooking.

Secondly, the sound on mine is not so great for both Podcasts and Music. I actually sent my first one back b/c every so often the sound/voices would become very scratchy even on lower volume settings - almost like a blown out speaker.

My total cost was $15. This is one neat little geegaw to have on my desk. Setup was a snap. The \"try this\" chyron was somewhat annoying, but it's easy enough to suspend rotation of the \"try this\" suggestions after the first run through any given screen. Very cool little device.

I bought this to replace my original echo show which was just a little too big for the bedroom. While the sound quality is not nearly as good, and I knew it wouldn’t be, it is still a solid little unit and does exactly what I need it to do which is play music, get scores and news headlines and to serve as a clock and an alarm.

Overall, it's impressive. Small, sharp looking, great screen for the size and the audio quality is quite surprising. If you plan to use it to listen to music and have a decent Bluetooth speaker you can certainly connect it. Just know that this isn't going to provide room-filling sound on its own.\n\nHere's my issue.\n\nI replaced the Echo Dot in my master bedroom with this Echo Show 5. The dot was responsive and I ran it through an external Bose speaker. I could speak to the dot in a normal voice from anywhere in the room and it would respond. The Echo Show 5 does NOT. I find myself shouting at it...and getting angry about it.

The \"try\" suggestions are NONSTOP. I uploaded a personal photo to be the screen saver and the \"try\" suggestions cover parts of the screen at all times.

Sometimes an alarm starts by playing my music, but after a few seconds goes into standard alarm mode. More recently, the alarms disappeared from the Echo show and I can't reconfigure them via the app. Amazon's software, at least for this alarm use case, is not ready for prime time."},{"reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Very poor user interface","reviewDate":"September 28, 2019","reviewText":"Very difficult to configure, badly designed screens.

Was prepared for a lower sound but the amazingly small device packs a punch.\nIt works as a photo frame (connect to FB or Amazon photos), integrates Alexa well, speaker is sufficiently loud and best part was a \"device group\" supported so that multiple Amazon Echo or Echo Show can play same music using single command.

I chose the 5 because it doesn't take too much counter-top space on my bar and is easily moved around to serve as both a daily smart display and kitchen companion. Screen response is quick, sound fills my living room and kitchen, and Alexa integration is seamless. Minor notes: after streaming Spotify for a while, some tracks start off odd and sound distorted. I suspect this is more on Spotify's end, but not something to whine about for a return. Also, video flash brriefings (i.e. CNN) start with a stutter, but I imagine that's due to video buffering or something to do with the skill itself. It's nice to be able to make tea after a long day at work and settle down to listen to yet another episode of \"Welcome to Night Vale\" or to see information I request for a recipe or search query."},{"reviewerName":"Terry","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Cheaper echo - Updated","reviewDate":"September 17, 2019","reviewText":"The camera has not worked on this device that I know of since I got it.

It worked fine. We just had to ask Alexa to show us the girls room and the image appeared on the screen. I love the idea of this. However, the picture quality was pretty blurry compared to the picture quality of the same camera when looking from my iphone. There was also about a 4-second delay on the Echo image that didn't exist from the phone app either.\n\nThe whole point was that I wanted access to a clear, live image of what was going on in my girls room. This didn't provide that very well. Ultimately I decided to return the Echo and just have a cheap audio monitor in the room. Then I can open the camera on my phone when I also want to see what's going on (since I'm obviously not going to leave the app open on my phone all the time).\n\nI think the 2nd generation Echo Show is HD and may work better for this, at least as far as picture quality. I'm not sure why the live delay existed and if that would be better."},{"reviewerName":"Doug the Brit","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Ideal shape and size","reviewDate":"August 1, 2019","reviewText":"I traded in an Echo Dot for this unit and (for me) it fits the bill perfectly.

Honestly, my favorite feature. Especially at night, I no longer have to be blinded by my phone screen at night, even when the brightness of the phone is all the way down.

One of the things I enjoyed every morning with the Echo Dot2 every morning as I got ready for work was playing the Jeopardy App. The Jeopardy App does not work with the Echo Show 5, to say it's glitchy would be a huge understatement.

It typically recognizes the words (though even that seems increasingly less reliable) but it does not know what to do with them. For example “Alexa turn on bright in the living room” used to turn on all the lights in the living room on to bright. Now it says “A few things share the name living room. Which one did you want?” And is unable to turn the lights on. By the way there is only one living room here.

Yes because shows reminders and calendar items and easy to shop and pick item you want from screen. So I will keep the two I bought because I got them during Prime Day - at full price not to sure would be as satisfied bc of the Hulu issue. TuneIn works fine.

Love the home screen that has time, date and temperature to get my day started. I keep it in the kitchen so I can listen to news with the Stream Player. I used to have a small TV in my kitchen to keep me updated when I was cooking. Since I do not have that anymore, the Echo Show 5 has filled that void. Although it does not show the local news, I am able to watch national news from a variety of stations. I've also viewed a Prime movie on the 5 inch screen that wasn't bad. Having it play in the background is all I really need so the small screen doesn't matter. Also like playing music with the lyrics appearing on the screen. Haven't played any game on it so cannot comment on that. Trending topics appear sporadically and suggested skills which allows the user to learn different activities.

I use this as a calendar / surveillance video player in my home office. As far as the ads are concerned I believe the ‘ads’ are more like screen savers and typically appear while the device is not in use or when the screen isn’t being used e.g. music is playing.

The mechanical camera cover is a nice addition to prevent family and friends from dropping in and spying on my patented smooth moves in the bedroom.

And I know that I can set commands for her to recognize, but I feel like I shouldn’t be doing that for a smart device and especially for a lot of commands.

Also a lot off the alexa app features are available here and the sound is pretty decent for an speaker of that size. Definitely is a really cool gadget.\n\nMy only complaint is about the mic sensitivity, because if you are used to the echo, you will notice the difference.

It does have blue tooth but with but with Amazon music and other music stations you don't really need it but nice to have anyway.

It often requests payment for movies that are free on Prime and my Watchlists do not match. Asking for a TV episode in a series never works.

It shows the (example: kitchen light) light at 50% with a on/off bottom and a slide dimmer. If I say “kitchen off” the light goes off but the display screen stays on that dimmer/on/off screen for 60 seconds at full brightness before the Alexa screen dims itself with the ambient lighting function.

If you can deal with the smaller screen, a subpar sound that is really only good for bedroom use (doesn't get very loud), and the fact that it isn't wireless, then you'll end up loving it.

This device is supposed to have a built in hub but why must I have to buy another hub for smart bulbs. That makes no sense.\nAlso, there are only a few things for hearing impaired people. This needs to increase so it can be completely interactive with hearing impaired individuals. Hopefully, someone can incorporate a program which can help Alexa recognize ASL.\nThe sound, size and picture quality are perfect for me.\nI hope Amazon works on improving some of these known issues in order to keep their followers."},{"reviewerName":"L.

However it has trouble with more than half of the voice commands.

It’s just not intuitive."},{"reviewerName":"Michael Walsh","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Better solution for the bedroom","reviewDate":"November 5, 2019","reviewText":"If you want a device that wakes you up in the morning, shows the weather as well as tells you the weather, plays music and has pretty good sound.

However, if you want access to thousands of songs through Amazon Music, you'll have to subscribe to the service which is only $3.99 a month. Trust me, it's worth it!

So, you can customize it to show your photos, give you the info you need, but is all accompanied by a \"Try\" ad.
