I used the speaker with a cell phone, laptop, Desktop, and a Cell phone Tablet. Operating Systems, Win XP, Win 7, Linux Mint 18.3, The speaker worked well with everything. Sound Quality is very good, Battery time is good, Durability is very good, but I do take Care of my equipment. PS. The speaker will turn off after about 10 to 15 minutes of non use, Not a bad thing, It won't drain out of power by being on all the time even when not in use.\nThank you, Hope this info is of help."},{"reviewerName":"Heather Turner","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great little speaker","reviewDate":"December 18, 2017","reviewText":"Great little speaker.

But my findings are that this is the most fantastic Bluetooth speaker I have ever purchased and I have purchased a lot. First of all it looks amazing! Secondly it feels like money. And the controls are incredibly easy and intuitive. I might even add slick. I have no idea why they are selling at this price. Because the moment I'm done this I'm buying four more before the price goes up. The sound is gorgeous! But if you're looking for sonus Sound by sonus.

For it to be so small, the sound quality is great. Although, to my ears, the quality is even clearer when I turn the speaker upside down. Very easy to use, as I just pulled it out of the box, charged it, & paired it to my phone just like that. I have to agree with another reviewer that the speaking it does when you power on & off, pairing, or when a call comes through is a little loud & obnoxious. Love the colors & the design is very chic for its inexpensive price tag. A gadget I'm actually happy I spent my money on!"},{"reviewerName":"NJA","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great for the price","reviewDate":"January 31, 2018","reviewText":"Exactly as described, and with the silver finish it looks like a high-end speaker.

So far I have only had it for a couple of months, but sounds awsome. I use it mostily for my audible books at night as well as my workouts and its better than my $50 speaker that I broke. When hooked to the phone the beeps from charging changing, volume and mods are very light compared to the volume you have it set at. I really like this little sound monster and will be more than likely buying another.\nDay 3.\nthis lthing is awaome and continues to work well beyound what I expected. Shipping was exellent, packaging was perfect and came in perfect working order.

The speaker is on the bottom of the device and sounded a bit hollow at first; however, once I adjusted the equalizer on Spotify the sound improved immensely and is of a very good quality. The only drawback is that the directions are unreadable and written by somebody who doesn't know English well, so if you're not tech savvy and can't figure things out for yourself you may have trouble."},{"reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great little speaker","reviewDate":"January 9, 2019","reviewText":"I purchased the Xleader Portable Speaker to replace a couple of old Bluetooth speakers that had stopped working. I figured for the price I couldn't go wrong. It was very easy to set up and when I played music I was amazed at the sound quality for such a small speaker. The controls are clearly visible on top and easy to use. I was a bit concerned the with the speaker on the bottom that the sound might be muffled, but the was not the case. The sound comes out clear. I used the speaker to make a phone call on my cell phone and the conversation was clear at both ends. I was so satisfied with the speaker that I ordered two more so I could listen to music throughout the house. It is small, approximately the same size as my Echo Dot, and can be placed just about anywhere. I purchased the 3rd speaker specifically to hook up to the Echo Dot with the Bluetooth feature. I also have the option of connecting it with the supplied cable. I am very satisfied with the Xleader speakers, especially for the price, and would recommend it to others."},{"reviewerName":"MonicaNicoletta","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great chic little speaker","reviewDate":"March 19, 2019","reviewText":"Ordered this speaker for my new office and it's great!

This is exactly what I was looking for. It's not bulky and it's a really good price and works for exactly what I needed it for. Also the battery lasts reeeeeally long, which is something I was worried about, and it's nice because there is a battery life indicator on your phone when the Bluetooth is connected.

The stereo in my car broke so I am using it in my car. It works perfectly for that. The speaker part is at the bottom, but in my console it bounces the sound back up so it seems louder. So if you are looking for something to do that, I highly recommend.\n\nThe other thing about this is that it's too hot to keep it in my car so it lives mostly in my purse. It gets transferred in and out a lot since I use it every time I use my car. I'm pretty impressed that it hasn't broken just with all the moving around and being thrown in my bag with other stuff. Since my other speaker broke so quickly, I intentionally waited to write a review. I've had this for a couple months now and I'm satisfied that it's doing the job and it's worth the price."},{"reviewerName":"jane pagan","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great battery life!!!","reviewDate":"December 17, 2018","reviewText":"As for now I am really shocked by this small and cute beast.

I do agree that the speaker would be better on the top of the device because when I have it on a flat hard surface, the table, it's sounds kind of muffled, not a better sound, so I turn it upside down and it sounds better which is why I knocked off a star, still a great speaker."},{"reviewerName":"PRABAHARAN","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Best speaker","reviewDate":"August 8, 2019","reviewText":" Awesome speaker .

I've listened to music as well as podcasts and audiobooks. All have sounded great. Easy to set up and has great sound. The instructions aren't great, but I figured it out. I bought the matching cases as well and my speaker fits perfectly and is protected. Get the case if you are looking to travel with your speaker. Gift recipients have been happy with them too.

For the record, the speaker itself is on the bottom which struck me as odd but seems to work quite well. The touch sensitive buttons are fine? I don't really use them, since I mostly use the speaker to play music at night, or otherwise situated far away where it's easier to just control everything via tablet.\n\nFor the record it says something about being small enough to carry in your pocket--and yes, maybe, more or less. It's a bit bigger than a hockey puck, or thereabouts, but beware that it's quite heavy and would absolutely pull your pants down. Fine to put in a purse though. My main problems see two things.\n\nFirst the durability: literally the first day we had it, it fell while plugged in (not a substantial height) and now the plug doesn't hold a cord very well; a slight jog of the cord and I have to plug it back in.\n\nSecond though, is a design flaw, in my opinion. The speaker talks to you some, with about four preloaded words. \"Disconnected\" and \"paired\" are the two I hear most because the speaker randomly disconnects. It talks slightly too loud though, suddenly, and very poorly, just absolutely awful sound quality so that I can barely understand her--which is odd since the speaker genuinely has really good sound quality.\n\nI also don't understand who you have to hold down the button to power it on. The button isn't touch sensitive, it's very small and very unlikely to be hit by accident, I just don't get this design choice.\n\nOverall--I do not recommend this product to anyone."},{"reviewerName":"J","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Amazing Sound with Stylish Look","reviewDate":"May 21, 2018","reviewText":"The Speaker is amazing in looks.

It delivered on time and as anticipated. I love how this device is setup with where the speaker is located. It honestly produces louder, crisper sound since it has to bounce off of the surface it sits on. That being said, I've had to turn it down a little compared to other Bluetooth devices I've had in the past. I love that! That's definitely saying something for me because I mostly use mind in our house while I'm cleaning, paying bills and generally active around the house so I want to be able to hear it wherever I am and I can with this particular device. I love the sleek compact/portable style and rose gold color! I'm also use to charging my bluetooth speakers more frequently but definitely not with this one, it has lasted me all day. Come to think of it, I haven't even had to charge it since my husband & I bought it. Again, it's few & far between that I normally say these kinda things, (at least in this field) because I am a major music buff so I'm unusually picky. And it didn't even cost that much considering all of the above! But I can honestly say, I am completely satisfied and content.

With this speaker, I can enjoy listening to background music at work again, and actually have it be background music. It was easy to pair, easy to use, and pretty to look at (I got the rose gold one).

GREAT PRODUCT!"},{"reviewerName":"Morganne","rating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"I really wanted to love this :/","reviewDate":"August 11, 2019","reviewText":"Disclaimer....I did not receive this speaker at discount or for free for an honest review, I paid for it myself.\n\nLet’s start with the things I really liked, the rose gold color is great the color is shiny and isn’t matte, gives it some prestige. The LED buttons light up as blue so they are easy to see in the dark, they are a touch screen type instead of a typical push button. The buttons are located on the top of the speaker instead of the side.\nThe actual speaker is in the bottom and has some “bumpers” lifting the speaker slightly from any surface which is really appreciated. I do like the size of this speaker, I was looking for a small speaker to fit in my back pack or my laptop bag with out adding a lot of bulk or weight and it definitely does that job well!\nIt powers with a regular micro cord, I’ve used the cord it came with to charge and have tested it with a regular android cord and it will still charge, that’s a huge plus that you can charge it with a regular android cord!\nI’ve only tested this with one android cord that I use to charge my tablet so I can’t for sure say that any android cord will work but I figured if one works then all other android cords should work as well but don’t quote me on that.\nIt also comes with a nice little draw string bag, however, it’s just a synthetic bag to protect from scratches, this bag will not protect it from accidental drops or water things like that, for more protection I would buy a hard case.\nHere is what I DO NOT like about this speaker, I bought this speaker with the intention to use it in my car ( since stereo took a dive) I figured this would be a lot more cost effective than buying a new deck and speaker......I needed something that I was loud enough to actually hear while driving. This little rosy guy does pretty well, but stellar but if all of your windows are up and the a/c or heater is on low you can hear it just fine.\nIt pairs easily but likes to un-pair whenever it wants :/\nThe battery life is pretty impressive, I ran it a sold 6 hours but I think it advertised 12 hours. I did fully charge it overnight when I first got it home.\nThe play/pause button does not play/pause, if pushed it will un-pair? So if you need to pause you will need to pause whatever device your connected to.\nSince the speaker is on the bottom of the unit, that changes the sound, it sounds muffled and not as loud, so turning it face side down your sound is much better but also runs the risk of accidentally triggering one of the touch buttons and scratching the led touch buttons which in my opinion has been the biggest annoyance considering I use it most while driving.\nAs far as sound quality, is it loud enough? For the car not really, for use at home possibly depends what you consider loud. For the last few days I’ve been using it with my tablet to watch movies and it does do the job but nothing like my previous speakers, as long as you have it face down then the sound it’s pretty clear and loudish even turned all the way up. My biggest gripe about the sound is, there is no bass! Its got lots of treble which depends on what your listening to can be high pitched. Don’t get me wrong the sound isn’t terrible at all, it does come through pretty crisp and clean and the volume does get loud if your in a small space but only if you have the speaker face down.\n\nI would say this little speaker is great if your looking for something for the office and needed a little bit extra volume and the sleek look and size is perfect. I wouldn’t personally recommend this for kids only because the touch buttons are incredibly sensitive and with one push of the play/pause button it’s in-paired, ( my young nephew proved that point and he thought he broke it lol).\nIt came in a very nice sturdy box and was boxed in like an IPhone, has like a deep “nest” protecting it from all angles and was pretty snug so even if it was tipped over it was still safe which is another thing I was grateful.\n\nOverall this is a very very basic nice looking Bluetooth speaker, if your looking for something small and compact and good looking and “ok” sound quality, meaning your not looking to really bump your music or watch movies just something to amplify background noise then this is for you!\nThis would be perfect for a teenager, it’s cost effective, looks expensive but you don’t want to hear your teens music blasting lol.\nDo I really hate this product? No, not for the price but some design issues could use more thought and tweaking and the sound needs BASS!\nI have enjoyed this little speaker but it’s just not what I was looking for. I live for amazon reviews and and it has such a high amount of reviews I thought “hey, why not”. Considering my needs I will be looking for another Bluetooth speaker."},{"reviewerName":"Tati pleasant","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"LOUD and LOVELY","reviewDate":"January 30, 2019","reviewText":"Item arrived on time and in perfect shape.

Although the sound quality rates as a 4, for some bizarre reason they decided to put the speaker on the bottom, which means you have to turn it upside down for good sound quality (thus blocking the controls). Minus one star. I dropped it on the wood floor and it appears ok. So keeps a star for that. The battery life so far appears to be ok but I'm seeing a lot of reviews that said their units stopped charging after a couple weeks, so the jury's out on that. The biggest drawback is that my husband ONLY bought this b/c it said it connected to the Amazon Echo, which maybe it does, but it DOES NOT CONNECT TO THE ECHO DOT. And one reviewer said it did--but maybe he/she doesn't know the difference between an Echo and Echo Dot? Or we got a defective unit. And lastly, a week after we bought it, they dropped the price $5.

When it’s turned up all the way the vibrations cause it to move across the table, but it’s still not that loud. When I have the speaker in the right position, with the logo facing front, and the ‘volume up’ button at the top, which shows the ‘play’ button in the correct direction, the ‘skip’ buttons are backwards. The forward ‘skip’ button skips to the last song and the backward ‘skip’ button skips to the next song, so that’s kind of shitty and weird.

Why?","reviewDate":"July 14, 2018","reviewText":"I bought this Bluetooth speaker because it has the same dimensions as the Echo Dot. Amazon sells many mounts and accessories for the dot, so I purchased this $15 speaker to take advantage of those accesssories.\n\nI have owned three other Bluetooth speakers, none of which had bottom-facing speakers. Sonically speaking, this is a terrible design concept, as the sound is ALWAYS obstructed, muffled, or has the undesired tin-can effect.\n\nThe easy fix: Flip the speaker upside down with the speakers facing up. Once upside down, the sound significantly improves. It’s not perfect clarity, but certainly worthy of a $15 price tag.\n\nUltimately, I wanted a speaker that would fit in an ECHO DOT wall mount, and this does the trick. I will have to slide it into the mount “upside down” with the speakers facing out. I will also have to slide it out of the mount when I need to adjust the controls. Not the end of the world, but certainly not ideal; hence the three stars."},{"reviewerName":"J.

There is one problem but I think it is more with my Samsung galaxy E Tab. The soundtrack of most, not all, videos is slightly out of synch, especially on YouTube.

It came with a charging and aux cord... yes it holds a charge and is ready for use straight out of the box. The speaker will audibly let you know when it is turned on, paired, disconnected, turning off, or in need of charging. You do have the ability to listen and charge at the same time which I have only done once. It is portable and serves dual purposes for both my home and work.

It's small, inconspicuous and the battery lasts all day. Overall, I'm satisfied with the purchase. That being said, there are a few things to note. 1) Given that the speaker is on the bottom of the device, the sound comes out a bit \"tinny\" - not very much base at all. However, for what I bought it for, the quality is acceptable. 2) A sound is played when turning the device on that is a bit annoying. Everyone around me knows when the speaker comes on. I wish it were a bit softer or eliminated altogether. 3) The SD card feature is nice, but it would be better if there were a shuffle option. It just plays the songs in order from the top down. Also, the lowest volume setting when using the SD card is still a bit loud for use in the office. These are just a few things to note.

It's perfect. The sound is amplified and takes on a deeper quality in that configuration. As a bonus, but controls are totally accessible - right on top with just a fingertip of pressure to begin, pause, or change volume. It has been an extraordinary asset as a lightweight device to provide sound. I teach tai chi and need easy access to on/off and volume control quickly and accessibly. This unit has been ideal. Battery life is terrific (and an icon shows its charge level on your phone so no surprises). It's very small (in my purse) and connects immediately to Bluetooth. It will even run with the phone on Airplane Mode (important to not have phone interruptions when teaching)."},{"reviewerName":"M.

At the maximum volume setting, it performs alright for the most part. At some points the sound quality becomes unclear, almost muffled/blurry sounding for some reason. By lowering the volume, the song becomes clear again. The problem seems to only occur when the speaker is at its loudest setting.\n\nAnother thing is the beeping. The speaker will beep to let you know when the volume is completely maxed, or muted, while you're adjusting the volume; and also as a warning before the voice will notify you of its low battery status. However, sometimes it randomly beeps while playing music for no apparent reason. I'm not adjusting the volume high or low, and the battery life will be just fine, but it just beeps while playing music. I'm not sure what that's about.\n\nI was also surprised that the rewind/forward buttons are reversed. Pressing rewind, and the speaker will move onto the next song on shuffle/whichever song is next on the playlist. And by hitting forward, it either replays the current song or goes to the previous song. That didn't take too long to get used to, but it is backwards on this speaker.\n\nThere seems to be a good battery life on it, it's as expected and lasts a decent duration of time. Of course, keep in mind how loud you're playing it, as that will impact the battery life.\n\nSo my only real problem is with the clarity of the music when the speaker is maxed out in volume, along with the random beeping. The music will be playing just fine, only to randomly become static-like and I don't know why it does that. I suppose that for the price, it's not too bad?"},{"reviewerName":"NewAvidReader","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Bluetooth speaker to use with Echo dot","reviewDate":"December 29, 2018","reviewText":"OK, this is an attractive, small speaker that sounds pretty darn good compared to the Echo Dot.

However, with the unit having speakers on the bottom side, the sound has to bounce off of the surface it’s sitting on, which doesn’t effect the volume, but it gives it a sound as if it’s sitting in a can. Kind of tinny, or just a little off. If sound quality is a thing for you, you will likely notice. I ended up using the clamshell case that is made for it, and I just leave the speaker pointing up in the case, which makes the controls inaccessible. For the price and sound quality when I use it that way, I can use the controls on my phone. The battery seems to last a long time. I streamed pandora almost the entire day and my battery indicator showed barely a blip in the hit to the battery. The pair process is super easy.\n\nSpeaking of pairing, I ordered a second one to use in my classroom, and a feature I wish this had was the ability to change the name of the device in my iPhone Bluetooth settings.

Who would believe it belongs to a man? Nobody. Even my wife commented: \"Why would you buy that color? It's a girl's color.\" I responded: \"Oh ye of little taste...\" When I pull this speaker out of my pocket, it's all flowers and sunshine. Does it work? Yes, it works well. But I had to buy a new iPhone to make it work. The price was excellent; the seller was top notch and I only had to buy a new phone to make it work. But that was inevitable. My iPhone 6+ was \"obsolete\" according to the salesman, when I asked why I couldn't connect to my beautiful new speaker. Whenever I'd dial a number, dinosaurs would answer.

Some of the mini speakers have way too much light show for me, I just want to know if it's on or charging. It's a hefty little speaker and has little rubber bumpers underneath that keep it put where you set it. The speaker is located on the bottom, but the bumpers raise it up so the speaker grill is up off the table a bit, and I actually think it enhances the sound as it bounces off the table. Some reviewers say they set it speaker side up, but I don't think the sound is as full that way.\n\nIt charged well and it's nice that it included the charging cable and also an audio cable, for when you don't want to use bluetooth. Be aware that the charging cable has a usb end, not a plug for a wall socket, but any wall plug off a phone charger will work, or you can plug it into your laptop to charge.\n\nThe only thing that kept it from getting a full five stars from me is the light that shows when it is playing. It has a small blue light that flashes on and off when the bluetooth is connected and audio is playing. If you're using it at night in a dark room, it would be very distracting. However, it is not as bright as some speaker lights I've seen, and I realize this may be an issue just for me. Because of where the light is located near the bottom, the light comes out through the charging port as well as that part of the speaker, so it's not possible to simply block it off with tape. But like I said, this might be just a thing with me, and also it's not blindingly bright. If I could give fractional stars, I would give it more like 4.8. :)\n\nThe voice telling you when it's powered on or bluetooth paired is kind of amusing. I didn't think it was too loud at all. The instructions are a little cryptic, but it's a bluetooth speaker, not too difficult to get working, lol.\n\nI just got this yesterday so I can't really speak to its durability. If it fails, I will update, but if there's no update, you can assume it's still working well. I liked this speaker and think it was a great purchase.\n\nUpdate: I still love this speaker, in fact I enjoy it so much I bought a second one to use to listen to my phone in the car (I have an old car without all those fancy-schmancy ways to hook a phone into the radio speakers).

Then I opened the instructions.\nIf they don’t want bad reviews, they really need a new translator. Photo shows what I was trying to read before I gave up and decided to “wing” it. When I got the speaker to talk to me, “she” has a heavy accent. Now, if she were speaking full sentences you’d probably get the gist. But with individual words and phrases I had to listen to it several times before I knew what it was saying. I feel I owe it to other shoppers to share."},{"reviewerName":"Melissa S.","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"JUNK!!","reviewDate":"August 22, 2019","reviewText":"I liked this speaker for the most part. The one thing that kinda bothered me was the speaker being on the bottom but it didn't interfere with the sound quality. I loved the rose gold color and I liked that I could talk through the speaker which came in really handy since I clean for a living and I'm always wearing rubber gloves so I didn't have to take them off to pick up my phone. I liked that it was wireless so I could move it around with me as I moved from room to room. Sadly after barely 2 weeks it just stopped working therefore it's being returned and I will spend my money on a different speaker."},{"reviewerName":"haute glue gun","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Fake.

It is well manufactured, sturdy and has great features (although I guess my view of what should be the face is different from the manufacturer, causing some confusion as to which was the skip and back buttons!) It felt quite solid in my hand and I was looking forward to using the speaker... until I actually started playing music on it. I was quite disappointed to hear the same, tinny sound that comes from small speakers. I might as well have saved my money and played the music on my phone. There was very little bass and I'm sorry I purchased it. Next time I buy something like this, I'm going to get it in my hands and try it out first!"},{"reviewerName":"Ezyubu","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"The battery life is great and the found quality is crisp and perfect and its small and concealable.","reviewDate":"February 3, 2019","reviewText":"I bought it as a gift for my wife and she loves it. She loves that the sound is loud and the bass is crisp. She is a huge fan of rose gold so she loves the color. Haven’t had any issues with the battery not lasting. So that is a plus. No issues with connecting to her iPhone. The product is all around great. I also bought the rose gold case and it fits perfect!

But I love this thing so much that I carry it around the house to use with nearly everything. It pairs very quickly and the sound is very good, though I'm much more frequently watching internet TV or listening to podcasts than music. I find it sounds best on a solid surface like furniture. The speaker is on the bottom, which some complained about, but it is elevated, and the ability to bounce the sound off a solid surface improves the sound, in my opinion. Putting it on the couch or bed, it doesn't do as well. Battery lasts a long time. Only thing I find annoying is the little voice that sounds like \"Pavva on\" and \"Pavva off\" (power on/off) and \"Peered\" (paired). It's kind of like the Captain Obvious of speakers. I wish it would tell me how much battery life is left, which is not obvious! But that's a minor complaint, great speaker for the money."},{"reviewerName":"WG Damion","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Awesome Equiptment","reviewDate":"January 29, 2019","reviewText":"Sounds like a speaker 5 times the price easy to carry I love the hockey puck design and I've dropped it several times barely scratched and works like the day I got it :-)"},{"reviewerName":"Bre Magee","rating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"I’m sorely disappointed with this purchase.","reviewDate":"May 31, 2019","reviewText":"At first, I was extremely excited with this purchase as the purpose was to take it with me on vacation. However, upon using it for the first time for music, I found 1) the speaker is located at the bottom of the device; therefore, the sound is very muffled. If you try to turn it upside down, then you risk pressing the buttons at the top. 2) I can hear my callers clearly; however, to them, I always sound as if I’m underwater. I’m very familiar with the saying “You get what you pay for.” However, I feel someone really dropped the ball with the design of this product. Very disappointed.

I haven’t even had the speaker for a full week. I’ve had it 5-days and 5-days of usage is not long enough to gage the cumulative quality as these change over time. Battery life can be significantly less on day 20 vs day 2, effecting sound over distances, etc.. Hence the current rating. I’d like to point out that others have pointed out there were issues with the battery and I have yet to listen to it charging be it a portable charger or plugged in, however it’s back to class tomorrow so no charging.

Don't expect to be able to use this upside down, though, because the top is touch sensitive to any flat surface, it seems. Also, you can't prop this up against anything because it's very smooth and slides off.\n\nI can't place the accent of the voice responses to mode changes and powering on/off, but it can be hard to understand, and I feel like they could have paid any native American-English speaker on the street a few bucks to make a better voice for the speaker."},{"reviewerName":"Ingrid H.","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"The Little Speaker That Dreams Are Made Of","reviewDate":"November 7, 2019","reviewText":"This fine little speaker fulfills all the basic tenets of tiny bluetooth speakers that probably brought you to this page:\n+ Sound Quality. Of course, this is the first question. It has a wide range, never rattles, squawks or buzzes. In fact, the audio quality remains surprisingly clean even while charging it, which is more than I can say for most other similar devices I've used in the past.\n+ Portability. It's about 2\" in diameter by 1\" tall, and even comes with a nice quality carrying pouch - which was a great touch.\n+ Bluetooth connectivity. Easy to connect & respectable range, though I haven't conducted proper empirical tests on the range, it's never fallen short of my needs - i.e. roaming from room to room with my phone while leaving the speaker in a central location on the same floor.\n+ Volume. Loud enough for a hard of hearing person to understand dialectic whispery dialogue from period cinema while sitting across the room in front of a fan, so that's loud enough for basically any conceivable, healthy indoor use and most outdoor occasions concentrated around, say, a picnic area.\n\nThe only thing I don't care for, and it's very minor (and not unique to this product/brand/model), is the robotic voice that announces itself when you fire up the power. It's not a very pleasant or intelligible voice, and is usually a little louder than I'd like it to be. This is no reason not to buy so much as it is a note to the developers, should they ever parse these reviews."},{"reviewerName":"Brett","rating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great sound, but not the best quality","reviewDate":"November 30, 2017","reviewText":"I was so excited to get this that I was watching like a creep waiting for the UPS man to come. I opened it immediately and paired it after plugging it in to charge. It’s surprising how much sound this little dude has! I will say it works better upside down. I listen to music that had lots of different levels of sounds and didn’t really feel I could experience them all without them being muffled upsight right. Upside down though, it works very well. I turned it up super loud to see how it would do and it was great and pretty darn clear! I will mention that in another room at high volume, I didn’t know it needed to be upside down. This was only when I was right next to it that I felt it sounded muffled. I have a fine tuned ear and can only detect a little feedback and it might just be the songs I’m listening to. Overall, happy, but kind of wishing I’d gone with a product that had the speaker on top so I wouldn’t scratch the top with it always being upside down.\n\nUPDATE REVIEW: while the sound is ok, I will be sending this product back. Every time I turn it on, it talks in this thick accented voice that tells me I need to pair, things have been paired, disconnected etc. it doesn’t have hardly a 20 foot range from my phone (I was walking around my ridiculously small apartment and it disconnected) and then, when the phone was right beside it, it randomly disconnected for no reason. Every time I pick it up, the buttons get pushed (by the corner of my phone this time) and songs get skipped or stopped. Anywho, you get what you pay for and I’ll be returning to use my money on a higher quality item."},{"reviewerName":"T Dowdell","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Awesome sound!","reviewDate":"January 30, 2019","reviewText":"I purchased this speaker to use at a school.

For the cost, it was perfect. I use this for my classroom transitions. I play short clips of music or other sounds as cues for students to know when to begin a classroom routine/procedure. I also like that it plays the sounds on my classroom management system. The class will hear the sounds when positive or negative points is awarded on our digital behavior system. Because they don’t see their points until they are home with families, students hear the sounds and check their behavior to see if the sounds were for them. It’s a nice way to redirect or affirm behavior without having to say anything or point out specific students. When we are working in small groups, I play study music. This speaker can be LOUD! I can’t believe the volume it can achieve when it’s so small. The color (rose gold) is pretty and luxe looking. I haven’t had issues pairing my iPhone with it. The charge keeps well. I think it lasts about a day and a half with al day use (8+ hours). I recommend this speaker."},{"reviewerName":"David W Box","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"The Speakers Work Great!!","reviewDate":"February 5, 2019","reviewText":"The two speakers we bought from you, are easy to play, and the music or stories are clear no skipping or other noise.

I had just purchased one at a local retailer and the battery life lasted literally 3 hours so I was in search of something that I could keep on my desk so I can listen while I work and the battery didn't need to be charged every hour. Well this is the product! I have been telling everyone about it and I have another one on my list because I will be purchasing another one. I love the ability to change the volume on the speaker itself and it doesn't change the volume setting on my phone. A MUST GET! I got this on a Friday, used it about an hour on Saturday & Sunday, then all day Monday, all day Tuesday, started it at 7 AM this morning and just NOW had to charge it (it's 12:30 PM) so needless to say the battery life on this is pretty damn great.\n\n**Update** Removed a star because if you have two devices linked (my iphone and my ipad) it will link to the last device used and if you try to link the other device you can't. You have to remove forget the device on the one that you don't want and then reconnect the device you do want. My other speakers I'm able to just connect to the one that I want by disconnecting it instead of forgetting the device. It's annoying because then you have to repair the device.

I was finding myself leaning into the computer to listen to audio, so this was a perfect upgrade from the built-in laptop speakers. It looks cute, matches my computer, and sounds great. And under $20? Great deal. I also purchased the matching carrying case, as I think I'll bring it with me when traveling. So far the charge has been holding up pretty well, so I don't always have to look at the wires. I didn't give it 5 stars because the sound isn't like a Bose speaker- the speaker is on the bottom of the disc, and it doesn't necessarily have a rich sound. For the money, you won't be disappointed.

I dod not like the touch feature. Prefer switches that let me easily see the status (if they are on/off, high/low, etc.).

It is quite little (about the size of an Echo Dot) but the sound quality is great for the size. It does get a little grainy if it's too far away from the bluetooth source, but otherwise works great.

I've found that a bottom speaker is no big deal, however, you can just flip the hockey puck speaker over and now the speaker is on the top. That does increase volume a little bit, but really isn't needed, as the sound is adequate for most applications. The package includes the hockey puck speaker, a USB recharger cable and an additional cable that appears to be an aux cable.

The other speaker is the OontZAangle3. Comparing the two, the XLEADER has greater range and the control buttons are easier to see. The XLEADER is smaller than the Angle3 and easier to move around.

It is loud but the speaker is placed at the bottom where it projects off of whatever surface you place it, which makes the sound awkward and have a high pitched yet muffled sound. There is not really any bass but it does seem to play better off the phone through Bluetooth than being hooked to the TV. It can be a bit shrill which is my biggest complaint but for what I paid I am happier than other speakers I've bought. It's not bad but also it's not the best. I would not buy it again but I'm also not brooding over the money I spent.

I now have the speaker on top of the Dot because it has rubber feet/nubs on the bottom, and prevents it from sliding off. You can also still see the Alexa Dot Light Ring when they are stacked too.

Based on other reviews I read, I believed that the sound quality would be “good”. The sound quality is poor. As a professional musician, I’d have to say I have high standards and I should have remembered that “you get what you pay for”. I’ve heard it because I was only able to make a Bluetooth connection with my iPhone 8; establishing a working connection with the Dot never happened . I knew the Dot and the speaker were communicating only because of the silence that resulted when I attempted to connect it with the Dot, which had been playing before my attempts. The instructions that came with the speaker were gibberish; here is a random exact quote from the instructions for the speaker: “Our Bluetooth stereo stereo scheme, so the requirements of the Bluetooth audio switch, but also to ensure that Bluetooth.” I might have given this speaker two stars for the poor sound quality alone if I had been able to connect with more than just my iPhone.

You can't prop it on its side since it's wheel-shaped, and turning it upside down both disconnects the device and hides all the control buttons.

I was just a happy to see that it came with a charging cord and an audio plug, as well as a nice little carry bag. However, I had already spent the money and purchased the Hermitshell Hard Travel Case for it. Another great buy. Not only is the size and color perfect, but the sound quality is just as great for a speaker of its size. You can pair this with your phone, your computer/laptop, or even your Echo Dot and Kindle. Granted, I’ve only paired it with my iPhone so far. And! It has a microphone. I could actually answer a call while it was on. I had to speak closer to the mic so the person on the other could hear me better, but still. Also, I don’t know how to use it, but there is a micro SD card reader you can play your music that way too. The speaker will support MP3, WMA, and WAV. I couldn’t give a rating on the battery life as I haven’t worn it down just yet. But I foresee draining it everyday.

It wasn't until we got this speaker that we realized that he didn't just not like going to bed but had a major fear of the dark.\n\nBut after downloading sleep music (12 hour loop) and playing it on this...nothing! No cries, no pounding on walls, no screaming!\n\nAny speaker would have done the job, but the reason I like this is because of the micro sd slot. Bluetooth is great but when you need music to be played all night, it kills the battery on my phone. Not only that but I cannot do anything else while the YouTube app is on.\n\nBattery life is also fantastic. Plays throughout the night.\n\nThe actual speaker is on the bottom which is a strange design choice, which also mufflers the sound a bit. However, just flipping the device over should solve that. Or maybe that is what they intended. Either way it's not a big deal.\n\nAlso, this device has a pause, skip and back button. If you are connected via Bluetooth it will skip to the next song on your phone or on YouTube.\n\nSound:\n\nSound is amazing. Right now, it's not even at it's maximum and I can hear it from across the house. I'm not a huge audiophile but it sounds great.\n\nFor any parents out there who are struggling to get their toddlers/babies to bed, buy this!\n\nAnother thing I bought was a light projector, which helped, however, the speaker really was what brought the most comfort.\n\nThank you!"},{"reviewerName":"Donna Mitchell","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"What a GREAT little Bluetooth speaker!!!","reviewDate":"October 17, 2019","reviewText":"I am a little technically \"challenged\"... really just clueless about Bluetooth and a lot of technology. But, I wanted a better sound experience with my Fire HD 8 tablet (which I love!) so I did my homework researching wireless speakers. I don't recall where I found out about your product, probably one of many reviews that I read. But, I liked the design... and really good price - about 60% cheaper than my next choice!\n\nUpon arrival (on time!), I opened and followed the simple, well-written instructions in the nicely-packaged box... and, might also have referred to a YouTube video for assurance. But, set up was quick & easy. In minutes, Spotify was filling the space with glorious music. I couldn't be more pleased!\n\nNext week, I will buy a second one (as I've noticed my taking it with me at the end of the workday / no need for that). It will find a happy home on my desk, next to my computer."},{"reviewerName":"MzDeDe1","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Love this speaker","reviewDate":"February 2, 2019","reviewText":"This speaker packs a lot of sound and the battery life is great.

It comes with a nice pouch to carry everything in. The USB charger cable worked with the wall charger I use for my phone, excellent! This was exactly what I needed. I am tired of listening to the radio (same songs over & over, plus radio ads). I used the bluetooth to pair with my phone, which I have music stored on an SD Card. I had it playing for about 9 hours before I was alerted of a low battery (by voice). Although the speaker is on the bottom, there are small raised padded feet on it, so it isn't really going to rest flat against a surface. I am lucky, the shelf I have is the wire kind, so it's all open BUT I do think the sound would be excellent on any surface. The touch screen is nice, a light touch is all ya need.

It can get very loud and the neighbors can vouche for that, but the speaker has very weak bass, not a big deal breaker but something that could be improved on for a little extra charge.\n\n4. Price. This is honestly an amazing speaker for the price, after shipping and tax charges my total order was only $23 dollars, if you want something to toy around with this is for you.\n\n5. It’s extremely portable, it’s about the size of a hockey puck and very light, it comes with its own mini carrying pouch too.\n\nIt also came with a very short but useable USB cable and a small AUX cord.\nI’ll update this review if it breaks prematurely or I encounter any issues, so far, it’s 5 stars for me."},{"reviewerName":"Leigh E.

IMHO, I think bass might take a shine to Johnny Cash. Trout, maybe Stevie Nick's. I digress. This speaker is wonderful! Easily recognized by Fire and Android phone. Short charging time, long battery life, good sound for small device. Well appointed with carrying case, all the cables you need (like 3.5 audio even). A small point... Call me a dingbat if you must. There are little felt scratch protectors on \"the bottom\" of the speaker, so I assumed the actual LED \"buttons\" of the speaker should be facing up. LOLs on me. Turn it over for the greatness of the speaker. PS...I gave it four stars instead of five, just because I wish the volume went louder at times.

If you have the speaker on a hard surface like a kitchen counter, it accentuates the treble, so try to put something soft under it to dampen the treble.

The Rose Gold color is wonderful with a nice sheen to it, and the touch screen LED lights are nice and bright. The overall quality of the speaker is high with no warping, crunch, or otherwise unnecessary secondary sounds whenever I play my music, even when I blast it to the highest volume. Speaking of which, this thing has some strength too it, it's nice and bassy and can get fairly loud with the volume set high, which is impressive. Battery life is tremendous, lasting for overall 8 hours. I do have two complaints however - The touch screen is a little delayed or insensitive to touch, as it takes awhile for it to respond when you use the screen. The design is also... Kind of annoying. The speaker is located underneath the touch screen, and the sound will come out weird because it's probably going to be emitted against a hard surface you put it on. I bought a case for my speaker and leave it flipped over to best sound quality and reach.

He had asked for a portable Bluetooth speaker but later told me he didn’t really think he’d get it. It was just one of the things on his list. He used it on Christmas evening, and we were all really impressed with the sound quality and even the level of bass coming out of that tiny little speaker.

I was looking for something small and portable for the office but wanted something that could put out the kind of sound quality I wanted (and didn't burn a hole through my wallet). Love the rose gold color that it came in. Easy to use and it really does pack a punch when it comes to sound. I flip the speaker facing upwards so the sound is more intense.

It charges really well and lasts a long time. My only issue is the fact that the speakers being on the bottom, get muffled very easily. The legs on the speaker are too small so it doesn't keep the speaker from sitting directly on top of whatever surface it's on and that muffles the sound. I'm going to add some height to the feet if possible to see if it helps. Other than that it's worth it."},{"reviewerName":"Rein","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"good sound quality","reviewDate":"November 15, 2018","reviewText":"the sound volume range is wide. can go very quiet to very loud yet having good sounds.

I use this for my classroom, and it is perfect to use as a background noise during writing/reading/independent time that students are focusing. When it's at full volume it's not the best quality of sound, but it is most definitely LOUD. No issues there.\n\nI usually place this with the speaker down against a hard surface with the buttons up, since I need quick access to those when moving from subject to subject. When speaker down against a cushioned/soft surface it is considerably muted, but that would happen with ANY speaker placed in that situation (simple physics).\n\nThe play/pause option is a little delayed, and the volume up button has to be closest to you to skip to the next song (just fyi). However, for me, this did not necessitate a lower rating.\n\nOverall, amazing quality! I may buy another for only personal use, since I have already forgotten it at home once and regretted it deeply that day when I could only use my (honestly) crappy projector and computer sound.

Admittedly, I also don't use it daily, but that's still about a hundred times the battery life my little Bluetooth earbuds have. Only complaint is that the speaker itself is on the bottom of the product, so when you sit it down on a table, the sound distorts a little bit—and since the controls are touch-activated and not button-buttons, if I flip it upside down on a surface, it has a tendency to pause itself."},{"reviewerName":"Belle Nkamhoua","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"A2 LENRUE Portable Wireless Bluetooth Speaker Is much better.","reviewDate":"December 2, 2018","reviewText":"Keeping this to gift to a coworker since it’s no point in returning.

Thus I changed my search phrase and found this little speaker and it's absolutely perfect. Though small, this little speaker emits a LOUD, crystal clear, sound which is just enough for my home office space. I've been streaming music on Pandora, watching YouTube videos, etc and the sound is just great. It's performed impressively well for my teleconference meetings which is the primary reason I purchased this speaker. I can hear my clients and they can hear me very well.\n\nThis device comes equipped with a short USB cable for charging, but not a wall charger. So, if you happen to have an extra wall charger lying around, keep it. Or, you may want to purchase a wall charger at the same time you purchase this speaker.There is also an audio cable for wired sound if you need/prefer.\n\nIt was relatively easy to pair with my laptop, but I did have some trouble getting sound to play. Strangely enough, it was until I plugged in the USB cable that sound suddenly started blaring out. I was startled and impressed at the same time. I unplugged the USB and the sound has been working perfectly ever since. It powers on quickly, indicated by a brief jingle. After which, a woman's voice announces \"Bluetooth mode\". \"Pairing\". \"Paired\". It's never failed to pair or emit sound since the first day and I feel confident it will last for a long time. I love that the control buttons sit right on top of the speaker, and are literally controlled by tapping them.\n\nThe size is perfect given the limited space on my desk.

As a graduate student, I play songs from laptop and listen to the songs from the speaker via bluetooth by putting away from my study table. It helps me create a relaxed study environment.

Hope this resolves itself."},{"reviewerName":"teach","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Not my favorite but looks good","reviewDate":"August 31, 2019","reviewText":"I bought this for my office hoping to get rid of my big desk speakers. The size and look are great! I got the rose gold and love the tone.\n\nHowever, here are my frustrations with this speaker: 1. The sound is really tinny with the buttons facing up (like when you put your phone in a cup to make the sound louder). It's not bad with the speaker side up, but then I have to pick it up to use the buttons. This is very disappointing as I was hoping for something with good sound quality. 2. The turn-off time seems pretty short and can't be changed. Going in and out of my office so often, I wish it would stay on for a few minutes so I didn't have to turn it back on Everytime I come back in."},{"reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Adorable!","reviewDate":"July 3, 2019","reviewText":"I knew based on reviews that this speaker would be small, but it can easily fit in a pocket. For it's size, it gives out pretty great sound even with the speaker being on the bottom. I love the SD card port and the AUX cord for my ipod so I don't waste the battery on my phone using Bluetooth.

I have purchased 2 or 3 other brands. Some were just poor quality and none of the others had an adjustable volume button. They were totally dependent on the volume adjustment from my phone which only goes so loud. This one has great sound and will adjust to a very high volume.\nSmall and compact but has enough weight (on rubber grip on bottom) so it won't slide around. Very Happy with this purchase."},{"reviewerName":"CJ12","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Would be better if speaker wasn't on bottom","reviewDate":"August 13, 2019","reviewText":"This item is good, but I would have rated it 5 stars if the speaker wasn't on the bottom of the device. Why? Because it is muffled if you have it on anything (even a solid surface) and sounds horrible. I have to turn it upside down to hear it perfectly but sometimes the touch pad hits itself on its own and changes the song and/or stops. So that part is quite annoying. The sound quality overall is loud for such a little device which is great. I just wish they put the speaker on the side or on the top."},{"reviewerName":"J.

Recently I start to use it on daily bases, it works good for news and music, but when I use it for language learning, for some lessons, it was frequently eating some words, or only speak out half of a word, this happens like every 2 seconds out of 6 seconds, while it works fine for other lessons.

However, this product is already falling apart. The speaker is on the bottom first of all. I don’t like this feature at all and it makes the sound coming through the speaker muffled. In addition, the small pad things on the bottom of the speaker have fallen off in the first couple of weeks I have had it. I have tried to flip the speaker over to get a better sound quality, yet, the buttons (sound, skip, disconnect, pause) are so sensitive that the speaker just disconnects.

Unfortunately, the speaker is the bottom of the unit, so sound goes directly into the surface it's sitting on. I turned it upside down so speaker is facing up, but the control buttons are on the top and are flush with the body, so music kept fast forwarding. I finally put adhesive \"feet\" on the top, so it can be placed upside down when in use and it works fine. Looks dumb with the feet on it when not in use tho.

This means when you place it on a table, or anywhere else, the sound is projected into the table underneath creating a muffled sound. It's fine for the price and not worth returning for me, but I definitely wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Yes, it's small and cute, but in order for me to not get annoyed with the sound quality, i have to prop it up and point the speaker at me so it doesn't matter how cute it is when I only see the bottom speaker at that point. When I listen to it that way, the sound quality is a little tinny, but I would have been fine with it for the price if it sounded like that when used as designed."},{"reviewerName":"Tanesha","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Love this Speaker","reviewDate":"February 3, 2019","reviewText":"I really like the sound quality and battery life of this speaker that I ordered three.

There is no point in purchasing a speaker that sounds terrible, period. The sounds very good. It's relatively small, about 4 inches in diameter and 1.5 inches deep. Vocals, guitars, most synths come through loud, clear, and distinct. Even though small, the bass is clearly audible in the sound profile, though not loud or driving. You will hear the bass, but not feel it in any way. Their small size makes them the perfect travel companion.

I wish they were designed a little better as the speaker is on the bottom and the sound quality is better if I turn the speaker over. Overall, I am really impressed with this purchase. My girls love them.

Lol) it's ok for the price. But you do get what you pay for. It doesn't last long if not plugged in (even after charging all night) and if you like rap music as much as I do, I would pay more for something else. Rap music doesn't sound great on this speaker, the bass doesn't come through and if you turn it up too high it sounds a little muffled. Other music has ok sound quality. It's fine for the price, but in hindsight I kind of wish I'd payed a little more for something else."},{"reviewerName":"Margaret","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Small but powerful","reviewDate":"December 12, 2018","reviewText":"I bought 12 of them for Christmas gifts..This baby has a very good range so one can carry it around the house.and listen favorite music while a phone is charging.

Sound is very crisp. The only reason for 4 stars in the sound rating was the bass quality. In a speaker this size a resonant bass is not possible. I charged it once and have been using it every morning for about an hour all week! Very user friendly. My music source is my computer and I use the speaker all over our home.It works well in our bedroom that is in the opposite end of our home. Something that a speaker I purchased earlier for more than $100 couldn’t do. This speaker does everything that I hoped it would.

I use this with my tablet to watch videos while I’m doing dishes or cleaning up the house. If you are like me and you just need your tablet or phone to be a lot louder than it’s internal factory installed speakers, then this is the speaker for you.

I like it a lot."},{"reviewerName":"Nanette","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"It works great","reviewDate":"June 17, 2019","reviewText":"I bought this little speaker for my office.

Came with all accessories. It's a good size, the sound is good for the price I paid. A few times I had trouble pairing it with my devices (which is why I gave it 3 stars), but after a few restarts of turning bluetooth on/off and the speaker off/on, it worked fine. It didn't always auto-shut off consistently. Battery life was great- at least a week of using before needed a charge. For the price though, it gets the job done and it's a decent sounding little speaker."},{"reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Good sound and convenient","reviewDate":"August 28, 2019","reviewText":"Simple and easy to use. The sound is just right for bedrooms and bathrooms. For the price, it’s great. The only annoying thing is that it talks to you when you turn it on and when it powers off. If not being used, it will suddenly say “powering off” in this woman’s voice which is terrifying."},{"reviewerName":"Danielle Sefczek","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"It's not worth the cost","reviewDate":"July 8, 2019","reviewText":"Yeah it's cheap.

Horrible."},{"reviewerName":"blondie47","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Loved it!","reviewDate":"April 2, 2019","reviewText":"Loved this speaker as soon as it came! It arrived in 2 days which was pretty unexpected since I dknt have prime. It works so well and is so cute. This speaker last for so long without needing to be charged and the sound is great! I love the color and the fact that it is tiny and portable! My only complaint is not about the speaker but that about after a week the seller sent me an email asking to write them a review which I ignored. Then a week later they sent a second email asking to write a review which I also ignored. Then again 2 weeks later they sent another email asking me to write them a review which i am doing right now.

That has no appeal to me. This is going back! I'd advise anyone who thinks this has a good sound to listen to another one... ANY other one.

So far it's been amazing. I haven't exactly tried it out as loud as it can be, but it works fantastic at the level I need it to. As far as battery goes, I used it for two 9 hour work days and about a hour or two into the third day before needing to charge. So that's pretty awesome.

Speakers are on the bottom. If this is sitting upright (buttons on top) as intended the sound is muffled and sounds like you’re listening to an old radio from long ago. To get an “okay” sound - you have to flip the speaker upside down, which then renders the buttons pointless (since they’re now on the bottom), and even then the sound is subpar.

It won’t disappoint!"},{"reviewerName":"Aaron Grech","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great bargain for the price","reviewDate":"July 5, 2019","reviewText":"While more professional Bluetooth speakers hold better sound quality, the speaker is a bargain for the price. It plays loudly, and is portable enough to carry anywhere easily. Definitely recommended for those who want a decent quality speaker, on a budget."},{"reviewerName":"Jenn B.","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Incredibly easy set up","reviewDate":"April 19, 2019","reviewText":"Great little portable speaker, sinks up to Bluetooth immediately with no issue, sound quality is about 3 1/2, which is expected on a speaker so small."},{"reviewerName":"painbuster","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Four Stars","reviewDate":"June 14, 2018","reviewText":"very good purchase.
