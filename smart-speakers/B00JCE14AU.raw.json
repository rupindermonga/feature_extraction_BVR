However, they run on a separate app from all the other Sengled lighting products and unfortunately, there are a lot of bugs. For one, if they are not in use - you will not be able to use the app to turn them all back on. Even if you turn the lights off with the app and leave the light switch on, the Sengled app will NOT recognize the bulbs if switched off for 30mins/hour. You have to go around to each area (starting with the master bulb) switch the lights off and on again - an then the app will pick them up. The Sengled Home app which operates their other products works seamlessly with Alexa. The app that powers these bulbs does NOT -- or at least I haven't had any luck with it. If you have the speaker bulbs and other Sengled products -- you have to use separate apps to operate them. That being said, for a small apartment, the inconvenience of flipping a few switches off and on to get the app to work isn't a huge problem -- but I would definitely think twice for a larger space. Hopefully, Sengled will get some of this worked out - it would be nice to operate all their products from one app."},{"reviewerName":"Silly Yak","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Oh!My!Ears!","reviewDate":"May 6, 2019","reviewText":"I bought these for 20 bucks on sale (red master and satellite set).

What I like about theses bulbs. They fit recessed lighting cans and look good. The app features like dimming lights and using the preset eq options. The speakers sound pretty good especially the mids and highs. Able to pair speakers (subwoofer or same bulbs) and add more. Able to control sound for each speaker. Able to use bluetooth from tv, phone, tablet or any device that sends bluetooth signals. Wireless!!!! Space saving by elimating soundbars and wired satellite speakers that sit on end tables or attached to walls. What I dont like about these are: Can add only 8 total speakers. Which means I cant fill up all 12 cans and rock the house lol. Only one color option for led which is white. I would like to be able to use multi colored leds and maybe different party modes to rotate through colors and flashing lights. Overall these are great sounding speaker lights. I will be adding a sub and 2 more satellite speakers for a more complete robust sound for this room."},{"reviewerName":"nicole Joseph","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Wow! Awesome product!","reviewDate":"November 3, 2018","reviewText":"Wow! This is an awesome product; worth the money. Easy to install, worked immediately in my can lights; the Pulse lights are indistinguishable from ordinary light bulbs. I was worried that the light quality would be cold, but it is warm. The app is easy to use and dims the bulbs from 100 to 0. So, the light switch needs to be on for the music to play, but via the app you can turn the light source off. The master bulbs switch needs to be on for the system to work, but you can turn other satellite bulb light switches on and off to control if music is on in certain rooms. (I can have the master and satellite bulbs on in my living room, but turn off the switches in my dining room to have that room be silent.)\n\nJust to clarify how this system works (I was a bit confused): I bought the PULSE master and satellite starter kit, then added additional Pulse satellite bulbs to get music in multiple rooms on the same floor of my house. You can have 7 bulbs linked with the master.\n\nI initially bought the solo pro, which does not connect to other bulbs. This would be ideal if one may just want one bulb in one room, like your teenager's room or in your bathroom.\nI hope this helps, this was only clear to me after consulting the chart distinguishing the differences between the various bulbs.\n\nI use I Heart Radio and Sirius XM radio apps to play my favorite jams. This is going to make life better.\n\nOne last thing: while I was playing music, my husband happened to turn the TV on in the same room. He used a WiFi remote, and the music quality got grainy. But, when we aren't using them simultaneously, it's not an issue.\n\nReally awesome product!"},{"reviewerName":"R. Cutler","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great idea","reviewDate":"July 6, 2019","reviewText":"These were very easy to set up and have surprisingly good sound quality. I set up a series of them on my porch for outdoor parties. They have good volume and it's nice to be able to turn off the light portion during the day. Lights are plenty bright and do that job fine as well.\n\nBluetooth range isn't great relative to other bluetooth devices I own, but not enough to drop a star. Range is probably limited by how/where the device is mounted.\n\nThe app is straightforward, but sometimes takes a few tries to find the master bulb and can be annoying.\n\nI received one satellite unit with a sound quality issue, but Amazon customer service was great as usual and it was replaced at no charge.\n\nThis is a great way to add wireless speakers without extra holes and wiring. Clever idea. I'm planning an indoor setup at some point when I can swap out my dimmer switch (these can't be installed on a dimmer)."},{"reviewerName":"seeker mom","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"This product came with 2 bulbs and easy instructions.

Alba","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Easy to install and use- Cool product.","reviewDate":"January 3, 2016","reviewText":"To start, I will tell you that I didn't expect fantastic stereo sound with thumping bass from these speakers- I think that would be unrealistic.\nInstallation was very, very easy. I may have to turn in my \"man card\" but I actually read the instructions and they were pretty simple. Install the \"Master\" bulb like any other bulb and (I have an iPhone) go to your Bluetooth settings and search for new devices- the bulb popped right up and I paired with it. This brought up a pop up screen letting me know I needed an app to use the lights so I clicked on the provided link, installed the app and I was on my way. The app is extremely easy to use as you can dim the lights, turn them on and off and even control each light individually. The music is easy too, just turn the volume up to whatever you desire, go to your iTunes and hit play on whatever you want to hear.\nThe speakers are fine for background music if you are having a party and you can crank it up a bit, but as I said, you are not going to rock your house with these bulb speakers, but they are not bad at all. Negatives: There is a slight buzzing sound from the Master speaker that, if you focus on it will drive you nuts. I originally tried to ignore the directions and installed the bulbs with a dimmer on my switch- big mistake as the buzzing was pretty loud and if it hadn't decreased after removing the dimmer, I would have returned these bulbs but it got much better. Second negative: you have to go to your Bluetooth settings and re-establish the connection every time you leave the room and come back in as once you lose your connection by leaving or turning the wall switch off. Also, i'd like for more than one phone to be able to operate the lights at one time....but maybe that would start a fight in my house! All in all, a very cool product that is really easy to install and use. I got so excited after installing them that I ordered two more \"Satellite\" bulbs and now have all the bulbs in my family room set up- the kids get a kick out of it. My gadget-phobe wife is not so excited...she preferred the dimmer switch on the wall. My daughter wants these in her room...guess I know what she is getting for her birthday."},{"reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Overall a great purchase.","reviewDate":"December 20, 2016","reviewText":"The lights are great and have speakers have a pretty good sound. Does not sound as good as most Bose products but taking into consideration that these are LIGHT BULBS they sound great. Those who primarily play club type music which requires a lot more bass will probably want to buy the subwoofer. I listen primarily to rock type music and these deliver all of the bass I really need. Set up couldn't be easier. My phone automatically connects to them when I walk into the house. The lights come on with the switch regardless of being connected to Bluetooth. When you have music playing and a phone call comes in it automatically pauses your music and WILL NOT play your phone call over the speakers. Music resumes as soon as you hang up the phone.

The brightest setting offers plenty of light & during the day we just turn the brightness down all of the way. It is now August 2018 and the app rarely ever picks the bulbs up.

Decently heavy.","reviewDate":"March 30, 2018","reviewText":"I had recently purchased so Sengled bulbs which used a wifi connection. I did not realize that these only connect via bluetooth and need the pulse app not the element home app. As with any bluetooth device you have to determine range in your home. I wish there was a bluetooth extender for these. You can not control the level of audio for the individual speakers only on and off. You can control individual light levels. I also suggest turning the lights down while enjoying your music. They get rather warm at 100 percent which I imagine shortens the devices service life. You can not schedule these like their wifi cousins to turn the lights on and off. The acoustic obviously also depend on placement and what type of fixture you place them in. There are some good adjustments in the audio settings such as designating the speaker right ,left, or both and some basic frequency settings such as classical, jazz, rock, movie, pop, and normal. Please also note that these are decently heavy and will likely topple unsupstantial desk lamps or if used on the side of a skinny floor lamp. I haven't had these long so only giving 3 stars for now."},{"reviewerName":"lyle weiman","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Modifying my earlier review. Good sound. Easy to set up for listening to music while I work.","reviewDate":"February 28, 2019","reviewText":"I checked and the two deliver left and right stereo sound, just as I wanted, over the Bluetooth connection. Or rather they did the first time I tried it. Then I moved them to ceiling light fixtures, _not_ on a dimmer. Now only one of them is controlled by the app. Both turn on but I can only get sound and only control brightness from one of them. The other, no sound, full brightness, does not lower when I lower brightness via the app, which the first one does. It's as if somehow the bluetooth code gets confused over whether to connect to the master or the slave. I spent ten minutes fooling with it, un-pairing, turning power on and off to the speaker/lights, rebooting the phone, re-discovering via bluetooth, nothing changes. Still only one of them controlled by the Android phone app, other one: no sound, full brightness. I don't know how but somehow the master lost the address of the satellite. I was able to re-establish using the app and the barcode reader facility and now both speakers and light level controls for both work together.

As time and technology has advanced the prices for older models have decreased. And that is the very reason these are a great buy. Are you going to get room filling sound that sounds like a stereo system? No\nWill they light up your bedroom to replace your 100W or equivalent bulbs? No\nWhat they are great for are setting the mood or ambiance over the kitchen island as you cook or above the bar counter in your home to sorta create your own bubble to enjoy with your partner. The sound quality is in line with a JBL Flip 3. It has bass but not overwhelming. The stereo separation depends on the distance between the satellite and master. In the kitchen they are roughly 6ft apart and over the bar counter, about 3 ft. The kitchen stereo separation is more noticeable but I actually prefer sitting under them at the bar counter.\n\nThe price is great, sound quality is good for the price, the convenience of not having to charge the lights is awesome, and the only real negative for these I can come up with is the app. The app has been neglected for some time now and it shows. From lagging to connect to change settings to not utilizing the entire scree on my Xs Max, the app shows the age of the product.

A 10 minute hookup tops and we were in business with the third receptacle holding the Wi-Fi boost light.

Specifically any master and satellites would need to be in the same room inside about 15 feet to function properly. This makes the idea of one master and 7 satellite speakers just silly since no surround sound methods are supported and every bulb would need to be inside the same smallish room. The sound is good and a home theater rig in overhead cans or lamps would deliver decent stereo along with dimmable lights, but the lights themselves do not support any colors other than a warm soft white lighting which doesn't match my cool daylight themed home at all. Installation for the pre-linked pair is as simple as connecting a bluetooth device to it. Other satellite speakers can be added by downloading the app and linking from there. The app can control volume and brightness for each individual speaker/light. Overall, it's a solid idea, but using something like powerline or WiFi to interconnect these units for multi-room sound would work way better."},{"reviewerName":"ToolFool","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Poor design, poor sound quality.

What a neat idea and for the most part very good implementation. The speaker is impressively clear and loud. I will say the bass is somewhat lacking but what can you expect from such a small speaker?!\n\nFirst...why I gave this only 3 stars - The bulbs I received have different shades of light. They are right next to each other and one is noticeably whiter than the other one is. This is disappointing and somewhat annoying as they really need to be the same color light. The second reason I gave this 3 stars is because the first set I received had one bulb with damaged threads and I couldn't screw it into the socket. My iPhone pairs right away every time but my wifes Galaxy S7 often struggles to pair.\n\nWhy I'd like to give this 5 stars - These bulbs have about a 65w equivalent light and they have speakers in them! The bluetooth works well on my iPhone. You can download an app to further control volume and dimming functionality but the app is not necessary if you just want to play music, you can use the volume buttons on your phone to adjust the speaker volume. The app also allows you to turn the lights off while still playing music and you can assign a speaker as the Left or Right speaker or have them both play stereo. This light fit nicely into a 6\" recessed can. The second set came with socket extensions and plastic thread protectors for shipping...maybe I wasn't the first to get a bulb with a bad thread.\n\nI am truly impressed by the speaker, the app, and the idea but...a light bulbs first job must be to provide light and this product just missed the mark on that since the bulbs aren't the same color light.\n\nI would really like to see this product line expanded into brighter LEDs.

Last week I put them in a fixture.\nFirst off, if your looking for a bulb that is aesthetically pleasing to the eye, don’t buy this. It’s just not pretty to look at but would be great in a garage or man cave. They’re very loud, the sound is great for the size of the speaker. The down fall is that there’s a delay in the sound from the main to the satellite. It’s not a big delay, but it’s definitely noticeable. Maybe if I had the speakers in different rooms it wouldn’t be as pertinent.. another downside is the Pulse app you need to download to use the functions of the light. It’s very slow to connect to the speakers and every time you exit the app to do anything on your phone, it needs to search for the lights again to connect and it takes a while. Not bad if you just need to leave a playlist on for a while but if you need to use them a lot like normal bulbs it can definitely be a nuisance. 1 star based on my personal experience."},{"reviewerName":"AL","rating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"A little archaic","reviewDate":"April 8, 2019","reviewText":"The biggest disapointment was the light cannot be controlled by my existing hub nor by the echo device.

I have four of these in two rooms in my house. The sound is only ok, I have a TDK speaker that I take around with me that has much better sound and a greater range. But I'm always losing the charger for it, so I though these would be great to have in various places in my house. Unfortunately they don't have the volume to replace my TDK speaker. While it's true that I could use more of the Senglet units together to make it louder, that would require purchasing more per room than just carrying my portable speaker with me. Also two of the receptacles I placed these bulbs in block all Bluetooth signal. What's the point of having these if they can't receive the signal. Also they are supposed to remember the last light level you had them at but frequently they don't and therefore go back to 100% brightness. I place one in my bathroom and set the brightness quite low, in the hopes that middle of the night bathroom visits would not blind me. No such luck, the unit is always resetting to full brightness. Such a pain. The sycronization between units is also a pain, if the other units are not on when the master unit is started then you can't add them to the group, they have to be on first.

You must change out the dimmer switch to a convention switch.\n\nSounds nasally."},{"reviewerName":"larry j elder","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Bulb didnt work and return was difficult and a waste of time","reviewDate":"August 30, 2019","reviewText":"I already had one set of these and i liked them so I bought a second set. The satelite bulb stoppes working within the first 48 hours of use. I contacted amazon (of whi h i but quite a lot of things from) and was treated like an utter dolt. They wanted to run me through a set by step trouble shooting process ( ive been in manufacturing,maintenance, and repair for about two decades) and when i explained that i had thourghly trouble shot the product they refused to except that i was capable of doing so. Finally they wanted to put me in contact with the manufacture; which they did. The manufacture wanted to run me through the same process to which i refused, eventually they sent me an email telling me to take pictures and give a written explanation of the problem. I did not do that because I'm done wasting my time (other than this review). I no longer want a replacement so good job. Ill just take the loss and buy a similar product from another manufacture. I really wanted the speaker to be wifi anyhow but this company has definitely lost my business (im sure they don't care anyhow)."},{"reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"doesn't always link to app","reviewDate":"May 8, 2019","reviewText":"over all this product does work well. The biggest downside is you need a phone to use them and if the lights wont link to the app on the phone then they are just regular bulbs. I installed theses in my living room can lights and run my Roku through them for surround sound. You do not need to buy anything special to link the TV audio to the light if you have a ROKU device and the Roku app on your phone. You can set the ROKU app to private listen which will then stream to your phone and then to the lights. Some times the sound doesn't sync perfectly fraction of a second really but beats spending tons of $$$ to do the same thing otherwise"},{"reviewerName":"ed","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"🎵 Works Great! 🎶","reviewDate":"October 7, 2019","reviewText":"Works awesome for the money and super easy to connect and no issues so far.

Since I was updating the bedroom, I thought it would be fun to add some technological flair with a light and speaker combo. See pictures below.\n\nI was excited about this genius new idea to combine lights AND speakers in one item. However, upon installing the lights, I was genuinely disappointed.\n\nLet me first say that the lights are in fact incredibly easy to install. You literally screw them in to light sockets. They are rather large, but I had anticipated that, and purchased gas light shades that would hide the bulbs. They do NOT work on dimmer switches, and I knew that beforehand. They produce a nice, incandescent-quality light with a fairly smooth dimming range. The sound quality is mediocre and tinny, and I was hoping for much more based on reviews I had read.\n\nHere are my peeves with this item:\n\nIn order to connect to the lights/speakers, you must go in to settings > bluetooth and connect to the device EVERY time you leave range. It does not automatically reconnect after leaving range. That is just to use the speakers.\nTo control the lights, you download the Pulse app. Ok, no big deal. But if I want to turn on the lights, I have to go to settings > bluetooth, connect to the lights. Then I have to open the Pulse app (I usually wait 10 or so seconds before opening it, because I find if I open the app immediately after connecting to bluetooth, I end up waiting indefinitely), and then the Pulse app needs to do its own connection to the lights. From there, you can control the lights. Turning on the lights generally takes ~35 seconds (I timed it). To me, this is completely impractical as a primary light source in any space.\n\nOnly one device can be connected to the lights/speakers at any time, so if my husband wants to turn out his light while we're in bed, it can only be done on my phone.\n\nThere is a no Apple Watch compatibility as of yet.\n\nI haven't found any other apps that work specifically with these lights/speakers. For instance, I have a sleep app that can work with Phillips HUE lights to gradually turn on the lights to wake you up.\n\nIn essence, this is a mixed review. These lights are not good as a primary dimmable light source (unless you have something like a spare iPod to be used as a dedicated dimmer switch). They might serve some purpose in a living room with no surround sound system where you want to add some dimmable spotlights in an area."},{"reviewerName":"Christina R.","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"just wow! wireless surroundsound","reviewDate":"January 31, 2019","reviewText":"I tried three different Bluetooth speakers from different companies, and this one was so good I bought three sets.

Lewis","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Nothing like this on the market, really great!","reviewDate":"June 8, 2015","reviewText":"Great! I bought this set (master + satellite), and then another pair of satellites to expand the system. I don't think it's necessarily expensive, since it's hard to compare - there's really nothing quite like it on the market. Unlike many music speaker/LED lightbulb combinations, these link, meaning one phone can play the same song to up to 8 of these.\n\nThere's a simple to use iPhone App. There's also an Android version, although I didn't try that myself. The app lets you connect to the bulbs. Pairing is easy... the master shows up as a Bluetooth device, so you pair to it from your phone's settings menu just like you would a headset, a bluetooth portable speaker, or your car. From there, the app takes over, and you can add extra satellite lights either by entering in the code from the bulb, or scanning a QR-code with your phone's camera to automate the process without typing - time saver!\n\nThe app let's you control a cluster of up to 8 lights. You can turn them on and off, or control dimming from \"0-100%\" (it's really more like 0-10 since the increments aren't very smooth). You can also control the volume of the speakers. From the app, you can control ALL lights at once, or bulbs individually (so dim all bulbs, or dim bulb #2 for example). Each bulb can be labeled for ease of use, i.e.: \"Family Room Front Right\".\n\nIn addition, each bulb is stereo, but can be assigned to play stereo, or just the left channel or right channel. If you have the right room layout, the stereo effect is greatly enhanced if you set a bulb to be just right and another to be just left.\n\nNow for the cons... although I just took away one star, because frankly, this is an emerging market, and all products are new.\n\n1) I wish you could group lights by room. So rather than control ALL lights, or ONE light, I could control the \"Family Room\". I may eventually buy another master speaker and just split up the bulbs, but it'd be nice if you could just do this from the app.\n\n2) I wish it was compatible with something else... anything else. Zigbee... Insteon... WeMo... Hue... anything. We have Iris by Lowe's for security, since we got a pretty good deal on the kit. We also have a thermostat for the Iris, so one app controls alarm and temperature. I'd like to add lights to the system... and while Iris isn't compatible with tons of bulbs, Pulse is compatible with nothing else. So if I added regular bulbs, I might end up with THREE apps to control things. Some more vendor interoperability here would be nice. Or Pulse could keep going their own way... but they need to come out with plain LED bulbs that control themselves from the same app... but don't have a speaker and a $80 price tag.\n\n3) These are BIG. In a table lamp, it'd be fine, since it's all concealed behind the lamp shade. In our ceiling, they hang down a quarter inch past our recessed opening, whereas a normal flood bulb sits flush.\n\nBut... if you've read this far.. here's the big PLUS...\n\nNothing sounds this good! The quality of music coming out of our ceiling is pretty darn good. Granted, I don't have a ton to compare it against... but it sounds better than the overhead music in department stores. It sounds about as good as my older Jawbone bluetooth speaker, but not quite as good as my father's Bose bluetooth speaker. It's a solid performer, and if you have enough (our family room has 4 overhead lights, and we have Pulse in all 4 of them and the room just sounds great.\n\nI'm not an audiophile, but the best way I can sum it up is, while it's not a high end home theater sound, it's good enough that I can tell the difference between the low resolution free Pandora audio vs a higher bit rate MP3 from my iTunes collection. So there is some real fidelity there."},{"reviewerName":"SpaceManSpiff","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Poor sound","reviewDate":"April 16, 2019","reviewText":"Sounds tinny.

The LED lights are nice and bright and dim nicely. The only thing I wish was better is some times it is buggy to connect to the Bluetooth, it will say your connected but you still need to go into settings and press connect anyways, but that's kind of the nature of Bluetooth isn't it? It's not perfect! The other thing I wish is when you turn on the light switch the volume in the app is defaulted to 80%, I wish there was an option to change the defaults to whatever you want. But those are just software things that they will probably improve with updates.

I want more people to buy them so they'll keep making them and the price will come down and every light in my house will be one of these. This is a genius idea, with a very good implementation on the speaker side. In fact, on the speaker side, I give these a 5 for sound. Add Sonos integration and then you have 5 across the board on speakers. As pure lights, they're also a 5 -- no start up delay, nice color temperature. But at this price point, I want more than just light, I'd like Hue-type color change, synced to the music. Then, I'd give this a full on 5.\n\nAs I said above, the sound is pretty darn good. Not going to be very bassy, but it has good volume, good sound even at low volume, and all in all good sound. People are blown away when they realize the music is not coming from some hidden speaker in the ceiling, but from the light bulb.\n\nAlso, incredibly easy to set up and use.

Be sure to get the wireless subwoofer receiver if need more bass. (I'll be review that as well) Its quick and east to set up, and can be expanded to 7 or 8 lights total. One downside, the physical size of the lights themselves. They are big! I get the idea that they are supposed to fit in a canister light mount, but it would be awesome if they could fit in a normal lamp with a normal lamp shade harp.\n\nThe Sengled app is very easy to use.

I like that they provide the little adapters in case your socket spacing is too close. The app for pairing is a bit flaky but I assume this is more a limitation of Bluetooth than the app itself.

Currently, I have an Amazon Echo that I love but I would like to hear it through my house. Sonos has a wireless speaker system that looks like it would do the trick but for $200-$500 per speaker it is more than I’m willing to spend. Putting a few light bulbs that double as speaker looks the best and simplest idea ever. Note, you have to have an “Echo Dot” to connect Bluetooth speakers—the original and tap do not allow Bluetooth speaker.\n\nPros:\n1. Simple to install.\n2. Nice application for changing light and speaker volume.\n3. The only multi bulb speaker on the market so far in May 2016. Don’t be fooled by the other light bulbs that claim multiple bulbs can be put in “Bluetooth groups”. Yes, other bulbs can be put in “Bluetooth groups” but sound will only come out from one light bulb at a time. It is a hard limitation of the current Bluetooth design.\n\nAcceptable:\nThe sound quality is okay but face it: it is a speaker inside of a light bulb. You can buy a subwoofer for the system if you require better sound fidelity.\n\nCons:\n1. The distance for wireless is less than 30 feet. 30 feet might be acceptable for an apartment but it is far too small for a house. My plan was for speakers in the kitchen, shower, master bedroom, and living room. The closest two rooms were my kitchen and bathroom. The light sockets were 27 feet apart which was too far for the wireless speaker. :( Why couldn’t they use my current house WiFi to transmit the sound?\n2. You can only connect one device at a time to the speakers. This is an issue because I connected it to my Amazon Echo. Once connected to my Echo I could not connect my android device to change the volume or light intensity.\n3. They are not compatible with Amazon Echo voice commands. For example you cannot use echo to control the light intensity. Sengled is designing their own “Voice” light bulb so I doubt the will spend any effort on making these compatible with Echo.\n4. As far as I can tell there is only a master volume and light intensity control. You cannot have some lights on and others dimmed or off.\n\nSuggestions:\nThis is the coolest concept I’ve seen this year. If it used a better wireless connection that could cover my whole house, and allowed a phone app to connect while it was playing music on another device I would have keep them regardless of the sound quality. If they added a microphone and made the bulb Amazon Echo compatible it would be the greatest item ever. Imagine being able to give Echo commands anywhere in your house. It could even be smart enough to play the answer on the light bulb that heard the question, or turn on any lights that heard “Alexa lights.”"},{"reviewerName":"adh","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Very good.

I picked up a regular replacement light switch at the local hardware store and the humming sound went away and no more choppy music. Everything works great!\n\nThe sound is excellent for background music during a party or get together. If you are looking for the speakers to replace your home entertainment system then you may be disappointed.

I may try pairing them with a subwoofer at some point to balance out the sound.\n\nOn the down side, the bulbs do not come on immediately with the other lights; there is a 2 second or so delay.

One of the coolest procedure I've ever seen and the sound quality is similar to a good sound system in a car.

Sounds and lights are just as expected. They didn't fit in either of the recessed lighting areas I anticipated placing them so I had to put them elsewhere but they work well in the alternate location. The issue I have is that once Bluetooth is disconnected (out of range), you have to reconnect it each time to operate the light. Usually a device reconnects automatically when in range of the Bluetooth. This makes for a frustrating experience when trying to turn on the light when you get home only to spend the next moments establishing the bloothtooth connection.

The concept is great, but the sound quality is dreadful Honestly, if I strapped a couple of alarm clock radios to the ceiling I think they'd sound about the same as these Sengled speakers. I was really surprised about the poor audio quality given that the drivers are supplied by JBL but, in fairness, the drivers are very small and therefore, realistically incapable of producing high quality, room filling, sound.\n\nI spoke with Sengled customer service and they confirmed that a WiFi version is currently available in Europe, but not the US. Perhaps the WiFi connectivity (which is used by higher-end units like Sonos) may result in better quality than the Bluetooth transmission these units employ.\n\nThe corresponding app was simple to use and set-up was very easy using the QR code scan feature built into the app.\n\nLighting control through the app was also good, with reliable and quick on/off and very responsive dimming capability. One important aspect to note - the light temperature is 2700K, which puts these units at the very low end of the soft white range and makes them noticeably contrasting to the more common soft level of around 3000K. I'd recommend checking the color temperature of any existing can lights you'd want to match, as these will look strange if placed in a group that's not very closely similar to 2700K.\n\nBottom line - lights and speakers, in an inexpensive configuration like this ($99 for the pair), probably just aren't going to impress too many people if reasonably high-end audio is expected. Praise to Sengled for trying, but oops for the result."},{"reviewerName":"zhengziying","rating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"the buzzing sound is unbearable","reviewDate":"December 5, 2014","reviewText":"I read the review by the other buyer \"nokia6230\" before I placed the order.

I found the buzzing sound is very annoying to my ears when there is no music or low volume. Also because I installed mine in the bathroom: the ceiling is low, room is small and we usually play light music in bathroom.\n\nBuzzing sound aside, the units itself looks good build quality and the sound quality is good: quite rich and good depth.

Yeah that's the difference between these speakers in a can and a Bose. These are strait up junk. It hurts my ears to turn them on. They are muffled and resonate only the highs. There is no bass at all and only the snare drum can be heard. Okay so I'm not only going to pick on the sound quality. The app...lol oh the app is trash. Everytime I go in it shuts down. When it does fire up, it has to search for the bulbs again. Only one device at a time can control the lights and the sound. So I linked then to my phone and my kitchen tab.

If you're not expecting superb sound quality, these would do the job. The iPad's speakers gave better sound than these at eye level but I suspect it's because the iPad was right infront of me.\n\nAny light music (classical, light jazz) would be no good for them, either. The pauses in light music exacerbated the buzzing sound of the speakers. Rock, Rap, Alt music was no problem, though. Even talk radio came in crisp and bright.\n\nThe LED light was just as bright, if not brighter, than the bulbs that I replaced.\n\nIf the dimmer switch is not the one that it requires, it would start pulsing the light on/ off and not work properly. Which leads me to why it's only two stars for me.. The dimmer can only be controlled by the iOs app. An iOs app that needs to be 7.0 or above. I mean, really? No backwards compatibility for lower iOs's? So what happens when they upgrade the iOs a couple of years down the road? That would render this thing useless when the app becomes obsolete.\n\nSure, you can still control the sound and light (on/ off) via the manual controls but if you were thinking of using this with the iOs app, you'd have to budget for a newer phone every couple of years. Not sure how this would pertain to the Android app.\n\nAlso, I would need to update this later but I don't think the unit has a memory function. So if I set the dimmer switch on the wall at max power and controlled the light via the iOS app to 50% light, it would not remember that once the unit was turned off.\n\nIt would be nice to have it at a set volume and light level everytime you turned it on.\n\nUPDATE:\nSo the iOs app controls the dimmer, volume (set which is left, right, or stereo for both, or just turn either off), and the equalizer.

We'd hoped to use these to play our Blue Tooth enabled Satellite Radio. We currently use wireless speakers.\nThey do work but have annoying features. The units are so long they extend flush with the ceiling in a standard contractors Can light. The LED bulbs are Very bright so that these units are almost blinding anywhere in the room or hallway unless you turn them below 25%. We currently use 11w, 56 SMD 5730 LED flood light bulbs in these Can fixtures. But they're 1/3 to 1/4 as long as these Sengled Pulse units so the 11w floods provide nice light without blinding you unless you're directly under them and look up. The LEDs in the Sengled Pulse are built right next to the bottom of the unit so you're looking directly at the LEDS from anywhere in the room or hallway. Very Bright to the point of being blinding.\nThe Satellite units don't work well if it's more than about 12 ft. from the Master unit. Total dropout after 20 ft. separation.\nWe are unable to get either Master Unit to 'pair' with my wife's iPhone 6 Plus and yes we downloaded the iPhone App. Her iPhone works fine with our other wireless speakers and other Bluetooth devices, just not these.\nWhenever you turn them on, they come on at 100% brightness and volume. So when you turn them on you have to adjust the brightness and volume again - every time you turn them on.\nBottom-line, these are too annoying for us to use. We packed them up and will donated them to Goodwill.\nIf I hadn't bought them on a Lightening deal for 50% off, I'd be going to the trouble of returning them."},{"reviewerName":"Ed C","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Good value for pair!","reviewDate":"June 14, 2019","reviewText":"4 Star because I knew what I was getting, and because of VALUE FOR $30 for PAIR!\n\nLet me start by saying I knew what I was getting when I ordered these, and thats a good thing because if you have never heard these before you could wind up disappointed. Speaker wise, these lack a low end and any bass at all so be prepared for that. If you like ‘smart home’ stuff and like the idea that there would be no obvious speaker but something hidden(like me) these are right up your alley just be prepared for no low end/bass as far as sound.\n\nAt $30 for the pair(what they now cost) these bulbs really are great. I couldnt imagine paying retail when they were once $100 or more. The sound can get quite loud when multiple bulbs are paired and in use(I have two currently set up for stereo). The stereo effect sounds good, the mids and highs sound good but there is no low end or bass. the sound is clear, and the volume can really get loud. The brightness of the light does lack a bit, but its not bad and the ability to dim on a switch I dont normally have a dimmer is nice. The application could use some streamlining and updates to become more user friendly and faster but its ok and gets the job done with a little patience.\n\nThe bulbs themselves are an easy install like any other bulb. Make sure to plug in and pair the master before you plug in or power on the satellite. Definitely would recommend to someone who just wants to easily put sound somewhere as a cheap invisible option where they wouldnt otherwise be able to get it as long as they understand exactly what theyre getting.\n\nOverall, i think sengled should stick with JBL as their speaker supplier, I stayed away from their newer model not only because of cost but because they arent JBL. I think the app needs some big updates, and any future generations of these bulbs should include both bluetooth and wifi options. Wifi would make for better sound quality, reliability, and app usage. Also, i think an outdoor option would be nice, although if you have covered lights outside these would likely be fine, but if theyre recessed be prepared for that to impact the sound some."},{"reviewerName":"Lace Wawers","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Eh, has its positives and negatives","reviewDate":"April 4, 2019","reviewText":"Wanted this to put in my bathroom for a speaker.

So what you have playing on one, also plays on the other. You also can't have different volumes on each of them either, whatever is on one is on the other as well. I also couldn't figure out how to connect the Alexa option. The whole reason I wanted it in my bathroom was so I could just tell Alexa to play something for me while showering/bathing. That way I didn't have to pull out my phone and risk water damage. Basically just a HUGE let down on what I wanted. I wound up putting the parent in my bedroom and just connect via Bluetooth, the other light bulb just sits in the box. Not completely a waste of money, but definitely not worth the $80.

And in Windows 10 you can go to Sound Settings (R. click on speaker icon in system tray) and hit App features (down the bottom) and make different media players use different audio devices (make sure you launch the ones you want first), so you can play more than one file at the same time, which is neat. But with no external audio control or external dimming feature then this audio light bulb is not very practical for that.

If that is your use case you should get these and try them out.\n\nThat being said...\n1: Make sure you know your final design before you buy anything. Unfortunately Sengled plays this game where you are forced into this silly product funnel where you can't just buy the parts you need but have to buy them in multi unit kits.\n\nExample: You buy the pair of Sengled Pulse bulbs and like them and now want to use them for your TV sound system. You can't just buy the unit that connects to your TV, you have to buy *another* pair of bulbs that also comes with the TV adapter.\n\nI absolutely cannot stand product management that forces customers to second guess their initial purchase when trying to upgrade. It makes no sense. Just sell the TV adapter on its own, the same as the subwoofer adapter (which looks identical to the TV adapter btw, very confusing) is available by itself.\n\n2: Annoying high pitch whine comes from one of my bulbs. Changing the dimmer setting on the bulbs in the Sengled app changes the volume and possibly frequency of the whine. I've noticed the lowest whine volume at app 34% and 69%, which leads me to believe this is some harmonic issue probably related to the 60Hz AC utility frequency most of us in North America get from our wall outlets.\n\nIt's not one of those things I can pretend I don't hear as the bulb is two feet from my ear hole. I don't remember this noise the day I initially set up the Sengled bulbs, but did notice by day three. Not sure if it developed over time or if I just hadn't noticed yet, but now I can't un-notice.\n\n3: You absolutely need the subwoofer bridge unit and a powered subwoofer unless all you intend to listen to is classical music."},{"reviewerName":"Kent M","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Only for certain situations","reviewDate":"March 13, 2018","reviewText":"Wanted these for a while, received a coupon so decided to pick them up.

I did not want speakers which had to be wired in or bulky rechargeable blue-tooth speakers. I found these and figured with JBL speakers, these should be OK. They have exceeded my expectations. Mind you they will not replace my Cerwin-Vega E315's for inside, but for wonderful yard filling music (quite loud for their size), TV sound, or streaming radio, they are worth more than the price I paid. There is not much bass but the app has a pre-programmed EQ which evens out the sound very acceptably. Remember these are not $500 speakers.\n\nThe lighting was my only real concern as they appear to only cast the light straight down, this is not the case. With only two bulbs, there is more than enough light for the 30' x 15' porch. We usually have the light set at 50% which is nice for relaxing comfort but still plenty to read or commiserate by. At 100% there is plenty of light to have company and play cards or eat dinner. Also after turning off the lights at our inside wall switch, when turning them back on, the lights come back on at the last setting.\n\nThe app is also very easy to use. The ability to make each bulb a right side or left side speaker or make each or just one a mono speaker is great when listening to Oldies which were recorded in Hi-Fi stereo. you can even mute just on or the other or both if you need to. All of my audio apps work great with them. If you are on the fence about whether of not to add these to you home, you won't be sorry you did, and your friends will be jealous!\n\nOne downside, the bulbs only have the one color, Warm White.

After a quick email to the company, I received a rapid reply to return the product to them so they could inspect and send back a new set to me. It turns out I needed to use an inexpensive, extension piece from Home Depot/Lowes/etc so that the unit could actually come in contact with the inside of the light (this is apparently a relatively common occurrence and if you have a problem with it not working, I suggest starting there). A minor annoyance, but it turned out fine. More important to me, I received an unprompted phone call from Alex at the company to walk through the issue and help me problem solve it after I had sent in the lights. To me, that is rare and outstanding customer service. He held me on the line while he consulted a colleague and was able to determine that I need the extension. So now, they work fantastic and the ability to quickly set up a \"whole house\" audio is achievable. Don't expect it to sound like a superior stereo system, it is missing a bit of bass, but it isn't any worse than my sound bar with bluetooth. Moreover, I can use my phone to control the volume on a room by room basis, really cool stuff. So, overall, I think this is a great product to put background music into each of your rooms on a relatively cheap basis without tearing out wall/ceiling etc for wiring. I will definitely be buying more satellites. If you do buy this product and need help, call their office in Alpharetta GA and ask fro Alex (but first try the extension trick).

Yes they are. So why four stars you ask? While they are cool, they could be improved so they aren't 5 star yet.\n\nFirst off these work well.\n\nThe light part works as expected. Just to be clear, these are designed to replace flood/spot lights normally found in cams on the ceiling. While they may work in other places such as bedside lamps (stereo coolness!) they are large enough that many lamps won't support their size AND the LED light is designed to work like most LED bulbs do which means light comes out one direction only. So if you install these in your lamp, expect no light in the shade but instead all light goes straight up at the ceiling.\n\nThe speakers are decent for the size. You need to compare these more against normal in-ceiling speakers (which don't sound so wonderful) than other bluetooth speakers or higher end speakers. I would say the speakers sound like $15-$20 speakers (each) which is about what you expect. I would love to be impressed with the audio quality but instead it was about as expected with a tinniness and a \"small\" sound lacking bass. For the price of these, I was hoping for a bit better to be honest.\n\nThe app is simple and works well. I do not have any complaints. Other similar (but cheaper) products include an actual remote control which could be useful in some situations. These are only controlled via the app.\n\nWhat could be improved?\n\nI wish the light output was brighter, esp since it is supposed to replace flood lights.\nI wish there was a normal bulb replacement designed with all around light output to use in table lamps.\nI wish they were waterproof/designed for outside use. Given the price point, being weather resistant would help justify the cost.\nI wish these had better bass and overall sound.

Light and sound are controlled directly from the application, including the ability to adjust light dimming and sound volume, audio equalizer modes, and launch your favorite media players such as Pandora, Spotify and others directly from the Pulse mobile app. They are an innovative product. I'm curious to see how long they will last. I pair them with my ANDROID 2 smartphone without any problems. They are a bit pricey at $169 with Amazon Prime shipping and are not waterproof.

I mean there are other products out there but these are juts pretty cool\n\nSo let's talk about the physicality of the lights. They're big and they're heavy. Both of my lamps handed them fine but the front of the bulb just stick out just past the floor lamp. It's barely noticeable and my guest would not ever see it from the exact side that you would notice this on.\n\nNow the Pulse App worked pretty well. I could make the lights dimmer or brighter, raise and lower the sound without any problems at all. Although the App does allow you to connect to other DLNA devices, and it saw my desktop... that was not flawless. It took a very long time to load the music from the folders there and unlike my Sony BluRay home theater set-up, this app doesn't seem able to bring in my playlists so it just wanted shuffle through my entire library which I never do. The good news is, you can use any Application you want on your device to pay the music, you just need to run the Pulse App to do work the lights and could do the music as well. I used Amazon's Music playor to do this myself.\n\nSpeaking of Amazon. I couldn't find this app on the Amazon App store. I search online to see if anyone else had any luck with it. Without going into side-loading, I just didn't see a way to get it on my Amazon Fire tablet which would be preferrable, for me, over my smartphone. This is really unfortunate on Amazon's part.\n\nThe sound is not bad, not really on par with the Solemate or Altec Lansing iMW555-BLK. I have both of those. This isn't really a knock against the device so much admitting you're sacrificing in one area to gain that light functionality.\n\nNow for functionality, I really wish there was an alarm setting to the Pulse app. I mean having the lights pop and music blare would be great. This of course would be a nice feature to have but not a minus against the product as is. What is though are some assumptions made by the company in regard to the product. Now I believe they're estimating 3 hours a day, like a typical light in terms of getting maybe 22 years of use out of it... except this isn't a typical light is it. I might not leave lights on all day, but I would certainly listen to music for longer than hours at a time, easily. The other thing I am noticing is no real buttons on the device... which isn't really necessary right, except I don't see a way to reset the device. I am not talking about technology out pacing it in 22 years which is bound to happen but really, pairing devices. Bluetooth has a maximum, so if you can't unpair a device from the device itself, say your phone actually died, you're going to hit that max certainly within 22 years. Pulse could very well have a solution for this, but I have not found it readily available, yet.\n\nAnyway, this is cool. If you have someone that likes neat AND functional gadgets, this does work as advertised, and it's pretty good at it too."},{"reviewerName":"Dom Miliano","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Clever product - Fills a niche I didn't know existed","reviewDate":"June 28, 2014","reviewText":"I live on the west side of a steep hill - a hill that blocks FM signals coming from NYC. As a news junkie, I listen to NPR in the morning since so much happens over night that I want to (need to) know about. The reception is spotty and easily affected by rain, snow, and (I think) sun spots! Frustrating... I have WiFi in the house and lots of Bluetooth connected devices like my tablet, smart phone and MP3 player - each of which has web access and NYC radio broadcasts. We have spotlights in the master bath so I screwed these ingenious bulbs in, downloaded the App from the web and was listening to crystal clear FM broadcasts in 10 minutes. Wow!\n\nAnd, yes, you need the App. It lets you adjust volume, dim the lights (you are warned to NOT put the bulbs in a dimming socket) and even shut the lights off while maintaining the sound. Cool!\n\nThe sound quality is acceptable - better than the table radio that was in the bathroom but not really HiFi.\n\nOne star for the creativity.

Turned all the way up, they were just loud enough to be listened to over my running fan. The resulting sound was tinny at times.\nWhile you can install these virtually anywhere you would a standard light bulb, there is the issue of size. These are much larger in width than a standard light bulb & do not fit in all of my light fixtures.\nI am currently using them in pendulum style lighting in my office which is great for the surround sound effect when using both speakers, but the light is concentrated down. This means it does not spread light throughout the room like a regular bulb (the sides are blocked from projecting light as you can see in the pictures). Use of the app can take care of the light, but if you have the lights to also light your space this could be an issue.\nAside from these minor irritations, I'm pretty impressed with the ease of use & how well they blend right in creating sound out of \"thin air\"."},{"reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Don’t waste your time.....","reviewDate":"May 17, 2019","reviewText":"Terrible!

Now I have these speakers set up in the two areas that I most frequent so I can listen to streaming internet radio/music/audio books without that annoying cut out.\n\nI installed the bulbs/speakers by simply screwing them into two lamps. They are a bit large and they feel unusually heavy. Then I downloaded the free app. It's called Pulse by Sengled+, which might be helpful to know because I inadvertently downloaded something called Mobile Pulse when I first tried the set up.\n\nThe bluetooth paired and connected easily.\n\nI was impressed by the sound.

Linking up the bluetooth was easy,the app connects automatically once set up.

Great for waiting rooms so you can entertain people waiting without the expense of having it wired and mounting speakers, everyone will wonder where the music is coming from.

But for the price, it should deliver more/better. The Bluetooth connection startup is inconsistent- sometimes when you come into range, it links, other times, you have to manually connect with your device. There are only pre-set equalization choices, and the overall sound is rather flat. I'm comparing it to my Amazon Echo and my Pandora radio, not my stereo. Also, you can only turn the speakers on/off, not balance the audio levels individually. The light is a warm white as indicated, so it replaces an incandescent bulb as well or better than my other LEDs. There is a slight hum from the bulbs when music isn't playing- that's not acceptable.

Unfortunately, they haven't proven to be as convenient or versatile as I was hoping. Yes, they can screw into any E26 socket, but they are larger than a standard bulb and the ventilation in the bulb can't be blocked. So in reality, I'm finding very few places in my house these are compatible with. (And I say that as someone who lives in a condo that was gut rehabbed in 2004 and has a lot of built in lights.) My hope was to use these in the bathroom since outlets there are at a premium, but they were far too big to fit into my light fixture. I'm also not sure why the product description on this page says to use them on terraces, patios and balconies when the instructions that come with the lighting say they are only to be used indoors. Basically, I think the marketing is misleading when they say they can be used in any socket, because that is just not what I am finding from my own experience. My advice would be to take the dimensions and actually measure your intended space to make sure they will actually fit before ordering.\n\nThat said, when I finally found a socket where they fit, the experience was pretty good. The app is intuitive and doesn't seem buggy or slow. And the sound quality is pretty good. I also have a few other speaker systems in my house and I do think that my Bose SoundDock 10 Bluetooth Digital Music System,Bose® Acoustimass® 10 Series IV home entertainment speaker system - Black, and Sony HT-CT660 46-Inch Sound Bar with Wireless Subwoofer sound better. But I expected that based on the difference in price points and the presence of a subwoofer with my Bose Acoustimass and Sony HT-CT600 systems. These definitely don't have that level of richness or base. However, I do think they sound very good overall for what they are and the price point. If you are a hardcore audiophile these likely will disappoint you, but for the average listener I think they sound pretty good and we tried a range of music from R&B to folk rock to rap to rock. We haven't really been able to use the dimmer function as these only fit in my overhead can lights where they are two lights of many so dimming just two doesn't really make sense. It seems like you'd need to replace all the lights on a single switch to really have this feature make sense, which is a bummer because I do love being able to control my lights wirelessly. I have the Belkin WeMo Light Switch, Control Your Lights From Anywhere with the Home Automation App for Smartphones and Tablets, Wi-Fi Enabled installed on a different light and it is awesome.\n\nOverall, I think this is a cool idea and the sound quality you get is good for the price. I only wish the lights where smaller so they would be compatible with more light fixtures or that they would come out with different sizes because that would really increase the versatility, especially if you are a renter who plans to use them as you move from place to place."},{"reviewerName":"HarmorMS","rating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Humming noise","reviewDate":"May 14, 2018","reviewText":"I wanted to like these but if you are not playing music they just make a small faint humming noise that will drive you crazy when you notice it."},{"reviewerName":"Bill","rating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Not ready for primetime.

The only other requirement was that the speakers permit bluetooth connectivity.\n\nEnter the Pulse-JBL LED speakers. Our past experience with JBL has been good. They develop compact innovative solutions like the JBL OnBeat Air iPad/iPod/iPhone Speaker Dock with AirPlay and JBL On Stage 200ID High-Performance Speaker Dock for iPhone 4/4S and iPod (Black) series. They don't have the punch for a large room, but deliver great sound in a 15' x 12' bedroom.\n\nI replaced 2 of 4 recessed BR30 CFLs in our open kitchen layout with the Pulse-JBLs. The CFLs are about 2 years old and might have decreased in intensity, but the 8w/600 Lumens LEDs were keeping up in brightness with the 23W/1300 Lumen CFLs. Standing in the kitchen we did not notice any one side brighter than the other. Both lamps are 2700K in color and depending on the manufacturer it is listed as \"warm white\" or \"bright white\" - they both have a slight yellow tinge in them.\n\nThe speaker setup is simple. Switch on the bulbs, switch on the bluetooth on your device, pair with the speakers and play your music through them. The sound quality is good! It will not please your teenager and definitely not an audiophile, but it is perfect for our application. My wife loves listening to her music while working in the kitchen and these produce good enough sound for her to enjoy her music. They are not tinny sounding and being installed in a recessed fixture does bump up the bass. Also, being installed in the ceiling they sound much larger and provide greater coverage - which is not possible with any under-cabinet or counter-top system where the speakers are next to each other.\n\nThe LEDs are dimmable via your wall switch as well as through the free Pulse App available in your app store. The pulse app permits you to control light dimming, sound volume and provides 6 EQ settings. Your device's native EQ settings will also work. The app does a lot to be desired. Since my application does not require dimming the lights, I am using my device's native interface instead of the app for volume/sound control.\n\nFor those looking to install these in any other application (floor lamps, etc.), note that these are BR30 bulbs that provide light in one direction. If you put these in a floor lamp, it will only light up your ceiling.\n\nLastly, you cannot have multiple devices connected at the same time. You have to disconnect the connected device to add a new one or atleast the connected device has to be out-of-range (more than 25 ft)\n\nRecommended!\n\nPros:\n* Concealed speakers in a compact LED bulb add an invisible, wired solution to your home without any modifications\n* JBL Speakers provide good sound for casual listening - not tinny!\n* LED bulb is dimmable via a wall dimmer or the free app\n* Bluetooth permits you to stream any audio content from your device\n* 8W LED consumption is eco friendly and keeps your bills low\n\nCons:\n* Cannot connect multiple devices simultaneously and have each device override the other\n* Pricey\n* Would be a 5-Star product, had it got a better app, was a little cheaper (~$125) and/or had color LEDs."},{"reviewerName":"Brady","rating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Slighty confusing sound quality with nice dimming lights","reviewDate":"January 16, 2016","reviewText":"Purchased the pair from Costco.

The dimming feature is nice, and they can remember the previous dim setting.\n\nSound, its close to being really good. The app has an equalizer which helps some. They of course dont have much bass. There is a slight hum sound but with music playing you don't notice it. Vocals are kinda hollow, muffled, just a bit off, not quite sure how to describe. I just tried an audio book and the voice was kinda hard to understand, yet classical music sounds great if that helps?\n\nThey are soooo close to sounding really good, I bet after the next few app updates they will have the equalizer nailed down.

I'm trying to talk myself into liking them but the more I listen to them the worse they sound. The only genre that sounds good is Classical. Otherwise the vocals are lost and washed out unless you are running them at like 80% full volume, but for the price that's horrible and I know I don't want that high volume all the time. My IPhone's speaker is way more clear. The app also doesn't remember your last volume setting so one you turn on the Bluetooth you have to go adjust it again, AND the speakers don't automatically connect to bluetooth so yoy have to select them each time.

Make sure you have right fixtures before ordering though.\n\n(Also, think of the horrible, horrible pranks you could play with these...)"},{"reviewerName":"Ronald S Bleile","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Three months & done","reviewDate":"April 6, 2019","reviewText":"I really like the product.

I love playing music, but hate the crappy sound I get from my phone. I have these installed in my dining room right now so that when I'm cleaning, cooking, or folding laundry, I can hear my music! They work much better than I expected. The light is like natural daylight and I love it! The sound is incredible! Very easy to set up. I'd give it 6 stars if I could!"},{"reviewerName":"Dorothy Griffith","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"The best thing ever","reviewDate":"April 16, 2017","reviewText":"These are about the coolest thing in my new house.

They either don't fit at all in some downward facing light receptacles, or they extend beyond the end of the track lights. They are awfully bright as well.\n\nIf they were smaller, I would love them. But as things stand now. I'll probably use them in a limited way."},{"reviewerName":"Karen","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Works Good","reviewDate":"July 22, 2014","reviewText":"They work great and the sound quality is excellent unfortunately they are a little large for some fixtures.

They are very easy to use and work really well for parties."},{"reviewerName":"Queen of Reviews","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great Sound Quality, lighting and app.","reviewDate":"July 22, 2014","reviewText":"We love these bulbs and the sound quality from the JBL speakers is awesome. The app provides full control from adjust the lighting levels to the multiple equalizer settings for the speakers."},{"reviewerName":"B Smith","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Pitiful sound, VERY unreliable Bluetooth.","reviewDate":"December 6, 2015","reviewText":"These looked like an interesting approach to background music in our family room. There were only two problems.\n\nThe first became apparent immediately: the sound sucks. Terribly. You CAN find songs with limited frequency range that sound okay as background, but pick something with vocals (I tried Eagles music) and they're absolutely garbage.\n\nThe second issue is the deal breaker. After a couple weeks, the app does not see the devices and Bluetooth fails to connect from ANY of my devices.\n\nPerhaps a nice science project, but pure rubbish. I'll be returning these today."},{"reviewerName":"Bob","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Interesting LED light and speaker combo","reviewDate":"July 15, 2014","reviewText":"These JBL Bluetooth Speakers also have LED Lights which screw into any standard E26 socket. The wireless function is good for 30 feet, and are compatible with any Bluetooth enabled device. The speakers have 13 watts and are surround sound quality. I think these speakers would be a great option for parties and rooms used for entertaining guests."},{"reviewerName":"Dwayne Poore","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Very nice!","reviewDate":"November 9, 2018","reviewText":"Great price, good quality & good sound...perfect for my garage!!!"},{"reviewerName":"R.

Two things I love are lights and bluetooth speakers, so this seemed like a match made in Heaven. The speakers do sound good, however, I wasn't able to put the satellite speaker 1 room away without the sound cutting in and out. The lights put out an annoying high pitched buzzing sound that is more than I can overlook. I wanted these lights/speakers so that I could have my music playing throughout my house without buying an outrageously priced sound system. Unfortunately they can't be placed far enough apart to achieve this."},{"reviewerName":"AusE","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"AMENDED REVIEW - much improved replacements!!","reviewDate":"June 28, 2014","reviewText":"My original order arrived with one bulb/speaker not working (the satellite) and this was frustrating. After some back and forth and a couple of issues with customer service, they agreed to promptly replace and once that was determined, they arrived the next day. I was able to ship back the original pair without issue (on their dime) and they concurred they were faulty. This new pair is great! The master bulb paired quickly with the bluetooth on my iPad and iPhone and I also downloaded the \"Pulse\" software, which was easy (and free). The equalizers are basic and probably not worth messing with much. The sound quality is good. I have the master installed in my kitchen light fixture (the bulb is bulky but firm) and the satellite in an adjoining hallway. Great to have surround sound as you walk around the house. The top end is clear and the middle is good too. Bass is okay, but no real issue with that for the function these provide. Dimmer and sound controls on the software are handy, and I really have no complaints (now). Thanks, Sengled for remedying a customer issue promptly. Nothing inherently wrong with the product - I think I just got a faulty pair originally, and once the issue was corrected, am a happy customer."},{"reviewerName":"adam","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Five Stars","reviewDate":"December 30, 2015","reviewText":"Awesome they sound great easy to use worth the money"},{"reviewerName":"Mario Castro","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Amazing sound","reviewDate":"May 30, 2019","reviewText":"Great product.

These strike me as more specialized for young adults or teens or DJs or something."},{"reviewerName":"Carol Hartman","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Four Stars","reviewDate":"February 17, 2016","reviewText":"Bought these for our son...he loves them!"},{"reviewerName":"Mauricio Jose Maldonado Valencia","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Waste of money","reviewDate":"March 30, 2016","reviewText":"Not work, only if there is a unique light with one switch.

With space being limited more and more, being able to put compact speakers in places that you normally would not is a great idea. The problem is that the execution is terrible for the following reasons:\n\n1. These are not waterproof and you cannot use outside (many people would like to use something like this on their patio.)\n2. This is bluetooth and not wifi. Therefore you have to have a bluetooth device to use them and for most people, that is their cell phone.\n3. The light has a small illumination area. I put this in a fixture that illumininates the entire room but the light is focused directly down and only illuminated that area.\n4. Once the light goes out, you will have to replace the unit.\n5. I never got the Master unit to connect with my cell phone.\n\nBased on this, I would look for other products to do the same."},{"reviewerName":"Danny A.","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Fantastic product!","reviewDate":"May 9, 2014","reviewText":"I was turned on to this product by a good friend of mine and they are truly amazing! I placed the pair in my patio with the hopes that they would be OK- was I wrong! The sound quality is great and the freedom to stream anything is fantastic.\n\nThe simple app that you download to control the brightness and volume are extremely simple to use that a non \"techie\" person would have no problems with it.\n\nSet up for the pair took around 2 minutes and that was mainly for downloading the app.\n\nI am looking to purchase another pair for my family room."},{"reviewerName":"Alex Sorto","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great concept","reviewDate":"September 21, 2019","reviewText":"These are great 2 in 1 light and by speakers with desent sound considering very compact and the and combo.
