The wireless cards quit. One day you'll likely find that the device has disappeared from your system. That's when the fun begins.\n\nFirst you'll spend 30 minutes on hold trying to reach customer service. This will remind you of your dealings with credit card companies or online retailers. They don't seem to care and it shows;)\n\nWhen you get a tech on the line they'll have you open a trouble shooting app and enter the devices info. Then they'll ask you to get the device and plug it into your router via cable. At this point they'll confirm that the unit has lost its wireless card. Then they'll have you start a second help ticket in their app, and enter your shipping and device registration again while promising to send an RMA and exchange the device.\n\nThen after a couple days you'll get an email. Asking you to enter your shipping address and the units serial #, yet again. At this point I'm guessing that you won't have the serial # with you so you'll have to return to the failed device and get it, again...\n\nThen after a day or two you'll yet another email asking if you would like to drop your failed unit off at UPS or print a label. At this point a week has gone by and you'll start to wonder which government program their customer service is modeled after. Finally after boxing it up, exchanging emails like pen pals and shipping it off, all you'll have to do is wait. A week or so later your replacement unit will arrive.\n\nIt's going to require that you to dedicate some time to the process and keep a sense of humor while repeating the same information over and over...;)"},{"reviewerName":"HandyMark","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Nice product, horrible support, glitchy software","reviewDate":"August 6, 2018","reviewText":"Had I rated this product earlier (I've had it for a year), I would have given it 5 stars. Nice sound, convenient, and their support setting it up was excellent. Unfortunately, the app has quit recognizing it. Going to the Sonos website, I found that even finding technical support was difficult, and clicking on any specific issue brings you in an endless loop. Tried to call, only to be told a one-hour wait, and no way to leave a call-back number as many support sites do. Once I finally figured out how to email them, I got a reply (a full day later) telling me how to upload diagnostic info, which I did. After hearing nothing back, I realized that I had to send ANOTHER email to support with my prior case number and the diagnostic number. You'd think that they'd get back to you once they have all the info.\n\nAs my product is just over a year old, my guess is that I'm screwed, though I need to find the warranty. I get having wireless problems, but the way their support has degraded in just a year is appalling.\n\nWill update the review if/when I actually hear back from them.\n\n2/19 update: Was going to change this to 4 stars, as they did replace my unit. Still curious what will happen when the wireless quits after the warranty expires, as they don't seem very user-serviceable. My new complaint is with their software. Works pretty flawlessly when using a streaming service such as Pandora. The issue seems to be when playing music from your own music library. I've copied all of my CD's onto a music folder on my computer so that I can play them on the Sonos. Probably every second or third time I try playing from this folder, the Sonos software can't find it. So, I need to remove the folder and re-add the folder before playing any music from it. This is a time-consuming practice; by the time it's complete, I'm no longer in the mood to hear the music I wanted."},{"reviewerName":"Stephan Sylvan","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Two defective Play 5 units and terrible customer service","reviewDate":"November 24, 2018","reviewText":"Up until a few months ago I was a big fan of Sonos, loving the sound quality and ability to control the music through my phone or computer. But then the Play 5 I purchased about 1 year ago just stopped working due to a known issue with a defective wifi or network card according to Sonos tech support. That was bad but what followed was far worse. After attempting to fix the unit over the phone, they promised to send a new unit but for weeks it never came. Turns out the rep I talked to on the phone failed to tell me that I had to jump through more hoops including giving them my credit card so they could charge me for a new one if I failed to return the defective one in 14 days. So I jumped through those additional hoops and a new one arrived. A few weeks later that replacement Play 5 stopped working just like the first one. Remarkably, it had a defective wifi / network card according to tech support just like the first one! This time the customer support person, who seemed a bit embarrassed, promised to send a new one with overnight delivery. He seemed nice and concerned so I waited for the new one to arrive. But it didn't come for days. When I called back they said I had to jump through additional hoops on their website never mentioned on the call. Why would they promise to send me a new one the next day but not tell me about the additional steps I need to take to make it happen? By this time I was quite upset. I must have made 10 to 12 calls to Sonos waiting 15 to 25 minutes on hold each time. To make it right they gave me a 30% discount code for a new purchase. But that code was only worth about 10% compared to Sonos prices at a big box retailer. I can't believe such a strong premium brand that charged me $500 for the original Play 5 would treat customers this way."},{"reviewerName":"marc kaplan","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Caution: Serious problem with the SONOS wifi cards.","reviewDate":"August 31, 2017","reviewText":"Buyer Beware!!! Apparently, SONOS has problems with the wifi controller in the PLAY:5 system resulting in wifi connectivity eventually failing, leaving only Ethernet connectivity as an option. In the last 6 months, I have had 3 units RMA. Considering the price of these units and a one-year warranty, if the wifi fails, which appears to be very possible, you will be stuck with a brick."},{"reviewerName":"Audib-Klaus","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Reduced functionality after purchase.","reviewDate":"August 27, 2017","reviewText":"I own three Sonos 5, six Sonos 1, and one Sonos Sub.\nOverall I thgink they are expensive, for what they offer, but if you have the money, and do not want to spend a lot of time setting up complicated hardware the Sonos were right for you. Good sound. Easy Interface.\nBut the arrogance of Sonos of SOnos towards their customers is quite unique even compared to other IT companies, and is therefore ultimately leading to me selling my equipment.\n1.) You will be forced to register with personal data to operate the loudspeakers, Privacy Policy (Aug / 17): \"...As part of the registration, you will need to set up a Sonos account .. We collect: your name, phone number, email address, location data, your password, passwords hints and IP address\" Why do you force me to give my name to use a speaker?\n2.) As soon as a new firmware version is provided, you can no longer access certain menu items of the exiting firmware. The basic functions for listening to music continue to work, but certain advanced settings are no longer available until you update the fiirmware. For example, most annoyingly you can no longer add new speakers. Even advanced settings for your own local music library are no longer available. If you buy soft- or hardware, generally a company offers you not to install upgrades if you accept sticking with the current functionality. Sonos downgrades you to force you to upgrade your firmware.\n3.) Now (August) a new firmwareupdate has come out. To download this, you will be forced to accept the new data protection guidelines as well. These allow Sonos to collect significantly more data than before, for example with regards to the built-in microphones, or Sonos recording what music was heard when / where / by whom. I don't want t discuss, whether the new rules are \"good\" or \"bad\", as everyone has a different opinion. But it is a fact that they are significantly different from the privacy rules when I bought my speakers just 6 months ago. And Sonos acknowledges that the Sonos speakers will ultimately cease to work if you don't accept the new privacy policy.\nIN SUMMARY: I understand that Google & Facebook collect data, to privide their free service. But I think, when I spend 4.000 US$ on a hifi system, I should have the right to my privacy. And even more so I should have the right to the rules not changing after my purchase. Because what's the point of any privacy policy, if the manufacturer can blackmail me into accepting whatever he wants after my purchase."},{"reviewerName":"Lucas","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Awesome sound system, but make sure this is for you","reviewDate":"April 6, 2017","reviewText":"I'm glad this is what I went with after months of researching and debating. First of all, and most important, the sound is great. I wanted something that filled my open concept downstairs living room and kitchen with high quality sound. I've used it to entertain for a party, to rock out to some good ole rock and roll, and for background music while making dinner, and it performs great at all levels. I have not had any of the intermittent issues that some of the low reviews mention. I have one of the higher speeds internet, but it's nothing special.\n\nThe app makes it easy to set up the system and I really liked the sound tuning option. I like that I can access multiple music sources like Spotify, Amazon prime music, Pandora, etc, from the app. Much better than having to go into every app to find what you are looking for. The user interface is more basic than the actual music apps, but it does what I need it to, which is search, find, play.\n\nI don't mind not having a the Bluetooth option. It hasn't affected me, but I can see how some people find that to be an issue. I also understand that Sonos wants to keep their sound system a hi-fi system and the Bluetooth sound quality is not as good.\n\nIn terms of aesthetics, this is an elegant piece, and even my interior designer wife was happy with the looks.\n\nThe price point is high, so make sure you are willing to make the investment. My plan is to eventually grow my system, and that capability was another selling point for my needs."},{"reviewerName":"pcs","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"won't stay connected","reviewDate":"September 8, 2018","reviewText":"My play 1s stay connected.

Three years ago I started getting the Play 1's, and those kept multiplying until I have a large herd of them around the house.\n\nI had listened to the play 3 and old generation play 5 and thought for the most part the new tech in the Play 1's are superior.\n\nNow enter the new Play 5 with all the new tech and more and better speakers. I initially got one thinking I could do a stereo pair and compare it with the Play 1. That was a no go. Sonos software does not allow this pairing. Only like with like. So now I had to order another one, ouch that was costly.\n\nNow that they are all setup in a stereo pair and did the custom sound procedure that sonos developed, they sound great. I did a side by side with the paired Play 1's and here is my findings. They both sound great. They both have great bass response and highs. Where they part ways is the midranges, the detail, and the soundstage.\n\nThe Play 5's take what was good in the Play 1's and make it better. They are also a lot louder for when you really want to pump some sound. You don't need the sub with the Play 5's. I have one, but it is really not needed anymore. The sub still does well for sure, but its kind of like there is a baby sub in each play five and the sub goes, Hey Im Here Too... Hey You Still Need Me Right?\n\nThe Play 5's are big and very heavy. About fourteen pounds each. Solid as a rock. Each speaker inside the Play 5 has its own amp.\n\nI am glad I have them, but it was painful buying two. You really don't need two for a pretty big room unless you want to pair them in stereo. The also can sense how you place them and the sound is changed automatically for vertical and horizontal. Horizontal does sound a bit better but I prefer the look of the vertical on my shelves. Also takes up less room and I did not have much to spare where I placed them.\n\nA little side note for those who have connection or interference issues. Do not buy a bridge, those are semi worthless. The Boost is much better. And something they don't advertise is that the sonos connect has the most powerful transmitter that will cut through interference like a light saber. I was running my system in a long house without it and was having connection problems all over the place. Hooked the connect back up in the middle of the house and it took over the signal from the boost. No more drops. Did not even have the connect connected to anything other than the ethernet."},{"reviewerName":"MSM","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Sonos Is No Longer Remotely Reliable - Avoid At All Costs","reviewDate":"December 18, 2018","reviewText":"We have several homes and have purchased scores of Sonos players and controllers over the years. I hesitate to think how much I have spent on Sonos. Sonos products always been somewhat buggy and never fully lived up to their potential, but we persisted because the concept seemed great. After years of frustration, however, I am officially giving up on Sonos. Sonos constantly updates its app and desktop controller to incorporate this or that \"new feature,\" and more often than not, the upgrade brings new problems. Everything is incredibly buggy, and nothing is designed for any level of scalability. Testing seems to be non-existent. If you buy a Sonos product, prepare to be a human guinea pig. So if you are thinking about buying one or two players, perhaps you should consider Sonos, though even then, I would recommend you get something else. (Having 5 or 10 players brings major headaches, in part because a favorite recommendation of Sonos support is to \"reset\" all of your Sonos players, a process that can take an hour or more with multiple players.) So don't even think about a system consisting of 5 or 10 different players, and avoid the new Beam at all costs. Nothing will work seamlessly, and you will find yourself constantly fiddling, actually fixing things only if you are lucky. Sonos support is reasonably good, but if you have to spend hours online or on the phone with support every month or so, then perhaps the problem is really with the product. Be prepared for Sonos to blame your router, network and you for every problem, at least in the first instance, but at the end of the day, this company has lost its way, all the more so since the recent IPO. Sonos deserves to fail and should. Get a few HomePods or Google products. Not nearly as slick as Sonos, but way, way more reliable."},{"reviewerName":"DBH","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Warranty Issues","reviewDate":"January 4, 2018","reviewText":"Sounds good until time for a warranty claim, then you cannot get in touch with that dept."},{"reviewerName":"Timbuckyball","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Spectacular audio fidelity, simple intuitive software","reviewDate":"April 4, 2016","reviewText":"I write contemporary instrumental music and use professional studio monitor speakers to mix the final songs. In addition they are mastered by a professional engineer. This gives me a very good feel for how well audio systems perform, by using my finished songs as standards. Regarding Sonos sound, the speaker default bass is definitely too high. That is easily attenuated with the controls on your computer or phone. After that change I can say with confidence that this speaker has remarkable fidelity over nearly the full range of volume. The frequency response is simply phenomenal. Volume is more than adequate for most purposes.\n\nThe software is very intuitive, at least on my iOS or Mac systems. Once plugged in, it took me 5 minutes to begin playing music from my Apple music account or from my personal collection.

Tech support, which used to be responsive and well-informed, is slow to respond and clueless as to resolving issues.

The latter was especially important to me and the fact that this Sonos speaker has a line-in port made this decision a no-brainer. And that's where this speaker majorly disappointed me.\n\nWhen I connected my record player through the line-in port with a classic audio jack, the speaker started making this annoying hissing/static noise and it wouldn't disappear when I started playing music. It would actually get more audible the more I increased the volume. At first, I thought the issue was with the record player because I've had audio problems with different record players before. However, when I connected my phone through the line-in port, the hissing noise was still there. Then I tried using different cords and combinations of cords. Unfortunately, every time I selected line-in as the source, the hissing/static sound would resume regardless of the device/cord attached to the speaker.\n\nI went online and read a number of articles and message boards in which people were describing the exact same problem. I played around with the EQ and with the line-in settings in the Sonos app to no avail. I reached out to Sonos' customer service team and they were of little help.\n\nI have to say, when the speaker was connected to my phone through the wireless connection, the sound was flawless (hence the extra star in my review). However, reading all the other reviews on here, it sounds like that flawlessness has an expiration date as well.\n\nEventually, I decided to return the speaker. I wasted way too much time for a $500 product that's supposed to just work. This is a really expensive speaker and I am baffled at how poor its quality is. Besides, it's way too big and clunky - it looks like a giant brick on top of my credenza.\n\nAnyway, feel free to try it for yourself and see if it works for you but be warned that there are will probably be issues with it.

The Sonos App on Windows could use a little improvement as I have to push the play button twice as the first time it will say it can't recognize the speakers, another minus on versatility. There used to be an issue with switching from Spotify App and Sonos App where the volume would come on full blast, so yes, the speakers are really loud, don't compromise sound quality for volume, and I am probably in need for another pair of ear drums. The Pandora and Spotify Apps work well and I can even play my own music, I don't understand how people can't connect their personal libraries up, worked just fine for me.

However, my decision to purchase this and another speaker from the Sonos family was more about ease of use through the app and what music I could listen to. Recently support stopped to enable listening to music that is on one's phone; now you primarily can use this to listen to music through a music streaming service such as Spotify, or, oh yeah, Amazon Music. Many of us still have music that we've acquired over many years and do not wish to pay someone a monthly fee to listen to only a fraction of the music we've loved over a lifetime. So this has become a large annoying reminder of what I have lost convenient access to instead of a speaker system I can use to listen to my preferred music. I would never have bought these speakers if I had known they were going to change the format of the music I could listen to at their whim."},{"reviewerName":"KZ","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"They work fine in general","reviewDate":"January 24, 2018","reviewText":"Well, I had two of these speakers for a little over 6 months. They work fine in general, until the most recent software update. Right after the update, one of the speaker could no longer join the untouched wireless network, while the other was fine. Back-and-forth with the tech support on their community webpage, not helpful at all. If you said you did something, the response would be \"that's wrong. Unplug everything, restart the router, wait a few minutes, place the speakers to their original places...blahblahblah...\" They just ignored the fact that one of the speakers connected without problems. So how the hell is the router the issue? Very disappointed.\n\nUpdate: I called in to Sonos customer service and was told that the offline speaker actually needed to be replaced due to malfunction of its wireless card. The return and replacement process was quite easy and fast. I got my replacement speaker today. The customer service was satisfactory. But the quality of the product is a concern considering I only had the speakers for less than 7 months. I will up one star on the review ranking for their customer service."},{"reviewerName":"Ready Eddie","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"sound is as advertised","reviewDate":"November 2, 2018","reviewText":"great sound, as advertised. fills our whole living room with high fidelity. While I'm sure a two speaker solution will sound much more true stereo, I'm still quite impressed with the stereo image the Play 5 delivers. set up was easy and the app works great. apple airplay support adds to versatility. TWO CONCERNS: wifi connection, as others have mentioned, isn't robust, many inexplicable drop outs despite strong wifi signal. This needs to be rectified, like yesterday. Ridiculous for such a high end product that there isn't more of a buffer to mitigate and/or better connectivity circuitry. Second, and I imagine this goes hand in hand with the first concern, as others have mentioned, there can be syncing issues with video. I don't experience this with all video content websites, but with HBO NOW the delay makes using the speaker unusable for movie watching. As others have mentioned, this, too, is unacceptable in such high end kit, especially in a product thats been around for years now. Should have been fixed/solution offered eons ago. Yes, I'm sure the aux input probably mitigates this problem, although I haven't tried it yet. But theres just no point in having a wifi surround speaker that has such delay issues -- and the app doesn't offer a time compensation feature. These are considerable disappointments. I didn't try the Naim competitor but kind of wish I'd at least tried it out. So overall, I'm mostly pleased with the Play 5 and fingers crossed that these ancillary issues are addressed soon."},{"reviewerName":"Scott Cruce","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Bang, Bang, goes the wallet!

The musicsources, premium and free, are great and you can always find something to listen to. Grimacing at the price tag at Christmas time, I nonetheless shelled out money for the big daddy of the Sonos group, hoping I would not be disappointed. I had read several reviews of horrible customer support and lots of instances with failing parts on the 5, but decided to chance it anyway because of the reported great quality of the sound. To keep this short, I have not been disappointed, and now the 5 rips out through the living room with plenty of awesome support from my older Sonos speakers in my bedroom and my office. I know this says it works with Alexa, but since I hate talking to technology and therefore wouldn't buy one of the things if you paid me, I will not comment on Alexa. Still, for the money this costs, I think it is worth it especially if you have other speakers that can support it in different rooms. PSSSSSSST.

I almost exclusively stream to this speaker through the Spotify App -- I just tap \"devices available\" on my iPhone, iPad or MacBook and the speaker automatically appears via Spotify Connect because all the devices are on the same wireless network.

NOTE: you still need to plug into power, but no speaker wire to run. Sound quality is good as the Sonos speakers really fill up a room with great sound. I thought the Bass and Midrange was really good. No issues streaming music from around the house.\n\nPositives:\n- Great and clean design. Huge improvement from last generation. You can stand it up vertically or horizontally.\n- Easy to setup.\n- Great sound. Even better if you pair it up in stereo mode where you can hook up two speakers to separate the L & R Channels. However, even a single speaker sounds great as there are internal speakers that the software will separate.\n- Setup software allows you to do a \"sound check\" on the iPhone app and will provide EQ settings that are optimal for your room listening experience.\n- Streaming was great. No breakup of audio stream. I have seen issues with some blue tooth speakers, but haven't experienced anything negative with Sonos.\n- Overall very satisfied with these wireless speakers. No need to run wires anymore. Now if we can do something about the power cord ...\n\nTradeoffs\n- Overall Software. You must use the Sonos software to play music through the speakers. If you're used to using iTunes or whatever software you normally use, then you'll have to adjust a little. For example, Pandora or Amazon run within the Sonos app.\n- Ability to stream anything to the speakers is a little problematic. For example, if you want to stream audio from a TV show you're watching on your computer to the speakers is not possible or at least I can't figure it out. You can however connect a physical line-in/out audio cable from your computer directly to the speaker to do that.\n- One thing I noticed about the power cable design in the back is that it is a bit flimsy and easy to splice the outer housing of the, so be careful as you plug/unplug and pack the device."},{"reviewerName":"Lennyd","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"... are listening to a streaming radio station or something like Spotify.

I guess this should be obvious but it wasn't to me until I subscribed to Spotify. You can't play the free Spotify on Sonos, only premium Spotify. Sirius/XM doesn't sound all that great. Neither do most streaming stations. That can be due to a number of factors like the bitrate the radio station streams at how and how they compress their signal.

Sonos recently updated their privacy policy, allowing themselves to collect voice information on my house and use it any way they want to (the latest Sonos have microphones in them). Excuse me? I am not giving you blanket permission to spy on me and my family.\n\nNeedless to say, I refused to acknowledge this and refused the software upgrade. In return, Sonos bricked my $2,500 investment.

I love this speaker. I have it integrated with my Alexa (by way of Smartthings), Smartthings, Harmony remote, and my Smart TV. It's my music player, alarm clock, streaming audio, status announcer (e.g. \"The front door is open\", \"The temperature is 72 degrees\", etc.), it is the voice of my Alexa (by using line in and a separate bluetooth receiver), it is a secondary Siren for my smoke and CO detector and intruder alarm, it is my TV speaker, and it is decoration (I say this last part because I think it is a very nice looking speaker). Don't let the size fool you. It has some SERIOUS bass. Obviously it's not a sub, but as close as you can get without adding a dedicated subwoofer (btw, I used to be an audio engineer, so I know a good speaker when I hear one). And that kind of leads me into the quality of the sound. I didn't test the frequency response or the 1W 1M dB SPL, etc, etc... all that's on the spec sheet, I'm sure. But just the subjective opinion of a guy whose seen and tested HUNDREDS of speakers.... this speaker sounds fantastic. I might have bought it just for the sound quality even if it didn't have all the other bells and whistles. You will NOT be disappointed. The app could be a little better designed. And my only other complaint is that I wish that it would default back to the \"line-in\" when a transient signal comes in from another source. But I worked around that minor flaw using my Smartthings app and CoRE (a rule engine for smartthings). But you don't have to be all tech-y to use this. It's basically plug and play. Just sign in with your favorite music service from the app... or connect with your computer or phone through the app with a couple of clicks... or just plug something into the back... and you're off.\n\nOnly one other minor complaint was that I thought it was poor insight of Sonos to make a non-removeable logo. That means that if I want a stereo pair upright then they would look funny with the logo pointing the same way on both sides. But then I realized that it was me that had the poor insight. They put little rubber feet (the good ones that won't come off...ever) on all 3 sides... and I realized... what is SONOS upside down? Duh! So, it can easily be set up to look symmetrical when using as a stereo pair. Seems they thought of everything... even down to how their name would look.\n\nI loved this one product SOOOOO much that I just bought a Playbar, a sub, and 12 Play 1 speakers to make a full on 5.1 and put more speakers all over the rest of my house."},{"reviewerName":"Jeff","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Excellent value","reviewDate":"October 17, 2016","reviewText":"I was skeptical that a relatively small package could deliver a good listening experience, but after reading reviews and hearing a good report from my audio pro friend, I took the plunge and tried the Sonos 5.

I was impressed starting with the Chat capability at the Sonos website where they answered my many questions real time ...when I purchased the product it was evident that this was a company that focused on quality from end to end. Quality is evdident in the details from the packaging to the App.\nThe app was awesome and the installation was elegant and sophisticated . The music sounds great from the Speakers...music sounds good with only one Speaker in the room but I preferred to have them paired...the ability to walk thru my house in the different rooms and listen to music is exactly what I was hoping for and there is no lag or echo between rooms ....it is easy to use the App to group or ungroup the rooms. You can even play a raido station in one room while listening to music in the other rooms. It is really amazing it is so flexible. I can play my Audible books by plugging in my Echo Dot and using the Line In feature from the App. I look forward to when Sonos and Audible are more closely integrated...and apparently there are plans to have more synergy with Amazon Echo and the Sonos speakers. Anyway...other than the fact I couldn't stop buying more until I had 2 in every room....I am very happy. Although I chose to use Sonos 5's in most rooms there is one room that I used a pair of Sonos 1's and they too sound great.....I have been very impressed!!

Same thing. has to be controlled by phone app. EQ is really limited considering it's $500 per unit. it has only two tone control and stereo option i expected more. considering it's totally based on phone app it's a glorified speaker only. i rather spend the money on a Bose system with everything built in. Also if you want different music to play in different room using Amazon music you have to get a multi user account. there is only one speaker head set jack if you want to hard wire this to devise. it still needs work in my opinion. the new 5g wireless has issues connecting. perhaps i was expecting too much given that it's a external speakers for a devise. basically it's a computer speaker that is on steroids. would i spent thousands to hook up my house with it? i doubt it very much."},{"reviewerName":"Kam Bajwa","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"THE best sound solution...PERIOD","reviewDate":"January 13, 2019","reviewText":"I kick myself for wasting so many years with big bulky 7.1 speaker systems which required an expensive receiver and cables etc etc\nThis is the best sound I have heard from almost any speaker at any price point (under $3000)"},{"reviewerName":"donna jackson","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Awesome sound, best part is","reviewDate":"March 27, 2016","reviewText":"Awesome sound, best part is, I had trouble syncing it to my play bar, I wasn't setting it up right, I called the tech support, only waiting a few minutes on hold, then tech support rep accessed my system so he could see what was going on, then he walked me through step by step.

I say this is my \"first\" Sonos speaker because I expect to be buying more over the coming months. Before buying the Play 5, I had purchased a W9 speaker from Definitive Technology. The W9 has incredible sound. But the one I got was broken and would only connect by the audio jack. So it went back. I was also not impressed with the Definitive app and so I decided to try a different company. The Sonos app had great reviews and the more I read the more I decided that functionality is also very important. So I ordered the Play 5.\nThe Play 5 easily connected to my home network and to my iPhone 6. The Sonos app works great and it plays very nice with the Spotify app. The Play 5 also connected very easily with my wife's iPhone and iPad. But it would not connect to my older iPad. So I sent emails to Sonos discussing the issue I was having. After the first idea didn't fix the problem, they suggested I contact them and work in real time. I did that and I was EXTREMELY impressed with the problem solving capabilities of the tech I talked with. He connected to my network and quickly diagnosed the source of the communication problem in my home network. A firmware update to my router and everything was fixed and working great on my iPad! That's right ... the problem had nothing to do with their product, but they helped me identify the problem and resolve the issue with one 20 minute phone call. Now that's what I call super service!\nSo what can I say about the Play 5 sound quality? It's very very good. I must say, however, it is not quite as good as the sound I got from the W9. But I am still very happy with the quality. And the functionality and service more than make up for the tiny difference in sound quality.\nI also have a Simply Smart hub in my house that provides lots of convenient automation. The Play 5 also works with this system and will play text to speech announcements to warn me of potential issues. Just icing on the cake that the W9 couldn't touch ...\nSo my recommendation is the following... if you want great sound, excellent functionality and support then get a Sonos Play 5. If you want the very best sound you can get at this sized speaker and price range and you don't mind the hassles of poor functionality then maybe the W9 is a better option for you. For me, I'm very happy with my first Play 5 and I expect continued satisfaction as I expand."},{"reviewerName":"TaylorC","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Perfect sound, and an excellent addition to the Playbar ...","reviewDate":"April 24, 2017","reviewText":"Perfect sound, and an excellent addition to the Playbar and Sub (for surround sound in a living room).

Plug things in, hit the app and everything just finds each other. It took me longer to unpack the speakers than to hook them up. The packaging for these things is better than anything I have unboxed. They took the time to make sure everything fit and fit in the box perfectly along with the heft of the cardboard. So packaging gets an A+\n\nSpeakers:\nPLAY 1 - great speaker, smallish size with a bit of heft to the speaker. This will be my only negative thing about SONOS and it's not really a negative but if I had it to do over again I would have spent the extra $100 for additional PLAY 3 speakers and not the PLAY 1.\n\nPLAY 3 - this speaker kicks, it's highs are high it's lows are low and the sound is amazing. With two of these in a stereo set up they fill the room with sound and do sound great.\n\nPLAY 5 - OK MAC DADDY - this is THE speaker but the price is brutal but again, this is THE speaker. I have two of these in a big room and it FILLS the room with sound. I would buy all PLAY 5's if money and space were not an issue. This is a BIG speaker with big sound and a BIG price tag.\n\nAMP - I already had a great set of Klipsch speakers with a big subwoofer so I thought the AMP would be a good purchase. I was right. The sound through my speakers is amazing, my sub adds to the rest of my speakers so I can dial up the treble a bit to brighten the room. I was surprised that this amp would drive my speakers coming from a big Yamaha receiver but it does and does it well. The speakers like power so they work best at higher volumes but I'm also filling a big room with sound so it works well. I tend to run these when I am running another set in a near room for fill and the added punch of my subwoofer. If you have a good set of speakers the AMP is the way to go to use those speakers with your new set up.\n\nSONOS BOOST - I went with this just because I thought a secondary network would be better, I can't say if it is or it isn't but I do know my music sounds great with no drops & all my other devices don't seem to care I have a few SONOS speakers playing at the same time.\n\nAll in all this is BIG investment, but well worth it for the ease of set up and the sound quality of this system. I have been an audiophile for years and this is not audiophile quality as I am streaming SiriusXM or Pandora but with some of my lossless music this system holds it own.\n\nEven if you just pick up one speaker, this system will change your music habits but it is also like a dangerous drug, you'll want more and more. I'm up to 11 pieces of SONOS equipment so you know I love it, I just don't like spending all that money.\n\nUPDATE: 10/29/16\n\nWe still LOVE our SONOS, we are building an addition on our house and new garage. Needless to say all rooms will be SONOS equipped. I am having the electricians add outlets so I can mount my SONOS and have the ability to move them. I am also adding outdoor speakers (NOT SONOS) so I am having the speaker wires run to a closet so I can put a SONOS AMP in there to drive the outdoor speakers.\n\nAdding to the system with the additon, SONOS AMP, 2x Play5 for bedroom, 2x Play1 for master bath, 2x Play3 for family/great room, 2x Play5 for garage (yes my garage ROCKS, I had a Yamaha receiver w/4 speakers & sub in garage I'm tearing down) also adding a SONOS Sub for a little more low end (I have a Klipsch 1000w powered sub in my living room so will need more bass punch in the new part of the house).\n\nSadly I'm sure I'll add more as time and funds permit, kitchen remodel next summer and I'm deciding how and where I want to mount my SONOS so when I'm cookin' I can be rockin' also...\n\nSomeday there will be a \"support group\" for us SONOS junkies, I can't stop..."},{"reviewerName":"S.

These speakers are a POS!\nSecond update: After speaking with tech I now have my speaker system hooked up in the best way and it is working great. For me, it is not inconvenient to hard-wire two of the speakers to my router (instead of using Wifi) and this makes all the difference. I love SONOS.\nUPDATE: When the system works, it is fantastic, but way too often the system crashes and it is really becoming annoying. I had originally scored this system 5 STAR, but now they are down to 2 STARs and falling. Below is my original review:\n\nI have two of these in the living room for truly outstanding stereo sound. And it is so incredible easy (even fun) to set it up through the smartphone app. The app allows access to a computer music library as well as access to streaming music from all the major sources. There is even a way to set up the treble and bass and balance though the app. Sonos speakers in different rooms can even play from different sources at the same time. I feel so smug, having yet another use for my iPhone.\nThere is no need for such a setup in my TV room, where I already have all my surround sound components, but in other rooms, for example, my living room, which has a fireplace and where we particularly like to sit when not watching TV, this item is ideal.

These definitely rival the sound of the Bose systems, which I didn't think was possible. Invite your friends over, bust out the party lights, add some tunes to your Sonos playlist and you have yourself a party!!"},{"reviewerName":"celticdick","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"My wife and I are enjoying awesome sounds that fill our large home from just this ...","reviewDate":"March 12, 2017","reviewText":"This speaker is OUTSTANDING!!!

The sound is certainly some of the best I have heard from a Sonos product. It's a solid built, looks beautiful on either side (vertical or horizonal set up).

Those without unwavering loyalty need not join.\n\nCons: The software user experience is dated, there is no Universal Windows Platform (UWP) app, there is no Bluetooth receiver, there is not control on the speaker to turn the external audio input on/off- you have to launch the app, DLNA (Digital Living Network Alliance) is not officially supported, unknown if it contains a microphone to accept voice commands with a future update, you have to stay within the Sonos ecosystem if you want multiple speakers to be in sync- there is a 30 second delay between the speaker playing a local radio station and the station playing on my shower radio (some of which is an Internet delay), and Sonos doesn't have a portable speaker- preferably water resistant for use in the shower.\n\nPros: There is a 1/8\" audio input, so you can either plug your audio source directly into it, or get an external Bluetooth receiver and plug it in, such as http://amzn.to/2csVOqh.

They allow you to play music thru-out your living space wirelessly.\nFurther, you can select speakers(other Sonos products) to play different tracks simultaneously.\nYou can choose songs from your music library to form a cue.\nRe:cue; you can change the song order, add/delete, SAVE etc. Like an ITunes playlist, only better.\nYou can adjust EQ via Bass/Treble control.\nYou can adjust volume or mute, pause/continue, cue fwd/rev, etc.\nI'm able to play music stored on my PC, controlled by my phone/tablet. (you don't need music on each device)\nTuneIn radio (comes with the software) has 100,000 stations to choose from. They play flawlessly.\nYou can do all this from your PC, tablet or smart phone. How do you top this?\nSEVERAL people can perform all these functions SIMULTANEOUSLY. (which gets interesting when your child is home from college LOL)\n\nIf you ask me, it's a miracle! \"Ah but, setup must be difficult!\", you say.\nNope, setup was a snap. Once unpackaged and plugged in, I downloaded the software and configured the speakers in less than 30 minutes. REALLY! The software is simple and intuitive.\n\nCons:\nPrice\nI wish they had a better equalizer program. The current one has a basic treble/bass slide bar.\nI wish they had outdoor speakers. I wish they had wireless headphones.\n\nNote:\nSonos product all require AC electric supply i.e. plug them in. They're wireless, not battery operated; which I think is a good thing.\nMy experience:\nMy highest priority was to be able to play music off my PC located in the 26'x26' kitchen/LR/DR open floor plan, over a set of decent quality speakers. The thought of integrating the whole house seemed wonderful, albeit unattainable. We listen to a variety of music, but mostly rock, jazz and jazz fusion. Occasionally, we like to blast it. How loud? \"loud enough to NOT hear myself sing\" LOL. I wanted to \"hit it out of the park\", so I wound up buying 2 Play:5s and Sonos Sub.\nFirst, I set up the Play:5s to see if/how they would work. They immediately reminded me of Apple products with they're ridiculous gratuitous packaging. I mean the boxes alone must cost $25! LOL\nAs I said, the setup was a snap. I downloaded the app from the Sonos site*. It loaded quickly and I was on my way. Setup** was a couple of screens similar to pairing blue tooth stuff. What did take a while, was importing my 10K track music library(There's a serious issue here too! see below.)\n\nAs for sound quality, I'd rate the speakers as \"very good\", to \"excellent\". If one considers the size of the format, ease of setup and they are wireless, I'd say \"excellent\"! I paired the speakers as stereo and listened to flawless music stream for about an hour. The bass response was so good, I almost didn't open the sub. I'm glad I did! While a huge expense for a seemingly frivolous component, the Sonos Sub is amazing! It definitely adds another dimension to the system.\n\nSeveral days later, I bought the Sonos starter set (2 Play:1s). I put one in the 12'x18' bedroom and one in the 24'x30' garage. Admittedly, these speakers do not deliver the sound quality of the 5's, but when you consider the size of the format, they absolutely rock!\nI'm saving my $ for more Sonos products!\n\n------------NOTES----------------------------------------------\n*I downloaded the app from Sonos. There's another app on the google app site which is rated rather low. I don't know if they are the same.\n**You need ethernet (hard wire) connection for the first Sonos product you install. Later, you can move remove the wire or move the speaker wherever you like.\n***my ITunes PLAY LISTS did NOT import. The library is all there and the playlists titles are there, but the data within the playlists is erroneous and does not play. I'm on Sono's site attempting to fix this. WARNING, there appears to be NO real FIX at this time.\nUPDATE: I found an esoteric file \"fix\". It will work short term. If you're good with your PC file system, you can do it too.\nFLASH! I was contacted by Sonos support regarding this post. I'll update.\n\nUPDATE-\nI'm about 30 days into these products. I listen to them almost daily. ( just ordered 2 more P5s)\nThe Music stream(over my network) has been flawless.\nI experienced 2 or 3 device \"lockups\" on my S5 phone, which were quickly averted with an app restart.\nMy ITunes playlist problem persists. Sonos has been very attentive, emailing me several times about it. They say the issue is in ITunes(I don't doubt them), but I can't find the playlist files in order to examine and repair them.\nI WISH the P5s had more treble (brighter). I play them with the treble setting maxed out 100% of the time.\nI WISH the software had a real equalizer, rather than the vanilla bass/treble adjustments.\nUPDATE-\nI purchased 2 additional P5s. Now I have 2P5s + Sub in one room(24'x24') and 2P5s standalone in another(20'x20' with lower ceiling). I'll say the standalones are still pretty impressive. In fact, the sub tends to be a bit over-the-top and requires adjustment on some songs. Generally for classical music I'll turn it up a notch, then have to back it off for rock music. It's interesting to hear the extra bass when listening to talk radio. The standalones are by NO MEANS lacking. Don't hesitate to get two P5s if you can't afford the sub."},{"reviewerName":"Overland On!","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Alexa/Echo works great too!","reviewDate":"November 6, 2017","reviewText":"Really impressed.

A $20 bluetooth one could do the job for small get togethers.\n\nI bought this for college. It is beyond worth it. I place it on my table and if the bass is slightly deep at a moderate volume I can feel vibrations. It is crisp and delivers powerful music. You can really crank it up too and just fill a room with loud while you enjoy some loud.\n\nWhile I do not get to use it at max very often, medium to medium high already gives quite a rich, pleasant experience daily. Setting up without a private wifi system was a bitch though. Buy this with the two sided jack if you plan on using your phone or computer with this if you are on public/shared wifi.\n\nI am definitely going to save up to buy the sub-woofers for when I move out and maybe another Play 5 just so I can feel real surround sound."},{"reviewerName":"E.

Go to Sonos site & download software onto desktop computer, was windows 8 & now 10, power up speakers to introduce to network & software. Problem is if you look at the on screen system, breath on it, turn on microwave, or stream video & change channel the system stops playing & does not respond. If you close & restart, then it has a problem loading selected music or playlist. When you do get to load up the que with music it can't find your system, speakers.

I took a lot of time researching both on Amazon and on other websites and to me, the sound quality is just okay. The highs are very brassy and the lows are muddy. I had high hopes! The integration with IOS is terrible as well and the app is not very user friendly. Debating on whether or not to return the item or just live with it because of its convenient expandability and integration with Alexa. The styling of the speaker is attractive. Looks way better than the Sonos 3 for sure. Overall, is it worth $500?

We got a Sonos Play:5 for our very large eat in kitchen and one for the living room, a SONOS Play:3 for the master BR and the basement playroom, and SONOS Play:1 for the kids rooms. I have successfully linked it to our music on iTunes. I moved the iTunes files to our Apple Airport, which is on all the time. This was the hardest step of the installation. I have also linked the SONOS app to Amazon Prime Music because we can access that through our Amazon Prime shipping status (who knew...I didn't until recently). All of the SONOS players have good audio quality, though only the 3 and 5 are in Stereo. The 5 is larger and more expensive, but it has a better sound than the 3--but only where it really counts in your house.\n\nWe have been listening to a lot more music. If everyone is doing their own thing, I can program to listen to NPR radio in the kitchen while I cook dinner and put on different music in the kids rooms. I can control everything from my iPad or iPhone. When we are cleaning and want some up-beat music (highly recommend Amazon's disco playlist), I can play it throughout the whole house.\n\nAgain, the only tricky thing was moving my iTunes library from my PC over to the Apple Airport, but everything else has been wonderful. I highly recommend the Sonos players. If you email the Sonos people, they will actually email you back with helpful tips and instructions if you get stuck. Not very common these days for sure."},{"reviewerName":"JOO","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Bought this to add to my Sonos system (playbar and ...","reviewDate":"May 25, 2018","reviewText":"Bought this to add to my Sonos system (playbar and sub), so that I can have music play in other rooms or outside in our yard."},{"reviewerName":"Tom","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great sound quality!","reviewDate":"June 21, 2019","reviewText":"Unreal!!"},{"reviewerName":"A B","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Not Impressed with Play 5","reviewDate":"August 28, 2018","reviewText":"Not Impressed with Play 5/Sub combo when compared to Bose."},{"reviewerName":"L.

You don't need two speakers.\nNo, you can not stream sounds to the Play5 directly from your computer or TV. There is a line input, but that's just silly considering its a wireless speaker. You can play music that's on your computer.\nYes, the app is very easy to use and the speaker is easy to install.

I recently moved and got rid of my giant speaker cabinets and other outdated sound components. I received the Sonos Play 5 in an amazing box; yes the packaging is impressive in itself. The speaker has some heft to it, feels well built, and looks good. Set up was simple, download the Sonos app and follow the directions, you must have WiFi because Sonos connects to your network. You tune the speaker by holding your phone in different areas of the room you will be in; the speaker is getting feedback and adjusting various outputs. Once set up you can pick from a multitude of streaming services to play, all of which are controlled by your phone. The sound is unbelievable! I have a very large living room with high ceilings and this speaker fills the room with rich, clear sound. The only downside, if it’s such a thing, I have to use an auxiliary audio line to play television sound through the speaker. You still use the app to control the television sound and you can’t use the television speakers simultaneously, as they are out of sync, think large stadium sound. I am completely sold on the Sonos system and will be purchasing additional speakers to place in other areas around my house. I have friends and family that use Bose and I would get this system over the Bose based on sound quality alone."},{"reviewerName":"Lee S.","rating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Not worth the money.","reviewDate":"June 17, 2019","reviewText":"Not as good as Play one for the money."},{"reviewerName":"BassBicyclist","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Works really well in our kitchen","reviewDate":"December 25, 2018","reviewText":"Everything - news programs, jazz, party music - sounds excellent and balanced.

I'm sure grandma looking for a bathroom speaker would be lost.\n\nSo the next step is to go to the basement to hardwire the thing and then try to connect that way. Then hope there are advanced settings to tell it about wifi, and then bring it back up here to see if it works. Time commitment is already boardering on something I could home rig.\n\nPunchline... The aux in doesnt seem to work while it's in the unsetup state. So sad.\n\nmore: glutton for punishment I figure maybe it broadcasts a local net for me to connect for setup purposes. So I hit the button in the back and the pulsing green turned pulsing orange (no docs on colors or anything). I found a wifi called SONOS!!! But it couldn't find a Sonos on the Sonos network. :(. Experimentally I hit the button in the back and watched the network go away. So on it goes...oh I just hit the button again and pulsing orange turned blinked orange...

It could also be an Android app issue as it only happens when I wake my S6 Edge to check calls/emails or (worst) when I am on a call..... that REALLY sucks to be on a professional call in your home office and music starts blaring! It will not stop either... every 10-15 seconds during the call it goes to play mode.\n\nBack to review. New Play 5 review and Sonos summary. I'll keep the review short.... I did not want to spend $500 on yet another Sonos speaker but I have to admit the new model blows the old model away! The sound is crisp, deep bass and the highs blend perfectly... it is also louder than the older Play 5. If you're on the fence just buy it..... trust me folks, I know more than the generals do.\n\nI have mixed reviews on the Sonos system in general, the platform is very buggy and clunky to operate. That said I am a believer in the philosophy of streaming music throughout the house without having to reconnect from BT speaker to BT speaker as you move about. The WiFi streaming is genius and does not seem to consume as much bandwidth as one may think. I have six Play 1's, a Play 3 and two Play 5 speakers (previous and current model). I was a little annoyed that the new Play 5 came out just a month or two after I purchased the previous model and I could not see dropping another $500 for the new model. As I am constantly trying to find the best location to place the speakers to get the desired sound I recently decided to add another Play 5. The setup now is Play 5 in the living room paired with two Play 1 (in-stereo) speakers, a Play 5 in the kitchen paired with one Play 1, a Play 3 in the bedroom paired with two Play 1 speakers and a Play 1 in my office. A Play 1 by itself does not do justice to the system but is a nice accessory to the Play 5 to fill out stereo surround."},{"reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Five Stars","reviewDate":"August 4, 2016","reviewText":"sounds just as good as Bose!"},{"reviewerName":"metaphysician","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"infinite stars.","reviewDate":"December 12, 2016","reviewText":"wow, this thing sounds amazing!\n\ni bought this and two play 1s to fill my house with music. setup was easy. the app just WORKS. i was concerned about running through a proprietary app, but Sonos has done it right. the app actually integrates all the music apps i use into one app, which is wonderful.\n\nSonos has re-invigorated my love of music."},{"reviewerName":"Gregg Hirsch","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Amazing Sound!","reviewDate":"October 23, 2016","reviewText":"I am very happy with this purchase. The sound from the PLAY5 really wowed me. I'm not exactly an audiophile but I can appreciate good sound and the PLAY5 provides it. What really impressed me was the power of this speaker when you crank the volume. The speaker is somewhat large but the when you turn the PLAY5 it really puts out immense sound with a nice bass. I also liked that the sound did not distort when turning it way up. In fact this speaker is somewhat too powerful for my living room home theater. When using it I primarily use it during the day or afternoon simply because it gets a bit too loud when the rest of the family is sleeping. This is not a bad thing!\n\nThe only criticism I have is I find myself having to pull the power cord out once in a while to reset the speaker when it looses network connectivity. I have my PLAY5 hard wired with cat5. I dont know why this happens but it doesnt happen that frequently. I also really enjoy the fact that the Sonos speakers integrate into my SmartThings smart home. Announcements are made through my Sonos speakers when a family member arrives home, and alarm is set off and many other events.\n\nThe price tag is a bit hefty for this but I guess you can say is warranted since the end result is you end up with a high quality product. This speaker sound quality definitely stands up well against my Definitive Technology speakers.

I was really on the fence about the $500 price tag but I am so happy to have purchased this system. I read a another review some where that said once you buy one of these your only regret will be not having more. After just one day of ownership I am already contemplating my next Sonos purchase. I don't usually use profanity but this is system that will make you swear at just how wonderful the music sounds.

The cool thing is that it is not device-specific, so I can set it to play Pandora with my phone, and then change the station or volume with my iPad, without skipping a beat. These also have controls directly on the speaker that allow you to adjust volume and pause music without having to use your device. Sonos also has an automatic equalizer that uses your device's microphone to test how the speaker sounds in the room and make adjustments so it sounds its best no matter what room it is in. The Sonos 5 is the flagship of the individual speakers, and has excellent bass response and dynamic range for such a small speaker. I wish they made this in an outdoor version because they are every bit as good as the Bose outdoor speakers but without the hassle of speaker wiring.."},{"reviewerName":"Charles","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"No audio from computer; much better in pairs","reviewDate":"October 21, 2016","reviewText":"I basically happy with the Sonos, but it has some problems:\n\n1. It won't stream audio from the computer. Why can't it play my audio from Youtube? Even a $30 bluetooth speaker can do that. Sonos is essentially a software company, so why don't they fix the problem. The Sonos would be far more useful if I could watch Youtube or a movie on my computer and get the audio on larger speakers.\n\n2. The sound is ok but it won't compete with a real stereo. I would not want the Sonos as my only music system. It's convenient, but a good set of stereo speakers, amp, preamp, and DAC will stomp it. I you really like good sound, you'll want a better system. Sure, the Sonos has a \"full and rich\" Bose type of sound, but the serious detail and timbre are missing. It's pleasing for what it is, however. If you want to get a lot better sound quality for the price of a pair of Sonos 5's, check out the \"Cheap and Cheerful\" forum on AudioCircle.\n\n3. It's about 10x better when you get a pair. I first just bought one Sonos 5 for various internet radio stations and casual Apple Music streaming (to check out new music). After adding a second Sonos 5, the difference is astounding. Sure, I knew I wasn't getting stereo before, but the difference is much much more significant than that. Even a mono news program like BBC World is significantly better with 2 Sonos speakers.\n\n4. The \"TruePlay\" tuning feature is useless. It's obvious that it is not sophisticated. It only allows for subtle and meaningless adjustments and it sounds better turned off. I've tried it a few times, and it tends to muffle the high frequencies slightly. This might be an improvement to the measured sound, but turning on the digital filter that TruePlay uses muffles details across the spectrum which more than negates the tiny tiny adjustment of frequency response. Just turn off TruePlay and \"Loudness\" and you'll get the least adulterated sound."},{"reviewerName":"jm2","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Wireless speakers!","reviewDate":"January 24, 2016","reviewText":"Awesome performance.

It can almost keep up with the combined Sonos TV Bar/Sub I have upstairs. You can tell Sonos put a lot effort into every detail of this thing. The speaker looks and feels great, has little rubbery bumps on three of its sides so that you can stand it up any way you want. The three buttons on top handle volume up, volume down, play/pause, next song, and previous song. The last two are accomplished by swiping your finger across all three buttons. Its even smart enough to know what orientation its in so that volume up is always the button thats on top, and volume down the button on the bottom.

It's all controlled via an Android or iPhone/IPad app. There is also a PC/MAC program but it's easier to use the phone. There is no screen and very limited controls on the speaker itself.\n\nWith the app (or program) you can choose local or steaming music, create playlists, etc. Unlike a Bluetooth speaker, the app is just controlling what the speaker is playing. It's not the source of the music. The speaker is connected to you router via Wi-Fi (Or wired) so it get the music it's playing directly over the network.\n\nThe idea of Sonos is you have a speaker in every room. But you just need one to start. Eventually you can have many speakers and they can be playing different music or all linked together playing the same thing.\n\nWhy I bought it\n\nI had a CD changer, surround sound receiver and some speakers which worked for many years. I found I wanted to modernize to something easier after my friend let me try his Sonos system.\n\nOnce I saw what this could do, I knew I could:\n\n- Listen to my almost 350 CD collection\n- Be able to create playlists from my existing collection\n- Access my purchased music collection (Amazon music and some iTunes tracks) (Was hoping this was possible)\n- Stream radio and use services like Spotify/Pandora\n- Start playing and change music easily\n\nMy CD collection\n\nOne thing Sonos does not tell you how to do is get your CD collection into the Sonos system. You can rip your CDs using some program and store them on you computer. But if you have a laptop like me sometimes it's not always available. I ended up using a microJukebox which ripped the CDs automatically. It acts as a computer server and allows me to play my music at any time. I also was able to load my existing tracks from iTunes and Amazon on it. Sonos has a nice interface like iTunes but again if your laptop is not powered on, it won't work. Now all my CDs and music are in stored on the microJukebox.\n\nHow does it sound?\n\nI was going to purchase the old version of the PLAY:5 but waited after I read that the new version was almost out. I'm glad I waited. The sound is pretty amazing. My original system has good size speakers and a small sub woofer; and the PLAY:5 fills the room with rich sound just as well is not better then the larger system.\n\nAudio quality\n\nI have been doing some listening tests between my ripped CDs and the same tracks on Spotify. The tracks ripped from CD are defiantly much better, but Spotify has a lot more music available.\n\nThe only thing I had to compare before was playing my Android phone through a blue-tooth speaker and playing CDs on my CD player was good. Now the PLAY:5 sounds even better than my CD player did with the same tracks (ripped from my CDs).\n\nI heard that Tidal streams most of their content in CD quality. I may get a trial account and try that out with this system.\n\nWhat's next?\n\nI need to start learning the advanced functionality that Sonos has to offer. I also want to start exploring some of the other free streaming services. I was very surprised at how many stream services are included.\n\nI may purchase another smaller Sonos unit for the bedroom. I see you can set alarms and it would be cool to wake up to music. I'm very happy so far!\n\nConclusion\n\nThe PLAY:5 is a great system.\n\n- Easy to use\n- Great app\n- Supports lots of different streaming services\n- Access to local music\n- Sounds amazing\n- Solidly built"},{"reviewerName":"Jarek","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Play 5 five stars well deserved","reviewDate":"March 20, 2017","reviewText":"Exceeded my expectations.

Much better sound quality than their first generation speaker. Install the Sonos app on your smart phone, plug the speaker into an outlet, and less than two minutes later, it's ready to go. We have never had any connectivity or sound problems out of any Sonos product ever. I like the soft touch fast forward, rewind, pause/play, and volume controls on the top.

You slide the two plastic latches on the side to open the box. Premium, thoughtful, apple-esque packaging. But then again, would you expect anything less from the newest flagship speaker from Sonos?\n\nSetup is simple. Plug in the power cable. Click add a new device on the mobile app. Press a button on the back of the Play:5. Chose a Music Source and boom. Music is filling your home.\n\nLooks+Feel: Understated and Stunning. I got the White with the grey screen. Heavier than I expected. New form factor is more in line with their recent design language. Also notable is the font grill which shows a serious attention to detail. The Capacitive touch panel at the top works great for volume control and track navigation. (Though most users will be controlling the Play:5 from their mobile app, nice touch none the less.)\n\nTrueplay Tuning: The Play5 has a neat little trick. It can use your mobile device as a way to automatically \"tune\" itself for the room. You enable the Trueplay setup procedure on your mobile application. The Play:5 will then begin playing a series of sounds. Follow the instructions from the mobile application and walk around the room slowly waving your mobile device. The app will tell you when it is finished and the automatic \"tuning\" will happen. Your mileage may vary here depending on the shape/size of your room and where you've placed the Play:5.\n\nSound: As one of the pioneers for streaming music, Sonos has often been (somewhat unfairly) viewed as a tech upstart. Emphasizing wireless multi-room integration/clean user experience/streaming capability over Sound quality and frequency range. And while sound quality is highly subjective, I think you'll be hard pressed to find someone not impressed with the quality from this new speaker.\n\nThe new speaker has 3 tweeters and 3 mid-woofers with a tuned class-D amplifier for each. In english, this basically means more awesome. The Play:5 has a noticeably larger and more articulate soundstage. Bass definitely improved. Sonos got rid of the Bass Port from the last generation for a fully enclosed architecture. This allowed them to get deeper and richer bass. Mids and Highs also improved and have better clarity. And don't worry...the Play:5 can get plenty loud without any distortion. You won't have any problems filling large spaces with sweet sweet music. Overall, extremely impressed.\n\nJust get the Play:5 already. Your ears will thank you. Your neighbors may not :)"},{"reviewerName":"Brian Kunst","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Five Stars","reviewDate":"March 22, 2016","reviewText":"Great product.

They cost about $140. I also have a pair of audioengine a5's that sound better, again IMO. I guess I had really high expectations because of the price and all the great reviews. To my ears it sounds like some range of frequency is gone or maybe just very quiet.\n\nI got this speaker extremely discounted so I will probably keep it, however I wouldn't pay $500 for it...or even $300.\n\nI only use Google play music so the Sonos app isn't very useful for me.\n\nI think most people would be just as happy, if not happier, with a set of decent powered speakers and a Chromecast audio.

I had researched this speaker a few weeks before it was due to hit the shelves and initial testers gave rave reviews. So i couldnt wait till it came out on the 20th!\nSo the 20th comes around and i head to Best Buy to demo the speaker. I press the play button, turn the volume up and am blown away bby the sound quality, clarity and bass! I listen to it for a few minutes on their demo song and then my decision i made. So i ask to buy and the sales rep says there is only one left! So i hurridaly tell him ill take it and i rush home elated with my purchase and eager to test it out it in te comfort of my own home!\n1. Unboxing is farily easy and upon seeing the speaker i am pleased by the aesthitics of it. Simple but beautiful. BTW, this this is heavy! Solid and well built! It comes with the power cable and an ethernet cable in case your wifi is not stable.\n2. Connecting to my wifi was a breeze! I downloaded the SONOS app on both my ipad and andriod phones. It found my wifi, i enter the password, it connects, downloads and update then i am off and running. Setup could not be easier! And for testing purposes i had this set up on my kitchen island. The SONOS app has many different music services you can connect to it which is awesome in itself.\n3. The true test. I connect my Pandora account and selected a Smooth Jazz Christmas channel and hit Play Now. What followed next made my ears melt. The easy lows, the crisp highs! Hearing every single instrument in the ensemble! My ears rejoice and i instantly feel more holiday spirit! For the size of this speaker the sound it puts out is absolutely amazing even at high levels. I turned the volume all the way up and everything was still crisp and precise. I switched to instrumental hip hop. Once again my jaw drops. Now dont except this thing to give you the bass response of a 12in subwoofer connected to an amp, but the low bass it puts out is stunning. This was proved once again when i played some dubstep on it. The bass punched my stomach and snares made my eyes tear up. Nex up, some Al Green. It felt like the man was singing right there in the room with me. Once again, i feel every note, every tone. From pianos, to sax, to bass, to vocals, highs lows and all in between, this beauty shines!\nSo just to be sure i wasnt going crazy, i invited a friend over to get his opinion on it. He put on some Michael Jackson, a song from his last album. He used the Line in to connect to his phone. The look on his face when the sound came out was priceless. As was mine. As complex as MJ's songs could be you heard everything! He listened to it for about an hour and is now going to buy two to put in stereo mode lol. He would have gone to Best Buy that night but all Best Buy's were sold out!\nSo in my conclusion, if you are on the fence about this speaker because of the price i do understand. But believe me, after bringing it home and giving it a test run i can say this is not going back. Purchase it and give it a try. I can guarantee you will not be disappointed! Across every realm of music i tried i had nothing but a smile on my face. Oh! We even tried a movie on it as well played through my Plex app connected to Line in and the clarity was also amazing!"},{"reviewerName":"Michita","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"LOVE","reviewDate":"June 7, 2016","reviewText":"Amazing sound.

Clearly the life expectancy of this speaker is 2 years. Pretty poor customer service to essentially just tell you tough luck purchase a new one. The kicker is that they mentioned that if i had consistent issues with the speaker then they would be able to do something for me. Really? If I had consistent issues with your product?

I had also been eyeing a Sonos for a while, so it just made sense to me to finally get one.\n\nWhen I opened the box I was in for a surprise. I did not expect it to be so large—it absolutely looks a lot smaller in photos. I was taken back by it at first, but I'm warming up to its size because it just feels so solid and premium, and so I expected the sound to come out of it to be nothing less than amazing. Setup was a breeze. Probably took all of two minutes for the app to detect my wifi and automatically attach itself to it. Then I had to set up Trueplay, which took another minute. From there, I set up my music service, Apple Music, and began playing \"Gravity\" by Parker & Hanson. My jaw dropped after about ten seconds because the sound that came out of it is so rich, so pure, so true—I had never heard my music in such a way before. The sound, again for lack of a better word, felt \"real\" and I can felt the music vibrate in my body, which was unusual.

I have bought over 40 speakers for all of my houses and businesses. It has always been a little risky since you can only use these speakers with their software. For some unknown reason, they changed their entire format. The new software does not allow you to add new speakers, listen to your own music, or add new music services, or just about anything. They must have had a change in management, but they ruined a perfectly good business model. The software is riddled with bugs. and comes in and out. I can tell you this with confidence since I have 10 different system setups, and literally none of them are working anymore. I am stuck with $20,000 worth of speakers that do not work anymore.

And it always seems to stop working just hours before you have a party, with lots of friends over and no ability to use your expensive wireless speakers that sound so great, well, if they were working right now... Since they are a very proprietary system, you are totally at the mercy of Sonos. If they don’t support them, you have $2,500 of useless plastic and electronic boards that do absolutely nothing. Excellent sounding speakers that don’t make any sound at all. And why did it stop working? Because you got a defective item? No. Just... because.

Setting it up was a little challenging although reasonable. Adding/activating sources/services was fairly easy as well. I have added units after the Sonos 5 and that was fairly easy as well. The sound is really good. Much better than most Bluetooth units.\n\nMy issue comes when the units or Controller software need to be updated. You cannot use the system (any of the units) until they are all and the controller application are updated. After some controller updates the system needs to be reconfigured. There is no opting out of updates.\nRomantic time? Guests came over and want set background music? Kid wants to show you a dance they came up with in their room? Need to wait (and babysit) up to 10 minutes for each each unit to update if it is successful as well as the controller application. One fails as they often do, repeat.\n\nWhich brings me to my negative review. It was during one of these updates this three months ago that my units continuously failed to update and were unusable. Each time it failed, I would send a Diagnostic as requested in the failed updated. Never heard a response.

Johnston","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Can’t Beat a Traditional System, But it’s Close (-ish)","reviewDate":"October 19, 2019","reviewText":"OVERVIEW:\nThis review is more specifically geared toward SOUND QUALITY for potential buyers who are curious to learn how the Sonos Play 5 stacks up against a more traditional home stereo system of comparable cost. While I’ve owned a few other Sonos products (Play 1 and 3)—having found the simplicity and reliability of connectivity to be stellar and integration with iPhones/iPads as seamless as if it were an Apple product itself—I’ll leave these areas to other reviewers, though I imagine the Play 5 will perform as well as the rest of the stellar product line.\n\nThere are a few videos available that compare the Sonos Play 5 speakers to more traditional speakers for those who prefer their own ears to the subjective opinion of this reviewer (those serious about evaluating the tonal difference should at least use a decent pair of headphones or speakers). However, I do try to remain as unbiased and open-minded when writing these types of reviews.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nFor reference: in terms of both equipment owned and discernment of quality audio, I’m fairly close to being an audiophile. At the same time, audiophiles and their tendency to focus on how music SOUNDS vs how it makes you FEEL is a philosophy (or tendency) I don’t align with. So, if you appreciate the audio quality of a CD, but can healthily accept that a quality MP3 (320kbps) can approximate 95% of the tonal quality and nuances in 99% of listening situations, this is the review for you.\n\nAUDIO QUALITY:\nFor 96% of listeners — those who aren’t concerned with (at least) adjusting their streaming quality to 320kbps and those seeking convenience, volume, and decent bass —the Sonos are going to sound fantastic! And considering the relatively affordable price tag and zero hassle with wires and ‘ugly’ black receivers, it’s hard to beat their simplicity and quality... especially since the Sonos 5 is likely to sound better than whatever audio equipment the majority of households are currently using (particularly if that consists of a portable Bluetooth speaker or those little “B” brand cubes).\n\nI’d confidently recommend the Sonos 5 for those seeking a “big” sound, and for those who aren’t needlessly obsessed with things like frequency response, sensitivity ratings, or DAC’s.\n\nIf it wasn’t for a side-by-side comparison against both a cost-comparable traditional stereo system (and an “audiophile”-ish one), at least half of the remaining 4% would give the Sonos 5 top marks.\n\nBUT, for more discerning listeners, a pair of Sonos 5 don’t (and cannot) compete with a dedicated receiver and bookshelf speakers of relatively equal cost. You’re always gonna lose sound quality when trying to stuff an amplifier, power supply, and additional electronics into the same box that’s meant to project sound.\n\nAfter purchasing a pair of Sonos 5, I did my own home comparison against B&W 685’s (S1) and an entry-level Marantz 7.1 channel received — combined, these retail for roughly the same cost AND come with Apple Airplay built into the receiver... so same streaming functionality. I also compared these against B&W CM6 (S2’s) with an Anthem MRX 720 — which, combined, retails at roughly 4x the cost of a pair of Play 5’s. To be frank, while the Sonos DID sound absolutely rich and satisfying, capable of filling my entire 18x23’ family room with full, bass-heavy audio (capable of dance-party-level decibels), BOTH wired systems were on a whole other level. In fact, the difference between the $1K system and $4K wired systems was much smaller than the difference between the $1K system and the Sonos.\n\nEven the cost-comparable system offered far clearer separation of instruments and vocals — especially in the midrange. The midrange on the Sonos sounded a bit flat and compressed while the treble felt slightly muted at the highest of frequencies (8-12kHz). The soundstages were also significantly more expansive. The Sonos sounded like a speaker playing the music while the B&W speakers sounded like the music recording, if that makes sense. Close your eyes sitting dead center on any well-balanced system (correct height, distance, etc) and you can’t place the speakers... you CAN place the instruments in the three dimensional soundstage quality speakers give you. The higher quality the speakers, receiver, recording format, and DAC (digital-analogue converter—a $3-15 part integrated into everything that plays digital music), the more Detailed and refined the soundstage.\n\nThe Play 5’s sounded good, great even. They did not sound accurate, detailed, or anywhere near as refined as a dedicated set of bookshelf speakers and integrated amp (or HT receiver). The Sonos did offer more noticeable mid to upper bass (particularly in the 80-100hz range), though it seemed to be the result of tweaking the internal crossovers around 90hz to give the impression of “fuller” bass; not bad, just not accurate reproduction and touch too boomy for my taste. I prefer a slightly pronounced low end, but in the 40-60Hz range, the deeper, punchier bass you feel, not hear. Both wired systems had more noticeable lower-end bass reproduction, particularly at higher volumes.\n\nSo for the remaining 2%, those interested in not only hearing and feeling the music but ‘listening’ to it — the actual recording, the placement of instruments, etc — it’s pretty clear what that extra equipment, wires, and extra $$ is getting you...\n\nFEATURES:\nTrouble is, there’s no fine-tuning any audio parameters with the Play 5’s except thru your phone’s crummy EQ (or worse, your streaming player’s lame 5-band equalizer). This is partly where having a dedicated receiver really shines. While it does cost you some space and possibly some aesthetics (wires, etc), you have a wealth of functionality and customization options, particularly if you want to incorporate TV or Film.\nAnd if/when the tech changes, you’re out the entire system whereas dedicated speakers can last for a solid 15+ years. My Sonos Play 1 is already dated as it doesn’t have Airplay and can’t play music stored in my phone :/\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\nIf convenience and simplicity are your thing, Sonos 5 won’t disappoint. They’re clean, they’re cool, they’re fairly attractive (though I prefer grill-free speakers), they sound great, get loud, and best of all... there’s ONE plug. Easy.\n\nIf you’re someone who nitpicks over sound quality or someone looking for a longer term solution (as well as a MUCH greater resell value), spend roughly the same $ on a solid bookshelf speakers (Klipsch, B&W, KEF, Monitor Audio, etc) and an integrated amplifier (NAD, Marantz, Peachtree, Rotel) with AirPlay or Play-Fi. And if you’re on a budget but ALSO want small and convenient, try something like a used NAD D3020 amp (the size of a modem), compact bookshelf speakers that put out bigger bass (klipsch/BW), and a used Apple Airport Express (if you want to utilize AirPlay with any non-connected amp). All in... $700 (used) and you’ve got a higher quality sound system that uses no additional space, provides slightly more functionality, and yields noticeable higher audio quality— for those who even notice this stuff—all for less than a pair of Sonos 5’s.\n\nIf I could do it all over again, I’d still invest in separates. If I could do it all over again and I DIDN’T also watch a lot of movies and DIDN’T already hear the higher-end system, I’d get the wire/connection-free PLAY 5’a!\n\nHope this helps!"},{"reviewerName":"Nathan S.

Look... This system depends on a strong WiFi signal to work properly. If you are stealing your neighbor's signal or don't have the patience to ensure that the system is set to a separate channel to prevent interference this just isn't the right speaker or system for you. Also, this is not a Bluetooth speaker. While Sonos has recently added the option to play music straight from the Spotify app on your phone or tablet this does not happen via Bluetooth and any other content you play on this speaker that is not a line in source will have to be played through the Sonos controller app (yes, this includes you iTunes fans.) The app is admittedly not the most attractive piece of software but is under constant development. Again, if you don't have the patience to learn how to reboot the system to refresh things now and then after an app update, this is not the right speaker for you. I have had my system for about 2 years and the only issues that I have had to troubleshoot were accounted for with corresponding wifi or router issues that were not any fault of the sonos system. The sound quality is amazing, and customizable. The system makes it very easy to add new components at any time ensuring that this system will grow and expand as needed with little effort. I don't regret a single penny that I've spent on this system and when the room I'm working on is finished I will happily be adding to it. The bottom line, this system best serves the tech enthusiast and if you have the patience care for it, it will be a stellar addition to your home."},{"reviewerName":"Hank","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"iOS glitch","reviewDate":"The manufacturer commented on the review below","reviewText":"phone support hours don't favor west coast people.

Using Spotify you have to use the Sonos' version within the Sonos app which translates into frustration when selecting music. The audio drops occurred at random using my Apple router (AirPort Extreme current gen). I either had to spend more $ to get a wifi bridge or hardwire a speaker to the router. My location was not convenient to run an ethernet cable and I wasn't going to spend more $ for a system that should work over my wifi network as advertised. I also didn't like that there was a delay to the audio when using the aux input. Sonos should provide a software switch on how to use the aux input to eliminate the delay when you are not going to broadcast the aux input to other speakers.\n\nOverall I found the product to not function as advertised due to audio drops where my $35 alternative works flawlessly... even in multiroom environments.

Sonos does not follow that model. If you own Sonos equipment, you have to worry not only about the performance of the equipment -- which is unpredictable -- but you must also take into account that the people at Sonos might change their mind about how they prefer their equipment to work.\n\nI have spent thousands of dollars on my Sonos system, and many more thousands on a music library that I own. However, Sonos notified me that with the next update these two investments of mine will no longer be compatible. In other words, I will not be able to play back any music stored locally on my devices.\n\nOf course, I will be able to play my own music if I spend more money on additional Sonos products (a lot more) or start paying for a premium streaming service every month and download my entire library to it. But to be forced into this decision based on the whims of the people at Sonos does not make for satisfied customers when they have already spent as much money as I have.\n\nIt took nearly two years of dealing with technical issues getting all of my Sonos speakers to consistently cooperate. I have finally been able to enjoy my own music library hassle-free for the last several months. Looks like that will be all I get to enjoy.\n\nI have nothing but regret for buying these speakers.

This is because at the time the Sonos software worked well with the hardware. So very frustrated as I now have a system that may or may not work on a given day.

The Sonos App is pretty lousy. It seems like it is always either crashing, not installing a music service correctly (I've never been able to add Soundcloud), or in some way just being very hard to organize my music. You cannot access Spotify playlists belonging to Spotify users, for instance.\n\nIn addition, Sonos very intentionally does not allow you to make ANY changes to the speaker without Wifi, and the wifi set up process is often painful. If you want to set the Sonos to line-in, you need to do so on Wifi - otherwise the app will not even OPEN.\n\nOverall, pretty nice speaker, but terrible company. Maybe its just my overreaction but it feels like a company that is truly greedy, and is not ashamed in not hiding it.

Until today, I thought the Play 1 was the most musical of the Sonos speakers---it has a nice flat response to a streaming music file, and it doesn't color the mid-range with a somewhat dark or muddied sound as the gen 1 PLay 5 speaker seems to do for my ears. However, I heard a demo of the new generation Play 5 this past week at a local audio shop, and I immediately heard a much more transparent sound image for the music that was being demo'd (re-mastered Beatle tracks, Dave Brubeck jazz quartet, Adele 25 tracks). I went ahead and upgraded my living room today, replacing a pair of gen 1 Play 5's with a pair of gen 2 PLay 5's. I am VERY HAPPY with the improved sound transparency, much improved sound stage imaging, and the sonic range of the new, paired speakers. IMO, this speaker is a big improvement over the previous Play 5. I suspect that I will be able to continue to tweak the exact placement of my new Play 5's in my living room to further refine the sound stage imaging.\n\nAn added bonus: Sonos speakers tend to hold their value quite well on the used market, if you take good care of the speaker. I was able to sell my four year old Play 5's at a good price (about 25% less than I paid for them), so it was not that hard to justify the upgrade costs for the new PLay 5 speakers."},{"reviewerName":"R.

There is some painful distortion in the upper mid-range / lower high range which creeps in near maximum volume.\n\nThe play:5 matches the quality of conventional speakers in the $600-$800/pair range. When you consider that the amplifiers are included and the extreme convenience of the streaming software it is a pretty good value. If you are an audiophile, you are better off getting the Sonos connect:amp and adding a sub.\n\nOne great convenience of the Sonos system is that you can add units over time and still get full functionality because of the long production runs of each unit. We've added speakers over a few years, singly or in pairs to avoid large cash outlays and as we reconfigure rooms.\n\nPros:\nExcellent sound and convenience\n3.5mm mini-plug audio input (for bluetooth adapter, PC input, etc.)\nPlays fairly loud without distortion\nGood bass for regular music listening.\nWireless (2.4 Ghz) or wired Ethernet input\nVertical or Horizontal Orientation\nAdd units over time. Even a single play:5 is very functional. A pair is a lot better.\nAny input can play on any speaker, or group of speakers.\n\nCons:\nWon't play loud enough for a DJ-style party\nBookshelf speaker sized, 14 lbs.\nRequires AC, somewhat limiting placement.\nOptional Sub does not rock the house\nDistortion creeps in at high volumes\n\nIMO the sub is unnecessary for music. The play:1 is good for smaller rooms or if you don't play music very loudly."},{"reviewerName":"Robert Shockey","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Buggy software, terrible support, prepare to be disappointed.","reviewDate":"May 11, 2019","reviewText":"I’ve had a Sonos 5 for a couple of years now. At first, it was great, never a problem. Then Sonos started monkeying with the software, and it all went downhill fast. Don’t get me wrong, their software needed updating badly — it was not very good. But now, when I listen to Sirius XM channels, the speaker starts skipping randomly through the cache, jumping back and forth through the program. Then Sonos added a feature where you can play songs from your phone. Great! Except a song will be playing when it suddenly stops as if it has ended — only the song has not ended, it’s just skipped to the next track. I looked it up, and the Sirius problem is definitely widely reported, yet Sonos played the old tech support game of pretending like I was the only person who had ever had this problem. They asked me to go through an incredibly complicated process to send them logs, which I was not able to figure out. Then, they told me that a new release was coming soon, and hinted that it would fix this problem. That was a year ago, and it’s still having the same problem. I’m about done. I think I’ll get an Amazon device, even though the sound will suffer and the government will probably be listening to me through it."},{"reviewerName":"Nicholas Cook-Rostie","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Neighbors are already complaining","reviewDate":"November 24, 2015","reviewText":"I had the older model Play:5 and it stopped working, and I am glad it did when it did, so that I bought this new model instead of purchasing another gen 1 Play:5. The sound quality on this thing is amazing. I also own two play 1's, playbar, and sub that I compare it to. I am excited to for when the a new playbar comes out because I am not impressed with the sound quality from the playbar, as this new play 5 can produce better sound. It produce s more than enough bass to fill my 600 sq ft bedrom, big improvement from the older play5 on this aspect. The bass is much more pronounced at lower volumes too, whereas the older play5 sounded flat at lower volumes. Lastly, the look is much improved over the old play5 and it allows for it to be positioned in different configurations and to be mounted. I Had to drive an hour to get it and got the last one at any best but in Minnesota till next week. It is worth the $100 increase over the old play5 and it is worth every penny of its rather outrageous price tag. Already dreaming about being able to stereo pairing this up with another play5; might have to treat myself if I can get a 4.0 this semester.

When it works, it's brilliant. Unfortunately, there are still some software issues.\n\nFor the first months I owned these, I had problems with the controller (mostly my iPhone) losing the connection with the speakers. Sometimes, I could not connect. At other times, I would have music playing, but I could not connect to stop the music, so I had to unplug the speakers to get them to stop playing.\n\nThe solution to every problem seemed to be to unplug the speakers, power down the Internet router, power everything back up in reverse order, and hope for the best. That usually worked, but sometimes more than one try was required to get everything working. When I just wanted to hear some music, this wasn't how I wanted to spend my time.\n\nSonos technical support seemed to think it was a problem with my router.\n\nThen after a software update from Sonos, I had several months of trouble-free operation. I was delighted. I could pause the music, and if I was away for a week, when I reconnected, it would pick up mid-song exactly where I left off. It seemed they had solved their software problems.\n\nI recently accepted the most recent software update from Sonos. Yes, I ignored the adage, \"If it ain't broke don't fix it.\" Unfortunately, things are back to the earlier state or even worse. If I want to listen to music, I expect that the Sonos system won't be found. I will spend 30 minutes or so restarting everything\n\nA day does not go by now without problems. I come home and want to listen to music while I cook dinner, and I am confronted with not being able to connect to the speakers. It's bad enough that I don't expect it to work now. Some days, I just give up and listen to music on Amazon Echo. Sound quality is not nearly as good as the Sonos, but at least it works reliably.\n\nMakes me sad. It's a product with great potential, but you may not get simple, fuss-free operation.\n\nI'm updating and revising this review upward. After my initial review, I decided to give a Sonos Boost a try, figuring that getting some of the Sonos traffic off my \"main\" wireless network might help. Sonos technical support did not seem optimistic that this would solve my problem, but for $99, I figured it was worth a shot. I hooked up the Boost and switched my speakers to use it (easy!). My \"main\" WiFi is configured for channel 11, so I set the Boost to channel 1.\n\nIt's been over a month since I did that, and I have experienced no subsequent problems with the Play 5's.\n\nI'm not completely sure my problems are gone, since I had over six months of trouble-free operation last year, but I'm keeping my fingers crossed."},{"reviewerName":"Mayra S.","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Beware of faulty Wifi and need to exchange through Sonos, Excellent Speaker otherwise and worth the upgrade from Gen 1","reviewDate":"March 20, 2017","reviewText":"As a Sonos owner for a few years now (two Play 3, one Play 5, one Play 5 gen:2, and the soundbar for a short while), I have been impressed and have used my Sonos sound system enough times to know that they are well built. Reading the many reviews on the new Gen 2, I decided to take the financial plunge and purchased mine in December of 2016. Overall, it is everything I read it was compared to the Gen 1. The Gen 1 is still a great speaker, but in terms of filling my living room with music which is where my Gen 1 was placed before, the Gen 2 sounds louder, music sounds better, and the base makes me doubt I will ever need a standalone Sonos Bass. In fact, since I live in a condo I've turned down the loudness setting and some of the bass as well. Even taking away the bass, I enjoy the richness in the music more than I do with my Gen 1. So for 3 months, everything was great. I use my system at least 5 times a week, each time for 1-3 hours. Especially now with the music controller integration onto my apple watch now that I don't need to carry my phone to change tracks or control volume. I've never had an issue with my other 3 year old speakers, then all of a sudden my new 2 month old Play:5 fell off of my Sonos system. Odd, but I managed to add the speaker again. Then early in early March, the speaker fell of the system again and I was unable to reconnect wirelessly no matter what I tried. It did still work however when connected to an ethernet cable, but that's not how I meant to have my Sonos system connected in the first place. After some time and research, it turns out that there are a number of Play:5 Gen 2's with faulty wireless chips/cards which makes them fall off of wireless systems periodically, or permanently. I called Sonos, and without saying anything, the Sonos tech politely walked me through different troubleshooting steps, until finally 30 min later he stated the same thing, that there have been a number of wireless malfunctions with some of the newer Play 5's. Since the speakers have to register with Sonos when you use them for the first time, the rep knew that mine was less than a year old, and set up an exchange which was painless. I used the same box I received my new Sonos to ship the faulty one back, and so far no issues with my new Speaker. So if you do buy this speaker, understand that it is an excellent sounding speaker, but be aware and ready to call customer service if you experience any sort of Wifi drop. I did not deduct any stars from the review because Sonos customer service was friendly, polite, and made the exchange painless, and they did confirm that the replacement speaker comes with a new 1 year warranty from the shipment date."},{"reviewerName":"CB","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Mostly excellent speaker","reviewDate":"May 9, 2018","reviewText":"I picked up my first wireless speaker, a play:1, during a black friday sale and in less than a year decided to upgrade to a play:5 during a Sonos anniversary sale. The play:1 rebate was immediate but the play:5 was a rebate after purchase. Sonos provided the rebate only as a wire transfer (not ACH) which caused a $15 fee from my bank. Sonos eventually got that straight by refunding me even more money.\n\nI use the Sonos in the kitchen. I placed the play:1 on top of my refrigerator as it sounded boomy on the countertop (and I wanted it out of the way). It sounded better at ear height. I wanted to upgrade to get a fuller sound, with more bass, and more stereo separation. The play:1 has only one, universal driver while the play:5 has 6 independent drivers. The play:5 is contoured and probably meant to rest below hear height, like on a countertop. Since the drivers face upward, I had to adjust the cabinet so while on top of the refrigerator the drivers faced forward (or even slightly down). It took rubber feet almost 0.5” tall to reach proper adjustment.\n\nI like the sound of the play:5. It certainly is a fuller sound than the play:1 that fills the kitchen regardless of your location. I find it stops playing infrequently when the microwave is in use. The play:1 never did this. I’ve tried different wi-fi frequencies but the issue persists. One other irritating issue is that you can start and stop music from your own collection (on my PC’s hard drive) by simply touching the button on top.

I have been clean zero days. Let me tell you about Play 5. If you buy this speaker, you will love it. You will be so, so happy with the quality of sound, and you will feel it was worth the money. If you are going to buy just one SONOS, get the Play 5 for sure. HOWEVER, I must warn you that if you buy a second SONOS speaker, you will become an addict. When you plug a second SONOS in for the first time, you realize you must have more and more. These speakers communicate with each other, so for example, if you have two Play 5s in one room, they will not be playing the exact same sounds. They work together to bring a richness to music that you did not ever know was possible. The sound quality of movies is that of a theater. If you like shooter games, you will hear the enemy coming up behind you, from the direction they are coming from. These speakers are SIIIIIICK. As a bonus, when your friends come over, they can instantly change the music to their own playlist on their own phone, or everyone in the room can stack the songs they want to play into the queue like a jukebox.\n\nI now own two Play 5s, two Play 1s, two sub-woofers, and the sound bar. I recommend not having neighbors who live close by if you become addicted. You may need to move so you can fully appreciate your sound system and shake your home to its very foundation.

As far as sound goes, they are decent, but not great for that amount of money. There are wired speakers in that price range that will do a lot better. That said, the wireless environment is pretty much the only way for me to go at this point, and I enjoy these speakers quite a bit, but I have had to adjust my expectations.

The setup was very easy and I put them vertically about 15 Feet aqwy from each other. I was concerned because it's in my living room with a large open kitchen and a some 30 feet long walls. So basically because it's vertical the Sonos adjusts itself to vertical mode and I have an amazing clear sound with both high, mid and lows at a perfect range. Now, don't get upset if it doesn't have the high and lows at the beginning. It's because the default settings suppress the lows and highs. I find out that when you go to the App and go to Settings and to the \"Room\" and to \"Speaker\" and to \"EQ\" (Equalizer) , you then can control the highs and the lows. I had to go through a few songs in different styles until I settled on a high that was just right (higher than the default) and on the bass that was just right (also higher than eventually got it to where I just loved it and all the tones were natural and not metallic or too vibrating. I just love the sound. Couldn't have been better. The only way they got such great sound is the internal amplifiers. I have to mention that the vertical setting gives an amazing sweet spot with perfect natural stereo and if it's horizontal the spot spreads wider and fills the house better if you are in a large house. In my case I just want it to be perfect on my couch and I will get smaller units for the kitchen and other rooms. I can now see why people are buying more units. It's just so beautiful and an improvement in quality of life. Thanks to Sonos who decided to make the best quality and the most intuitive system on the market. I had a few concerns about he L shape of my living room and about the fact that I don't connect any of them directly to the router but this system has no problem to be 20 plus feet away from the router.

The sound stays crisp and clear, even when the volume is allllll the way up.

Youtube is incompatible for wireless use with Sonos speakers, and Sonos has no intention on making their speakers Youtube-compatible. The PLAY 5 does have a Line-In option though that allows you to connect your phone/tablet/mp3/pc/etc to the speaker via auxiliary cord and play whatever you want that way. It's annoying that it cannot be done wirelessly, but at least it has this option.\n\n--Not very portable. Power must be supplied via electrical outlet, and it's a bit heavy.\n\n--Power supply cord does not latch on to the speaker tightly and thus can easily be disconnected if you touch the cord or move the speaker.\n\n--Connecting to a wireless network can be frustrating. The first-time set up should go smoothly; Sonos has an app that walks you through the entire process.

I'm not a Networking guru, so maybe a simpler way exists, but I could not find one that actually worked. Anyway, here's directions from the Sonos website on how to factory reset a PLAY 5, should you need them:\n\n\"What is the difference between factory resetting or rebooting a Sonos player?\n\nFactory resetting and simply rebooting your Sonos player or product are very different things. Factory resetting your Sonos player will completely wipe any stored information from the player, where as rebooting the Sonos player just powers it off and on while preserving the data.\n\nFactory resetting is typically done when you are transferring ownership of the player or want to register the player to a different email address. Rebooting the player is done if you've replaced your router or move a player from one location in your home to another.\n\nHow to reboot your Sonos player\n\nTo reboot a Sonos player:\n\nSimply remove the power cord from the wall outlet or from the back or bottom of the Sonos player.\nWait about 10 seconds for the unit to completely power off and then plug the player back in.\nAllow 1 minute for the player to boot back up.\nIf the player was previously setup, it should automatically rejoin when the boot sequence is complete.\n\nHow to factory reset your Sonos player\n\nFactory resetting is most commonly used when it is necessary to register the Sonos system to a different email address or to completely wipe all saved data from a player, such as music services, Sonos playlists, and music library shares. This information cannot be restored.\n\nUnplug the power cord from the electrical wall outlet.\nPress and hold the Connect button while simultaneously plugging the power cord back into the electrical wall outlet.\nContinue holding the Connect button until the light begins flashing amber and white.\nOnce reset, the light will flash green, indicating the product has been reset and can be added back to your Sonos household.\""},{"reviewerName":"Stoney Rockwell","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Persistent Wifi interference and connection issues - don't buy!","reviewDate":"October 6, 2018","reviewText":"I started with Sonos in 2013, now have 11 speakers, but totally exasperated by horrible connection issues.

The clarity and richness of the sound is truly amazing. I will say that you will have to be a bit of an audiophile to appreciate it, so if you’re the type of person who thinks $20 headphones are sufficient, you will not appreciate this speaker. However, if you’re the type of person who has spent $200 on headphones just for sound quality, this speaker is what you have been missing. All types of music sound fantastic from calming piano, to upbeat country, to seriously loud club style music.\nTake the extra minute to preform the Trueplay tuning (iPhone only, so android users miss out here) and you will instantly love this speaker.\nMy only warning to everyone is if you start by purchasing one Sonos product, you’ll instantly be hooked and will end up spending $1,500-$2,000 on your whole home audio set up. So if you can afford to spend serious money on speakers, this is probably the one to start with. This unit has plenty of bass alone, but if you pair it with the Sonos SUB, you will have a hard time finding anything that sounds better.

Yes, for more money, there are better \"traditional\" speakers, BUT the convenience of streaming and managing music from a single app, to each room in the house, is more important especially when the audio is this good. I think a single Sonos 5 would work well in a mid-sized room, but it won't have the channel separation of two separate 5s even though the 5 is a stereo speaker.\n\nI'm new to Sonos, and wireless household streaming, so the great audio quality takes a second place to the convenience of the controller app (on my smartphone, and MacBook Pro). The free controller app works well. I am able to stream, and control, music from my iTunes library, Amazon Music Unlimited (or most other services), and Tunein Radio, from one single app. The app also allows me to make app-based playlists, with tracks from my library, as well as Amazon or any other subscription service. Kind of a \"best-of\" playlist with tracks from various sources. I also stream classical concerts from around the world with the built-in Tunein Radio service. It offers every station world-wide (and it let's you add a different higher-bitrate streaming URL for a station if it is available). Very happy I took the leap to wi-fi streaming with Sonos.....only wish the audio could also be played back via headphones on the phone and Mac."},{"reviewerName":"Techie Monster","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Update broke system; Customer service is nice, but doesn't help at all.","reviewDate":"November 5, 2016","reviewText":"Was awesome.

I spent hours going through the Sonos support pages trying to add my own music library, but the system is simply not intended to be used that way. Your only option with this is to pay a monthly fee for a streaming service—or the free Pandora service with loud commercials. If that is all you want, then this will be great.

If you are not careful you could end up with streams \"open\" (even if not playing) on both and the dot and the Sonos. And since each are considered separate devices that count towards your max number of your Amazon music accounts, Alexa will tell you to turn one off.

The Sonos software is very functional. Its easy to listen directly to thousands of streaming radio stations and and all the major music services, though the Sonos software is not quite as slick as the speaker.

We've had the original pieces of the system since 2013, and have occasionally added Play 1s.\nI highly prefer a pair of Play 1 speakers over the Play 5 Gen 1 we have. They seem much more natural and full. The Play 5 tends to boom and resonate such that I think I'd need a quality narrowband EQ to get the desired performance. In addition, the physical separation available with two Play 1s gives stereo separation that the Play 5 cannot have.\nAll that said, we've been happy enough with the Play 5 until last week. When we unplugged the Play 5 to move it to a different room, it could not be located by the Sonos controller, and the LED flashed white about every 5 seconds indefinitely. Yep, another Play 5 failure. Tried all the suggestions on the support community pages and then waited my half hour for the Sonos help desk, running diagnostics while I waited. Of course, the help desk tech eventually diagnosed a failed unit and offered the 30% off. I do not feel the Play 5 is worth $349, let alone $499. I will not be buying another Play 5. Further, with my almost 40 year old Denon audio stack still running perfectly, and the Sonos system starting to fail in less than 6 years (good compared to some of your very early failures), I am questioning my overall investment in Sonos."},{"reviewerName":"Colin McGraw","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Best Speaker For Echo Dot?","reviewDate":"April 5, 2016","reviewText":"I love the original Amazon Echo, but am a minor audiophile and never like the sound from its speaker.\n\nThat's why I was so excited when the dot came out! It allowed the capability of an Echo, but had an aux out to attach to a better speaker.\n\nSadly, a lot of speakers nowadays (like the Harmon Kardon Aura Studio) automatically put themselves to sleep after a time, but don't wake themselves up.\n\nEnter the Play:5, which not only sounds great, with good clarity and strong bass, but also has an arguably ideal capability to not only auto-wake from line-in, but also have the smarts to switch from the Sonos app wireless play to the line-in (and back) as needed! This makes the Play:5 fit the best of both worlds, playing audio services the Echo doesn't (like songs stored on your iPhone), but also any service the Echo DOES support!\n\nIt is also a versitile part of the Sonos ecosystem, which features not only room equalization/calibration with Trueplay, but also the ability to expand into multi-speaker, or even multi-room setups!\n\nOn the downside, the speaker takes a second for auto-wake to kick in, so the first second or two of response can go missing from the Echo Dot response if you haven't used it in awhile. Additionally, there are other high-end wireless speakers that sound better (e.g. the B&W Zeppelin Wireless), but the Play:5 hit a sweet spot for me in sound quality, price and especially versatility!\n\nI like it greatly and you will too!"},{"reviewerName":"TechGuru","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"WOW.

Don't get me wrong, there are a couple songs that sounded better on the B&W, but the bass and overall clarity pushed this over the edge. And the cherry on top was that Trueplay made it sound that much better! Not to mention the Sonos app, no one comes close in this category.\n\nBottom line: Buy this, you will NOT be disappointed!

It really keeps the clarity on high volume and throws the sound around the room, amazing it comes from a small speaker. I am 100% glad I picked this....\n\nI have been looking at speakers for a while--couple of months. I upgraded TV's recently, and I had a Bose Soundbar that was \"okay\" and I was unsatisfied to the level the new TV was at.

So since I have the new TV's, great excuse to buy more stuff and move stuff around....\n\nFirst, Bose is okay but I know Bose is a reputation brand and pretty safe but there are better things out there. Before I buy more Bose stuff I wanted to see what's out there.\n\nSince I am a big Apple user, I thought what does the HomePod have to offer...I actually ended up buying one. I read a lot of the HomePod vs. Sonos Play 5 reviews and they are both good, so I figured I would try it. First,it is not nearly as smart as Alexa.

Really nice packaging, the experience of opening it was great.\n* Loaded the App, I was listening to the TV in another 5 minutes with my Apple Music all set up\n* The bass is WAAAAY awesome, it goes louder than I will use in here without feeling bad for my neighbors. The whole house feels the bass.\n* I can adjust the sound, not super sophisticated but I can customize it. HomePod, you get what you get--I didn't like that.\n* This is more than I expected sound-wise, I kind of want to buy another one for upstairs instead of moving the SoundBar up there.\n* For me, the smart speaker aspect I don't really care about.

I will start of by saying that I am a sound ENTHUSIAST but not a audiophile by any means. I was bit by the SONOS bug back in 2012 when I picked up 3 of the original 5s to setup wireless music in 3 rooms in my house. I was OK with the sound quality but not super impressed. I play 320k mp3s from my server which sound almost as great as FLAC files. I added the SONOS Sub this summer and the sound improved markedly with deep but tight bass. Yet the mids and highs were a bit \"laid back\" even after playing with the EQ settings in the SONOS app. The 5s just sounded very good with the sub, but not great. Don't get me wrong. They weren't muddy sounding by any means but the sound lacked a bit of \"presence\".\n\nI picked up 2 of the new PLAY:5s from my local big box store and the new units were totally a new experience before I even took off the 3 layers of shrink-wrap and plastic bags protecting it! Props to SONOS for the amazing and high quality packaging! You can tell SONOS took a page out of Apple's book when it came to the unboxing experience. But as they say, the proof is in the pudding. The setup was simply enough with just a push of a button on the back of the unit and using either the iOS/Android app or the desktop app to tell your system to look for the new speakers. Both new speakers were found in a minute and the app even asked if I wanted to pair them, which I happily did for my living room along with the Sub for a more immersive stereo experience.\n\nSONOS really hit the ball out of the pack with the new 5. Sonically, the mids and highs stood out as the most improved. Bass was better as well but the open ports in the back are gone now it seems so there's less boominess. I listen to a fair amount of jazz and acoustic guitar and these new speakers were far better in it's ability to clearly and boldly reproduce them as they were recorded in the studio. This might have to do with the additional drivers and the speakers being angled upwards and to the tweeters to the sides as well as forwards. I can clearly hear a wider \"soundstage\" as the music played whereas my old 5s had a more narrow presentation. The highs were clear and sparkly without being too harsh or bright where you get annoyed. The mids, important for vocals, were fuller. Bass was tighter without the Sub but deeper. But I think the system still sounds best with the sub. I don't know if it's as simple as more and better drivers or if there is a bit of audio processing happening inside the unit but it works and that's all that matters.\n\nI like the new design. I originally thought the black front grills on the white unit, which I purchased, looked out of place. The original white 5 had a white grill. But I have grown to love the new design. It looks like a high quality piece that screams high fidelity. The older unit looked a bit dated now against the new ones. The only thing I missed is the \"handle\" on the back which allowed me to take it to a new location at will with just one hand.\n\nAll in all, the updated PLAY:5 is superior to the originals and I have no regrets with my purchase. I've since moved my older speakers to other rooms and still enjoy them. But the new 5s are front and center in my living room paired with the Sub.\n\nPROS:\n\n+Superior sounding vs old 5 with clearer/cleaner mids and highs; deeper and tighter bass\n+Ability to skip tracks with just a swipe of the touch sensitive controls\n+Can be positioned vertically or horizontally with touch controls adjusting to the position desired\n+Clean and pleasing styling\n+Great packaging and protection for unit when bought new\n\nCONS:\n\n-$100 more expensive\n-No long has the carry handle in the back of unit\n-Deeper design may make it too big for smaller/shallower tables"},{"reviewerName":"Sandy Scott","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"I love this speaker","reviewDate":"November 1, 2017","reviewText":"I guess you could describe me as an audiophile.

And the songs they had on demo, really helped.\n\nThe design of the speaker is great! You can place it three ways, just make sure you don't accidentally place it upside down. Otherwise, you may end up with a scratched speaker. That leads me to the finish of the black play 5. The paint on the very top layer seems to be a matte/satin finish. Then underneath that layer, the paint seems to be a shinny finish. Then what looks to be the bottom layer is white paint, the same paint on the Sonos logo on the back of the speaker. The same matte paint and or texture applies for the grill as well.\nThis leads me to conclude that the more you clean/handle the speakers, that matte/satin finish will fade or become shinny over time. Not sure if it's a good or bad thing. You can compare it to a computer keyboard, where the keys that gets used the most will have a shine to them. The black finish is really nice, it adds a high-end/expensive look to the speaker. The only bad thing is that the black finish leaves a lot of finger prints, especially if your hands aren't clean.\n\nThe magic really happens when you create a stereo pair. Stereo separation is fantastic. There, before you lays the stage, and you're in the front row. At 8-11 feet apart, these speakers will play tricks on you. The speakers may be at your left and right,however, you're also hearing instruments and vocals coming directly center of you, but when you open your eyes, there's no one's there, no speaker either! Wow!! Soundstage! And some times it feels as if the bass and music are coming out of the air and then the speakers disappear.\nThe one song that does this exceptionally well is: The Man In The Long Black Coat by Bob Dylan. You can hear awesome stereo separation,bass,vocal, individual instruments, and best of all, a sound that will draw you in and encompass the entire environment all around you. Wow..didn't know a song can do that to you...speechless.\n\nAlso with a stereo pair, everything can get twice as loud which leads to me to believe that people may start to hate you. And for this reason, the addition of a sub may not be necessary. You're just waiting for a knock at your door, telling you to lower down your music! But if you have the need for more bass, go for it! What I heard is that the sub will add more punch to the bass, playing down to 25 hz and also further expand the listening environment or sound stage. Also, the bass itself will no longer be directional instead encompassed all around you. Just keep in mind that at high volumes, your ears will take a beating and listening at max volume will give you the after-effect of a concert. Your ears may be ringing!\n\nThe best thing that the Play 5 did for me was made me fall in love music again, and not with just my old music but with entirely new songs in completely new genres, songs I'd never thought I'd find myself listening to and enjoying over and over again. The Play 5 made me appreciate and love music, the way it was meant to be heard.\n\nOnly thing I wish Sonos would support is hi-res (come on already) other than that, this speaker is perfect! One of a kind.\n\nUpdate 03/28/2016\n\nAfter three months, these speakers sound better and better. I find that playing them in different rooms made a significant difference. I usually play in the basement so that I can crank up the volume to about 75%, however, at max volume, it gets uncomfortable. I believe that my basement isn't big enough for max volume. You'll need a really big room for max volume (with highest bit rate sample) to sound comfortable. That being said, in different rooms, the same volume will not sound the same. So in the basement, 75% sounds very loud, but in the living room, this will sound extremely loud. The sound will go right through the windows and to your neighbors.\n\nThe weather got nice enough for me to use one speaker outside on the patio. I was expecting the sound to dissipate since there's really no walls outside. However, I was completely wrong. One speaker alone filled my entire patio and onwards, all the way to the edge of my yard ( yard is about 15 yrd X 10 yrd). I was not able to set the volume pass 75% for fear that my neighbors would come out and complain. The bass sounds amazing outside, you would think that it would not be able to produce that amount of bass outside. I was able to feel bass on the patio, on the soles of my feet and hiting me directly. The new play 5 sounds great if not better outside just as it does inside. Makes commercial/business outdoors speakers sound terrible in comparison."},{"reviewerName":"Damon J","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"What I Expected!","reviewDate":"December 18, 2016","reviewText":"First off, I didn't buy my Sonos speakers on Amazon. Even though I buy everything else here. I bought one Play 5 on pcrichard. Another Play 5, and two Play 1's on Apple, as they were offering three months of Apple Music free with each purchase. Thus three separate purchases, and nine months of free music, ( which I was already subscribed to. ) Now, I've long had my eye on Sonos, and these speakers didn't disappoint. Finally pulled the trigger on this expensive system. I hear individuals say they're overrated, ( the same they say about Apple, Bose, etc.. but these are truly well supported companies, that make incredible constructed products. As are these. ) but I'm truly impressed with the separation in the music I'm playing through it. I like that it's WiFi, and can live without it being Bluetooth enabled as well, due to the sound downgrade. I do feel Sonos should loosen the reins a little, and allow more control to the user, rather than everything going through their proprietary software, which is a bit clunky. But I understand this is what most companies want these days, walled gardens. Because I'm sure they're looking for ways to somehow monetize their software. I know there are cons to these speakers, but couldn't ding them for it, as I've done my research, and knew well before hand, what I wasn't getting. I'm not an audiophile, but know what sounds good to me. And this, sounds great! Trueplay tuning is definitely not a gimmick, as I definitely hear a difference in post tuned, as opposed to pre-tuned. I have them in a bookshelf, and they sounded good and loud when I first turned them on, but totally evened out after Trueplay. I know, no Bluetooth, ( don't need it ) had a ton of these speakers, didn't like the sound coming out of any of them, thus Sonos. Hi-Res audio, have it in my car, and am definitely not missing it in my Sonos. AirPlay would be nice, but again, not missing it. You can find flaws in everything, but today's companies are trying to tie us to their complete eco-systems. With all the competition, right or wrong, it's what we have to deal with as consumers. This system does what I need it for, whole house, clear and precise, distortion free, well separated, loud music. They just sound great. I use them everyday.

One thing I realized is that if you have a PlayBar hooked up to your TV, then you actually can us AirPlay through your Apple TV. This also resolves any latency issue, since the video and audio are coming from your Apple TV and to your TV/PlayBar, and therefore is the same as when you are streaming HBOGo or Netflix, etc. In other words, if there is any latency when you normally are watching something and using the PlayBar, then you can adjust that in your TV sound settings, and that will also prevent problems throughout your whole home setup.

The PLAY:5’s driver count has been upped from five in the old model to six in the refreshed design with six dedicated Class D amplifiers in support. Three tweeters and three mid-woofers are carefully positioned left, right and centre to deliver a surprisingly wide soundstage.\n\nTwo built-in microphones have been included in the speaker, which Sonos says will allow the speakers to automatically tune themselves to their surroundings, using the company’s new Trueplay auto-tuning feature. Right now, Trueplay has to use the microphone built into an iPad or iPhone to function, but the company are clearly working on making their smart speakers even smarter. At launch, the integrated microphones are disabled and reserved for future use, but their inclusion reinforces Sonos’ value as a perpetually-improving platform.\n\nThere’s no integrated Bluetooth support – but obviously you could connect a suitable third-party adaptor to the PLAY:5’s line-in jack if you were so inclined. The PLAY:5 can be oriented in three ways – like its little brother, the PLAY:3, the PLAY:5 can be positioned in a horizontal or vertical orientation and is smart enough to know which way it’s standing. The new capacitive touch controls work intuitively in each configuration – when positioned horizontally, simply tap the control either side for volume up/down, or use swipe gestures to navigate between tracks. Audio tones help you confirm the commands have been received.\n\nI’ve owned the last generation PLAY:5 for a couple of years now and loved it dearly, but the improvements Sonos have made with this new speaker are pronounced. That said, the difference between the generations varies somewhat depending on the type of music being played. I found heavier, noisier tracks to be more immediate and more enjoyable on this new model, but there’s less of a leap compared to the previous generation (maybe due to the production, who knows?). But the new PLAY:5 really comes into its own with quieter, more reflective tracks where it’s truly a class apart.\n\nPut simply, the new Sonos PLAY:5 sounds deeper, fuller and more resonant than the previous model with a wider soundstage. Side by side, playing the same tracks with the same EQ settings, the new PLAY:5 offers surprisingly more definition.

Moving into a house with no significant stereo equipment, this single unit transformed the place and in on stroke met all of our audio needs. Not that I will hesitate to get a second Play 5 soon.\nThere are complaints about the application and integration with Apple Music. The partnership of Sonos and Apple is young. I expect that between the two companies, they will continue to improve the interface. Most of the complaints I see in the amazon reviews stem from connectivity issues that seem to stem from poor wifi networks, not from this product.\n\nI am also deeply impressed by something I am seeing in these reviews. Sonos customer service representatives are responding to every negative review, especially those regarding connectivity. That is very encouraging. I think Sonos is going to lead the market with their products and we can have faith in their longevity and dedication to making a great thing ever better.\n\nLooking forward to Siri voice commands, integrated with Apple Music. I know other systems have some of this in place and working, but with this elegant hardware and partnership with Apple, I think it's going to become a way of life at home.

However, a couple of months ago, my Sonos 5 speaker stopped working and maintained a continuously blinking white light. Trying to actually find someone to talk to is nearly impossible as their support model is to contact someone in the user community. I finally got ahold of someone whose solution was to plug a cable in and hold down the power button for 30 seconds. Obviously, this didn't work, so he offered to send me a new speaker for $350. At this point, I ended the conversation.\nI did some research and found out this was likely due to a firmware update Sonos pushed out. I then sent an email to them, to which they responded they were sorry, but sometimes they have defective speakers. My Sonos 3 also stopped working with the same symptoms. So, now I have two very expensive \"disposable\" speakers. Please - Do NOT waste your money on Sonos.

I have added Sonos to each room in my home. I have several Play 1's which are great for portability and the small footprint. Also, I have the PLAY 5 and Sonos Connect. I was pleased with the original Play 5 and decided to add the new Play 5. Although I generally use the remote application the updated Play 5 has improved touch controls. It has a robust sound and premium feel. Overall the Sonos ecosystem is amazing. They are constantly adding the latest streaming support and it can easy find and index your music from any computer or networked device in your home. The app is intuitive and does not have a large learning curve. It is great for music at meal time or when you are hosting a get-together. When you add additional Sonos devices (after you buy your first you will inevitably want more) consider adding the Sonos Boost. It connects to your router via ethernet and creates a mesh network for the Sonos devices. No configuration and network setup, just plug it in and follow the steps in app. It can help isolate the Sonos from your other network devices which is helpful if you have a busy network with many connected devices. Sonos has excellent support as well.

I'd be fine just skipping them with the old software, but the system automatically limits functionality if you don't do the software update.

I am a huge audiophile and was looking for a speaker that had an excellently-balanced sound without paying bigger name brand price. The ability to expand the total speaker network to be as widespread as you want with adding more speakers is a major selling point. You can control any speaker in the house from the app. I also like the ability to have multiple music apps built right in to one single app controller. It IS possible to have more than one person's Spotify or Pandora logged in, it just takes some wiggling to figure out how to do it.

First impressions are pretty good, this coming from an admittedly fussy, critical listener. The initial set up got me a little off course, as I tried to pair the two speakers and found the instructions on the iPad app ambiguous. After a little troubleshooting for 10 minutes, it all came together and they produced a wide stereo image!\n\nHaving only briefly experienced Sonos at my sister's house, where she has one old Play 5 and a SUB, I really had no idea about adapting to the Sonos ecosystem. It takes a little adjustment, although I have got Pandora and Apple Music going quite well. My wife, who was keen to get a new sound system for music, was baffled at the non conventional set up and the limitations that come with it. I am trying to explain to her what is possible and not. For instance Karaoke will not work with Sonos! I have hooked up the TV to the line input and the sound from the Apple TV is pretty impressive, with a very minimal lip sync delay with the setting set on uncompressed. My son said it sounded like a real movie theater and thought it was much better that our main TV Sound set up, which actually is pretty decent, but seems to lack the crispness and detailed sound, from the pair of Play 5's. Makes me think about getting a Playbar for surround sound. I also have an Airport Express attached to the other line input on the other speaker, which allows me to access anything that can be played on an iPad and iPhone, so Youtube etc. are all available.\n\nThe bass from such a smaller speaker is impressive, although my wife asked for more bass, so I slid the bass control up to around 75% to fill it out more, which for me makes it a little thick and muddy. I also have the loudness on which at low volumes helps too. I will be getting the SUB, at a later date, as I am sure it will open up the sound and add even more weight and slam and I can lower the bass setting on the Play 5's. It was the SUB that initially caught my attention in terms of sound quality. I have plenty of experience with lesser subwoofers, that thump and are nearly impossible to make disappear acoustically. The SUB seems to be a very capable subwoofer and is rare, in that it can be placed in a room with great flexibility and blends seamlessly with speakers. It also has a very tuneful musical bass, based on my limited experience with it.\n\nThe Trueplay was interesting to set up, although having waved the phone around the room a few times, it said it needed minimal adjustments. Initially, I tried my old iPad 2 and that kept saying there was too much background noise, even though the room was dead quiet. I even turned the fridge off. Maybe it is not compatible. Anyway the iPhone 5 worked fine.\n\nI do find that battery life suffers through the day on my phone and dedicating an iPad as a controller might be the answer. Overall I am impressed at the thoughtful design that has gone into this speaker and ecosystem. With this speaker, I hear a big leap in sound quality, which bodes well for future offerings from Sonos. I am very glad I held off until these were released."},{"reviewerName":"pokwang","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Disappointed is an understatement.","reviewDate":"June 24, 2019","reviewText":"Power board blown after two years.

PERIOD.","reviewDate":"December 17, 2015","reviewText":"I agonized over buying the NEW Play 5's (HI-FI, CD quality) OR the BLUESOUND Pulse 2's (HI RES quality). The Play 5 has more dynamic range (even though the Pulse 2 is said to have more fidelity), and it was much cheaper, so I bought a stereo pair.\nAfter many hours of scrutiny, I've decided I love these speakers! The stereo separation is grand, the low end is all the bass most people would ever want, and, when you stream TIDAL or CD quality files, the HI-FI playback is clear and simple as the truth. Norah Jones was on stage in my living room, which is a big room to fill.\nThe Play 5 is good enough for an entry-level audiophile--if not many audiophiles--for sure. Plus, I went to a nearby Magnolia that demos the Play 5 and Pulse 2. The Pulse 2 came off a bit messy to me; the Play 5 does a better job of showcasing the highs, mids and lows. The Pulse Mini actually had more transparent sound than the Pulse 2, but it is too small.\nThe Play 5 has the best combination of scale, clarity, affordability, ease of use, streaming service options, power, design, and support of any all-in-one, streaming speaker. I have had a SONOS ecosystem with CONNECTs, PLAY 1's and PLAY 3's for some time, and I'm glad I stuck with them. SONOS is here to stay for quite some time, they will continue to update and support these Play 5's, which makes them future-proof even without the HI RES support. Besides, HI RES vs. HI-FI is not as important as quality amps and speakers versus lesser quality. And the SONOS is good quality--just as good a physical speaker as any other streaming speaker on the market, it plays CD quality superbly, and I look forward to all the great updates to come..."},{"reviewerName":"kinzie","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"incredible sound and performance, but still managed to get mislead and dissatisfied by Sonos.","reviewDate":"December 8, 2015","reviewText":"This is probably the only Non 5 star review and I'm probably the only dissatisfied customer of Sonos.\nWe bought a Play 5 in January and use it almost everyday and truely enjoy and love it. I registered with sonos and got their november newsletter about their enhanced new Play 5. so we decided to (finally) add another component, which we discussed for months. Make no mistake... the sound and performance is a solid 5 stars. Seldom do I purchase consumer electronics at full retail price. Sonos is THAT GOOD. The original Sonos is easy to unplug, lift and carry into another room, when necessary, which we do on the weekends, without any difficulty. The new version seems slightly heavier, has a better power cable, but does not have the \"handle\" on the back, so you need to use two hands to move it. The older version is considerably \"more portable\" because of this.\nthe new speaker sounds a bit better than the original. The sound is a bit more crisp and full with slightly better low range.\nthe volume/on/off button allows to advance to next track and the speaker can be oriented vertically, which is VERY nice for one of our locations. However, about 75% of the time, we're in the same space, and wanted to pair the new P5 to create a stereo pair. This is not possible, which I find disappointing if you want to add speakers over time. Not everyone will splash out 1000 or more dollars for 2 or more \"Components\". Since it's labelled a \"component\", we planned to add up to 4 units within a year or two. Nope. Aside from their outstanding performance and great reviews in every form of media, they STILL managed to allow customers to be mislead by building in non compatibility and \"hiding it\" in their or troubleshooting info that one would normally examine AFTER the purchase. it's amazing that the New Play 5 cannot be paired as a stereo with the previous generation that I purchased in the same calendar year!\nI will NOT be ordering a Playbar, pair of Play 1's, and a sub for the home theater."},{"reviewerName":"Consumer 35","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"The new app is horrible.

After this purchase I get rid of all my \"high end\" music gear, selling it or giving away to friends and family.\nMy B&W speakers did not sound much better and I am still wondering how it is possible.\nSuddenly I realized that my \"old\" system which cost me thousands is not really exceptional in the sound quality. It was hard to maintain it and it was always a struggle to try to hide all the cables behind it. Keep it clean and well organized.\nThe remote was like a computer keyboard with more than twenty buttons and small text prints hard to see and remember its location. Now I have simple app on my tablet and phone and a program on my computers if I want bigger interface.\nI think that it means a lot that Sonos brought on legendary producer Giles Martin (son of Beatles producer Sir George Martin) to help tune both the Play:5 and Trueplay so the end result was as close to the speakers you'd find in a studio as possible.\nThis little device does it is all and some more with a jaw dropping awe.\nI used to have more than fifteen wires going in and out of my a/v receiver and now most of that mess is limited to just power line and aux line in. I am planning to add one more speaker to get more stereo separation and resolution but even with this one speaker this is like a magic. Absolutely worth every penny and it is a must buy for any music lover. It streams anything without any problems or pauses. I only wish it could have a headphones output line included like in the old version model and the TruePlay feature is not only provided on Iphones. I do not have one and I think I should have an option to tune it without a \"need\" to buy or borrow a device I do not have. It should be solved by simply providing a customer with a separate mic as attachment with a long cable you connect to a connector on the back of the speaker for tuning purposes. Something I have had on my old system with the Multi-Channel Acoustic Calibration option.\nI have got my enjoyment of music back! Something a system costing many times more was unable to do!\nUPDATE:\nThe addition of the second speaker was a breeze. Very quick and trouble free process with only of exception of indicating to the system which speaker is the left one. As expected the sound field is now much wider and the stereo image is improved as well. Overall I am very satisfied with this second speaker and how this now pair of speakers performs. It is connected to my Samsung Smart TV via the TV's aux line to the right speaker line-in connector. The second speaker do not need to be connected to any source except wireless network and the power supply via the power cord. The TV acts as the switch and it is connected to my PC system via the HDMI cable. The TV serves as HD monitor and I watch movies or play music from a hard drives connected to my home network .The slight delay of the audio at about 70 ms is observed on some of the movies (out of synchronization of audio and video signals) due to conversion process.I think is better to set the audio compression in the advanced settings from the \"auto\" to the \"uncompressed\". Then you can try to add a Digital Coax and Optical Toslink to Analog Audio Converter and see how it works for you."},{"reviewerName":"Randy Lance","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"customer service is not worth a crap your better off spending your $$ on a high ...","reviewDate":"May 21, 2018","reviewText":"I’m very dissatisfied with Sonos play five.

Walking around Bestbuy, I end up getting one there (I was not planning but bought it anyway). So I “beat the crap out of this speaker” by listening to it every day, all day, with all sort of locations and settings. I have to say: It is a nice speaker with a solid built. Nice and simple design. I bought the white one and it looks amazing. Although the sound quality is good, I didn’t think it was worth the $499.00 price tag. Perhaps my expectations were a little too high, but this is the first time I spent this kind of money on a speaker. My mobile app experience wasn’t the a smoother one either. You have control everything via the app, which can be a little tricky: For example: Since it doesn’t come with a Remote control (which I don’t know why), you have to go in the app in order to turn down the sound. You can’t just pull your phone up and turn the volume up/down. You have to go in the app to do that, which is not very intuitive. The sound is good, not as great as I expected. Again, it is a solid speaker, and perhaps, it will sound amazingly well if you happen to have two speakers, but that is going way too crazy. If price tag was around $349.00 or even $399.00, then it would make more sense.

My own experience has been far from 5 stars, even if I wasn't particularly annoyed right now at my Sonos player (note, i am on the phone with \"customer service\") I can't imagine giving this more than 4 stars. If you like to stream your music from Apps like Spotify, Deezer, Audible or others than I can't imagine giving this product more than 3 stars. The quality of the sound is good, but it has been the most frustrating and high-maintenance technology purchase I have ever made, especially for a speaker.\n\nMy story:\nVery excited at the prospect of cable-less music and impressed by the Sonos design online, I purchased a Sonos play 5 online. The initial set up was not too complicated, it was annoying to have to set up 2 devices; the speaker and the BRIDGE. (I understand that SONOS has now gotten rid of the need for the BRIDGE?)\n\nThe music quality and the loudness were both very good as well. Soon, however, my feelings began to change as I grew accustomed to some of the annoyances of having a WiFi speaker.\n\n1.Streamed music is frustrating to setup\noptions for playing your music from Deezer or Spotify or Audible are very sub-par... the connection to your speaker is much more tedious and frustrating than the simple marketing messages suggest it will be.\n\n2. Streamed music is slow\nEvery time i wanted to change songs or look for a new song it took much longer than i wanted. The Sonos ability for connecting to streamed music has been too slow and it is super frustrating to wait for so many things to load when you just want to find or switch to a new song.\n\n3. No moving it around\nYou cannot expect to set this up in a new location if you need to move it -- whether to a friend's house for a party or to another room in your own house. Every time you unplug and move the Sonos something goes wrong and I felt like an idiot trying to make my \"fancy wireless speaker\" perform the most ordinary task... play music.\n\n4. Internet goes out, so does your music\nLet's be realistic, your internet probably isn't as reliable as you want it to be... i know that mine has trouble once in a while... so forget about playing any music when your internet is down.\n\n5. No easy Auxiliary Connection\nUsing the Sonos Controller App is clunky and slow, unfortunately there is no way to avoid it. Almost all of my problems would have been fixed if I could have plugged my iphone into the speaker and just hit play... but Sonos doesn't work like that. PROBABLY THE MOST ANNOYING THING OF ALL.\n\nI think that's enough, I don't want to be any more of a grouch about this. Just know that your experience will not feel like 5 / 5 stars. The main reason I am writing this review is because I suspect there is some funny business going on in this review board with all of these 5 star reviews.

Brandenberger","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Chose Sonos over Bose After Lots of Experimenting","reviewDate":"December 29, 2015","reviewText":"I moved from two inexpensive receivers (one with a 5-disc changer!) to the Sonos system, but not before a lot of research comparing Sonos and Bose SoundTouch. Here's what I learned: The Bose system attracted me given the Bose name, and I liked that all three sizes of the Soundtouch have line in/bluetooth (I want to play AirPlay via an Apple Express), etc. And I very much liked the 6 preset buttons on each speaker: having to look for one's phone to start or change the music is a challenge when the phone is on another floor or charging, etc.\n\nBut the Sonos system is well respected and has much to offer, so I bought both: one Sonos Play 5 and a SoundTouch 10 and a SoundtTouch 20 (expecting to take the Sono's back). Then I compared experientially. After a few days, the decision was clear: go with Sonos.\n\nFirst: the application for Sonos is way better: it's much easier to group rooms and switch between them, to choose music, and to organize one's music options. The Bose app is much less well-developed: it is clunky and limited and frustrating. The Sonos app allows one to set alarms to one speaker, or more, with choice of music stations. Such advantages offered by Sonos software outweighed the preset options supplied by Bose. (One can adjust volume and start/stop music on all the Sono's speakers, just no switching between stations).\n\nSecond, I wanted to be able to play via Apple Airplay, and Bose only does this one speaker at a time. To do so for a group of speakers in Bose, things are more complicated and less reliable. Airplay is actually well supported on Sonos if you have the Play5, for it has a line in (as do the Connects). Once you attach an Airport Express to the line-in for Sonos, you can play all the speakers in your system via Airplay (you can even name the Airport Express \"Sonos\" or like), grouped or individually. Good directions for such are given on the Sonos site.\n\nFurther: there seemed to be drops in connection with Bose that I don't experience with the Sonos. I also realized that with wireless connection I'd seldom use the line in or bluetooth on the Bose speakers. And, being Apple oriented, I sense that AppleMusic (now in beta on Sonos) will be more likely to work well Sonos (Bose seems to be in conflict with Apple, and has dropped Airplay).\n\nSo, I returned the Bose speakers, and bought two Play 1's to add to the Play 5. The build of the Play 1's seem to be of much higher quality than the Bose Soundtouch 10.\n\nThe sound is great! And I use the system all the time (a large advantage compared to more complex receivers)."},{"reviewerName":"GChance","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Sounds Great/LOTS of flaws","reviewDate":"January 5, 2018","reviewText":"I'll list the only positive first.

They get paid from the companies that are represented in their software, so it's likely your favorite app is not available). They now offer one music service within their app that can play podcasts, but it is a subscription based service that you must pay for separately\n\n*Speaking of software updates, be prepared to update software ALL THE TIME. Constantly. It is so frustrating to the point where we eventually stopped using Sonos because it was so much faster to hook up to my additional blu-tooth / shelf speaker system\n\n*This company has designed all of their language and marketing, to tell you why you need multiple devices to get the most out of their offerings. They are concerned will selling products and making licensing agreements with the apps that they choose to give access to. Sound and music is an afterthought.\n\n*Eventually the Play-5 stopped working all together on my MAC, and is now a paperweight. They updated it to the point where it is no longer compatible with my device. This will eventually happen to you too unless you continue to purchase new devices to support the speaker.\n\nBe forewarned and know what you are getting into. The only positive I can say, is that if you are fine accessing music you've downloaded to your device via their software, and you accept the fact the device has a 2-5 year lifespan, the sound is a solid 6 out of 10 and will suffice your needs."},{"reviewerName":"Matt","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"I paired this with the PLAYBAR for the surround sound ...","reviewDate":"January 13, 2016","reviewText":"I paired two of these with the PLAYBAR for the surround sound... oh my goodness....

This is no longer rocket science, but it seems that it is not in the best interests of Sonos to integrate with legacy, wired systems.\nI am very disappointed and may return the Sonos Play:5 for falling far short of it's hype.\nBe sure that this unit meets your needs before you buy - if it's out of their customer support window, you're toast.\nDoes anyone know of a software hack that would allow an iPod, Windows Laptop, or other device to broadcast the same audio signal from its audio (headphone) jack at the same time as the Sonos App was sending?

All thanks to its WIFI connection and its very in depth app... But that's about it.. Why 2 stars? Simple.\n\nFor the REST of us, that just want a plug and play option, this isn't for you. Period.. Plug and play for sonos means\n\n1-open iPhone app (if u don't have wifi plug into aux cord, more bout that later)\n2-Go to my music\n3-click on a song\n4-click play now... Or, 5 different options\n5-enjoy song.\n\n5 STEPS JUST TO LISTEN to a song. You can just plug and play. You need to specify when you want the song, what que, do u want to replace the que. ECT..\n\nAUX cord?\n\n1-plug in device\n2-open sonos app\n3-click input\n4-click aux\n5-leace app running in the back or else it shuts off.\n\nSO you CANT close the application, you HAVE to keep it open..\n\nWHY DIDN'T THEY JUST INCLUDE A SIMPLE $5 BLUETOOTH ANTENNA!?. The most basic function of ANY speaker.\n\nNow to the App.\n\n1- NEEDS TO BE RUNNING, period. Sonos won't work unless the application is up and running in the back.\n2- YOU CANT set your music to be an alarm. Music from your phone that is. WHY THE HELL can't you use your own music!? You have to import it, and that alone is so complicated I stopped. So you have music on your phone, the speaker PLAYS music from your phone, but you CANT set a song to be the wakeup music..\n3- The application runs no matter what. Yo are blasting music and get a phone call, you need to answer, then go into the app, wait for it load, then pause or lower the volume.\n4- Unless you are in the app, you can't control the music\n5- you set rules on the songs via iTunes such as, start and stop markers.. Sonos decided to not count those in. So a 5 minute song that you have it to end at 3 minutes? Enjoy listening to the entire song. Sonos doesn't recognize the stop marker.\n\nLastly,\n\nthey tried so hard in making such a great in depth application that they failed. So many freaking options just to play songs. add to que, replace que, play next, shuffle que.. Millions of options and not just play and go..\n\nFINAL NOTE:\n\nWHY THE HELL DOES A $500 SPEAKER NOT HAVE THE MOST BASIC FUNCTIONS SUCH AS BLUETOOTH.\n\n1-turn on Bluetooth on your phone\n2-connect to Sonos\n3-play music from your phone\n\nPERIOD! Set an alarm on your phone, it plays on the sonos. Take a call for s*** sake form your Sonos..\nDon't forget, the app NEEDS to be running for ANYTHING to work. EVEN an iPad connected to it via AUX cord. And don't get me started on having more than 1 device controlling the speaker.\n\nDONE purchase this. Period."},{"reviewerName":"E.

But if you're reading this you probably already knew that. Setup is fast and easy, you can join / separate \"rooms\" on the fly and guests can add songs seamlessly (once they know how to use the controller app).\n\nBut here's what you need to know about the revamped Play 5 — the audio quality just isn't that great, not for $500 / speaker. The new Play 5 sounds airy, flat and lacks definition throughout. I'm disappointed because it's been 6 years since the Play 5 (named the ZonePlayer S5 in 2009) first launched and while the 2015 update improves audio quality it doesn't compare to wireless offerings from B&W. Are my standards high? Absolutely. But so are Sonos's.\n\nI really wanted to like the Play 5’s, for most listeners it will be a great addition to a Sonos household (most people who buy Sonos already own at least 1 speaker). Today many people are perfectly happy with compressed audio and disposable ear buds – the Play 5 reinforces this trend. It comes down to a tradeoff do you need multi-room home audio? If so, you’ll probably be better off with Sonos if you don’t mind sacrificing audio quality. If audio quality is higher up on your list look elsewhere – B&W is a great place to start, or ditch wireless all together."},{"reviewerName":"Book buyer","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Deepblue 2 is a better sounding and more flexible speaker.","reviewDate":"January 11, 2016","reviewText":"I compared the Play 5 with the Deepblue2 bluetooth speaker which is widely considered the best bluetooth speaker.

I ended up returning it.\n\nThe company clearly invested a lot of thought and resources into developing the Play:5. In listening over the course of a week, I found that the bass range was uncannily punchy, the soundstage was vivid and pleasant; yet the high range sounded exaggerated, hyperreal--as if revealing the cold intelligence underlying the Play:5.\n\nIn an earlier era of hi-fi, the ideal was to reproduce audio faithfully with minimal processing. The Play:5 is a clear break from that tradition, and it's an impressive effort. Nevertheless -- and let me make an important qualification: I am commenting not on the Play:5, but on *my experience of music played through the Play:5* -- I came to feel it was a fine engineering achievement that does not necessarily bring me any closer to the music. Indeed, because the high-end response is so creepily real, it reveals the amount of sound processing happening, and I found myself wanting the Play:5 to simply chill out and let the music be great. I found myself wanting to suggest that Sonos embed musicians with the engineering teams."},{"reviewerName":"AmazonJohn","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Sound is great, Spotify integration is not","reviewDate":"October 17, 2015","reviewText":"I own two of the previous model of this speaker, and I love the sound, particularly given the amount of real estate the speakers occupy.

So please don't waste your time reading it, or your \"unhelpful\" vote: I'm saying in advance that I know that this review will be unhelpful to you. Thanks for your consideration.\n\nI listen to classical music on Spotify, and so I have hundreds of classical playlists (each representing a classical \"album\") and a dozen or so playlists of other kinds of music. These playlists are arranged in folders, making it easy to find my playlists. I can also search my playlists within the Spotify desktop and iPhone apps.\n\nIn the Sonos app, my Spotify playlists are presented to me in an unusable, seemingly random order. I have no option to reorder my playlists (alphabetically, by composer, by type, whatever). I furthermore have no option to search my playlists (the search function searches all of Spotify, not just my playlists). The result is that I can't find my playlists unless I scan the list and am very lucky to happen to see it while doing so.\n\nI've stopped using Spotify on my Sonos equipment altogether, it's just not usable given how I organize my music.

The Sonos only works through a proprietary app, Audiobooks simply don't work and Podcasts are so difficult to deal with it's just not worth the trouble. In addition, music doesn't pause when your phone rings. I works at home and I just want to listen to podcasts and radio and audiobooks without going deaf from using headphones 24/7. It would be nice to play music from my phone and be able to pause music when a call comes in so client's don't have to hear 2 bars of \"Raining Blood\" before I can pause it. This is a classic piece of over-engineered crap by a company that's worrying about tomorrows applications instead of today's basic needs. You can't even plug a jack into it, it HAS to go through the wifi or bluetooth and only through it's proprietary app. I know this is a rant, and I'm sure some people love it as much as my family does, but I don't see the selling point."},{"reviewerName":"Stacy and Kris","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"absolute garbage","reviewDate":"May 26, 2017","reviewText":"Absolute garbage.

At around five hundred price tag, it under-delivers. Sound is good but nothing exceptional at this price point.\n\n- Unlike most of the Bluetooth speakers, this is not really wireless. It requires power cable connected. It is W-Fi only or wired AUX. so you cannot just take it to the pool side or beach or anywhere where you plan to play music wirelessly as you would do with rechargeable Bluetooth.\n\n- Songs play for a minute or so and then suddenly restart from the begening. Happens a lot.\n\n- No Bluetooth option. Unlike Bluetooth, You cannot play whatever you want from whichever app you want.\n\n- Requires paid accounts from music providers to connect the accounts to Sonos. This means you need to pay $40-$90 per year per account for service provider just to stream on Sonos. The free TuneIn didn't really impress me. And Amazon Prime has limited collection.\n\n- You cannot stream from YouTube\n\n- Phone has to be connected to the the same frequency of the WiFi router connection as the Sonos otherwise you get device not found.\n\n- it does not have the WiFi connection to support AC frequency. I think it connects to Wireless N (way older technology)\n\n- Mine is going back. Even at hundred buck I won't clutter my house with it.\n\nSo here is what I think Sonos can do to change our minds (at least mine)....\n\n- offer 2 years for pro service from at least 2 music providers of our choice.\n- supply a plug in Bluetooth accessory to make it work with any music I want\n- Supply a portable rechargeable power source so I can use it anywhere."},{"reviewerName":"Knifeman","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"$500 and no power switch","reviewDate":"July 6, 2017","reviewText":"$500 and no power switch.

In my opinion you should look for a speaker system from a brand name that has a lot more history and quality of manufacturing for the price you are paying. In my experience the quality of the product and customer service do not come with the expensive price tag. After seeing those cool commercials with the colors spreading in rooms where the sonos speakers were playing, I spent several thousand dollars on several Play:5 speakers and a home surround system (sub, playbar and a other speakers) and here's what I learned.\n\nI bought my speakers all together 2 years ago. Now one of my PLAY:5 speakers do not work and all it does is flash a blinking red light. Here's what you are supposed to do when it flashes a blinking red light: call customer service as per the link on their webiste. [...]\n\nSo I did. I learned that my speaker is out of warranty (sadly the warranty ends after 1yr) and that they cannot do anything to replace it. However, the customer service rep said he could sell me a used/refurbished one. They would ship me a working refurbished speaker and I would need to send them back my defective speaker in exchange for a discounted price.\n\nWhy on Earth would I pay for a used / refurbished speaker after one that I bought only two years ago went defective on me. Let me get this straight. Customer buys a new speaker, after a year it breaks, customer is supposed to send back the broken speaker and pay for another used speaker that was refurbished and fixed. Another year passes by and it breaks again. The customer is supposed to send back said broken speaker and pay for another used speaker that was refurbished / fixed...and again and again and again. I don't believe this is good customer service. I think this is a scheme to make more money by making customers pay for manufacturing defects.\n\nCustomers who spend top dollar for a product demand excellent service. This to me seems like a scheme to generate more revenues from second hand faulty speakers. WHY ON EARTH WOULD I PAY FOR AN OLD REFURBISHED SPEAKER AFTER THE ONE I BOUGHT ONLY 2 YEARS AGO HAD A MANUFACTURING DEFECT??!?! Oh, and the best part that I forgot to mention - the refurbished speaker has a 90-day warranty. Yes, N-I-N-E-T-Y. Good luck with that.\n\nNice commercials but go find yourself something better.
