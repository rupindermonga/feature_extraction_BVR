DSLRs changed my photography for the better like nothing else. Five years and some 25,000 shots later, it's still going strong. Along the way I upgraded to the Canon 30D, which is a fantastic camera as well. When the 40D was announced, I decided to wait until the 50D sometime in 2009, but wanted a newer backup/second body for my photography needs. So when the XSi/450D was announced, it sounded like a perfect fit for my needs.\n\nI got it from Amazon.com three days ago, and have given it a pretty good workout since then, having shot about 650 shots under a variety of shooting conditions and with a number of different Canon and third-party lenses. The following are my impressions.\n\nThe build feels very good. The camera feels wonderfully light yet well built. I'm 6ft tall with average size hands, and the camera feels good in my hand. The battery grip, to me, defeats the purpose of having a small, light DSLR, so I opted for a Hakuba/Opteka grip (it's a plate that screws into the tripod socket that enables you to use the excellent Canon E1 hand strap with it) and I couldn't be happier. I'm not a fan of neck straps, so this works well for me (see the uploaded photo for the configuration).\n\nMost of the menu buttons on the back feel different from the ones on the original Digital Rebel and the 30D; the XSi buttons feel more tactile and have a definite \"click\" to them when you press them. The exception are the Exposure Lock (*) and AF selector buttons, which have retained the deeper, softer feel of the older cameras. Just different, not better or worse, for me.\n\nThe LCD is now 3\" with 230K pixels. The playback images look great, and probably because of the higher resolution of the sensor, there's a very slight delay when you zoom in to 10x while the image loads and displays properly. People coming from other cameras or brands might not even notice it--I only did so because of the difference between it and my two other Canon DSLRs (which have lower resolution sensors). The viewing angle of the LCD screen (how clearly you can see the screen from side and up and down) is excellent; you can still see the screen holding the camera almost straight up for an overhead shot (more on this later). I'd estimate the viewing angle is about 160-170 degrees both horizontally and vertically.\n\nThe Digital Rebel has a separate status screen above the main LCD screen, and the 30D had one on top of the camera, so I wasn't sure if I was going to like the big LCD acting as the status screen and no top screen. I'm happy to say that this arrangement works well, at least for me. The back screen makes it really easy to take all the settings at a glance. The viewfinder is much larger and brighter than that in the Digital Rebel. A humongously welcome feature for me is the always displayed ISO value in the viewfinder.\n\nThe camera is only 1/2 of the image quality equation, the other being the lenses being used. Coupled with my favorite lens, the Canon EF 70-200mm f/4 L telephoto lens, the XSi turns out fantastic images. The supplied kit lens is very light and compact for being an image stabilized lens, and turns out good performance. The IS is certainly very useful.\n\nTwo features that used to be missing from the Digital Rebels and found in the more expensive DSLRs are now featured in the XSi: spot-metering and flash exposure compensation (these may have been available in the previous Digital Rebel model, the XTi, as well). The inclusion of those two features make the camera a much more complete and compelling photographic tool. The timer function now has a custom mode, where it'll count down from 10 seconds then take a number of shots (specified by you) in succession. No more running back and forth to reset the timer after each shot! There's also the traditional 2-second timer.\n\nLet's talk for a minute about sensor and the ISO values. XSi/450D has five ISO values you can choose: 100 (best image quality), 200, 400, 800, and 1600. Higher ISO increases the camera sensor's sensitivity to light, thus you can achieve faster shutter speeeds for a given lighting condition. However, the trade-off is that the sensor \"noise\" (think grain for film photography) increases with higher ISO, so you get a degraded image quality in return for less blurred photos from hand shakes (thanks to faster shutter speed). This may come in handy in situations where flash photography is not permitted, such as a museum or a concert or theater. HOWEVER, compared to point-and-shoot digital cameras, the larger sensors of DSLRs, including the XSi, means that even at ISO 800 and 1600 you get very usable images right out of the camera. Running the images shot at those ISO settings through any number of third-party noise reduction software will improve them even further.\n\nThis ties in to another very useful feature of the XSi/450D that makes life easier for the photographer: The Auto ISO function. By default, Auto ISO sets the ISO (the sensor sensitivity to light) between 100 and 800 (by using custom functions, this can be changed to 200-1600). If you are, for example, shooting your kid's indoor basketball game and you know that you need a shutter speed of at least 1/200 sec to \"freeze\" the action, then you can set the camera to Tv (shutter priority mode) and set the value to 1/200, and set the camera to Auto ISO. Then the camera will match the aperture and the ISO to achieve proper exposure at that shutter speed. With my other DSLRs, setting the camera to shutter priority only allowed the camera to adjust the aperture value; ISO setting had to be adjusted manually. With the XSi/450D, the ability for the camera to adjust the ISO value automatically makes it one less thing for you the photographer to worry about.\n\nI've only tested the Live View function to see how it works, but I can already see how useful it's going to be in studio and macro shootings. Just a note, you can't half-press the shutter to autofocus while in Live View mode. You can either manual focus, or use one of the two autofocus methods, quick (the mirror flips up, the LCD goes dark for a short while, and flips down with focus locked) or live (the camera uses the LCD's contrast detection to achieve the focus--this method is slower than the quick method), both by pressing the exposure lock button (*) while in the Live View mode. Using either the RS-60E3 wired remote or RC-1 wireless remote in Live View mode will ONLY trigger the shutter, and has no bearing on focusing.\n\nSome people seem to be under the impression that the inclusion of the Live View feature will enable them to use the XSi/450D as they do point-and-shoot digital cameras, to compose their shots. That is not the case. You can't really make a functioning use of the Live View feature unless the camera's securely mounted on a tripod or on a flat surface. Both Live View focusing modes, while precise, are too slow to be used for hand-held shooting.\n\nHaving said that, there is one use of Live View in hand-held shooting that I've come to value. When shooting overhead or over an obstacle, I can, with the same hand holding the camera, trigger the Live View, compose the scene through the LCD monitor (even if it's out of focus, it's easy to get the general framing right), disable Live View, and take the photo normally. With a little practice, this can be accomplished very quickly. Very handy when you're just holding the camera overhead and hoping for the best.\n\nThe Direct Print button that's been much ridiculed and maligned in most Canon cameras now double as the white balance menu button. The Set button in the middle of the four-direction arrow keys can be programmed for a number of different functions: Change image quality, flash exposure compensation, LCD monitor on/off (same as Display button, but can be triggered by the same hand holding the camera), and Menu display (again, can be triggered by the same hand holding the camera).\n\nThere is a dedicated ISO button, which is also very welcome. It can easily be accessed during shooting with the right thumb, thereby minimizing the interruption to shooting.\n\nThe battery life seems very good. I've shot about 500+ shots on a single charge and the status monitor is still showing charge at full.\n\nI'm using Transcend 8GB Class 6 SDHC card with it. At ISO 100, the camera reports it can fit 396 RAW+JPG (highest quality) on it, but in reality it can probably fit about 420-450 (the camera's always conservative when estimating). With RAW only, it can fit 507. With highest quality JPG, it can fit 1,822. Note that as ISO increases, so do the file sizes and thus you can store less images per card. For example, on ISO 1600, the same card can only hold 323 images, compared to 396 at ISO 100.\n\nMy only gripe, and this is more about me than the camera, is the RAW+JPG buffer. I always shoot RAW+JPG, and the buffer will only hold four images at that speed (this is a limitation that's built into the camera's memory buffer system, and thus using a fast memory card doesn't help--see p.64 of the manual). When the buffer's full, you can take two additional images at about a frame a second, then have to wait until the buffer empties (finishes writing to the memory card). When shooting RAW only, it's 6 images. When shooting JPG only, then it's no problem at more than 50 frames. I've found myself switching the mode dial to Sports mode when I'm shooting a fast-moving subject and the buffer simply can't keep up with it. Well, that's why Canon produces different grades and ranges of DSLRs.\n\nI've uploaded some photos that I shot of the local wildlife. Most if not all of those were taken with the EF 70-200mm f/4 L lens.\n\nAll in all, it's a fantastic camera. Pretty amazing to see how far the entry-level DSLRs have come in just a few years in terms of features, interface, ergonomics, and quality. I'm very pleased with my purchase and intend to have lots of fun shooting pictures with it."},{"reviewerName":"Russell C.","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Happy Granddaughter","reviewDate":"June 19, 2019","reviewText":"I had given a Canon 40D to my granddaughter who uses it for school sports photography.

I don't have a photography background and had been using point-and-shoot digital models. I was afraid that the learning curve would be too steep for an SLR. I gave in and after a bit of research, opted for the Rebel XSI and I wish I had done it years earlier.\n\nIf you're like me, and hesitating about upgrading from a point-and-shoot because you don't think you know enough about photography, you'll be comforted to know that there is a whole host of automatic settings for this camera, making it the functional equivalent of a point-and-shoot -- except the pictures are infinitely better. I have had great success using the auto settings for all sorts of shots, from close-up portraits to flowers to beach scenes to no-flash school shots. I heartily wish I had had this camera when my children were babies.\n\nAt the same time, I have learned a great deal about the camera's manual settings just by trial and error, and reading on-line articles & books about it. I have a small business in the craft field and accurate close-up shots are critical to my business. I have learned how to use various settings to take amazing close-up shots, shots that have been complimented by professional photographer friends & graphic designers.\n\nI recommend purchasing the camera body only, and ordering a separate lens. I ordered a Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 II lens, which has been very versatile and more than enough for my needs in the first year-and-a-half of using the camera. I think it was a better lens for the money than the one that comes in the packages. I also recommend ordering an extra battery and charger to have on hand, so that you can always have a freshly-charged battery with you.\n\nI realize that my review will not be technical enough for real shutterbugs, but I really love this camera, and feel it is an excellent choice for folks like me who want to move into digital SLR photography but aren't quite sure where to start or whether they have sufficient knowledge to use an SLR camera."},{"reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"2017 review","reviewDate":"March 15, 2017","reviewText":"Bought this camera about a month ago on feb. 17, 2017 and if anyone was wondering if it's quality still competes in this year then I can tell you that yes it does."},{"reviewerName":"J. Nelson","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"GREAT digital camera - still holds up well against newer models","reviewDate":"November 3, 2009","reviewText":"The XSi is a great digital body, and should probably be bought that way (i.e., without a lens), so that you can save the money you would have spent on a barely-adequate kit lens to put towards something far better, such as the Canon EF-S 17-55mm f/2.8 IS USM Lens. While this Rebel has been superceded by the newer Canon EOS Rebel T1i, this model still provides excellent bang for the buck, and even exceeds the performance of the T1i in some respects.\n\nOthers have written at length and in great detail about the features and performance of this camera, so I'll just touch on a few highlights and some important distinctions between this and the newer model, the T1i. This model uses the same size digital sensor (APS-C) with fewer megapixels than the newer body. This fact, together with the less agressive noise-reduction implemented by the older DIGIC III processor in this camera, means that the XSi can provide lower noise in lower-light situations than the T1i, while still providing more than enough pixels to print even cropped sections of your photos up to 11x14.\n\nBy foregoing the video recording mode, DIGIC IV processor and high-resolution screen found on the T1i, the XSi body leaves more room in your budget for some important accessories, such as the 17-55 f/2.8 lens mentioned above, and one of the must-have Speedlite flashes, such as the top-of-the-line Canon Speedlite 580EX II or the still-very-much-worth-having Canon Speedlite 430EX II.\n\nBasically, if you want a compact digital camera body that accepts EF-S lenses and don't want to blow your whole budget before you even get to buy a lens or a flash, the XSi is right in the sweet spot of great performance for a reasonable price."},{"reviewerName":"Stack⠀Overflow","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"One Word - Wow!","reviewDate":"March 15, 2010","reviewText":"The XSi is my first DSLR camera. I have, for many years, been shooting with point-and-shoot (also called \"compact\") cameras, so I have a lot of experience with point-and-shoot cameras. But the image quality of the XSi simply blew me away! The images captured on the XSi are much, much, much sharper than the ones from a point-and-shoot camera!\n\nIf you're looking at the XSi, you're probably a budding photographer like myself. The XSi is, debatably, the best entry-level DSLR camera, next to the Canon EOS Rebel T1i/500D.\n\nHighlights\n----------\n- 18mm - 55mm \"Kit\" Lens Included\nThe Canon EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS SLR Lens alone sells for [...]. You have everything you need to get started right away with taking great-looking pictures!\n\n- Phenomenal Images\nAlas, I'm unable to show you the images I've captured with the XSi here. But there's alway sample images uploaded by customers on the product page. Alternatively, you can go to the Canon site and see for yourself the official sample images. These images are pretty representative of the quality of images you can expect from this camera in optimal conditions.\n\n- Auto Mode\nOkay, so you're not quite prepared to tinker with the bells and whistles on the XSi. No matter, there's always a fully \"auto\" mode (green rectangle on the selection dial) you can fall back on. In this mode, you would be using the XSi just as you would a point-and-shoot camera. The auto mode will stifle your creativity, but it will help you take great pictures nonetheless.\n\n- Incredible Battery Life\nI must have taken hundreds of pictures of pictures and the battery indicator bar still shows full battery capacity (that's with image preview disabled- which is, if I'm not mistaken, the default/factory setting).\n\nIn sum, the XSi does everything your point-and-shoot does, only BETTER.\n\nIf, like lot of people, you are in a quandary deciding between the T1i and the Xsi/450D, here are the major improvements of the T1i over the XSi (at least on paper) to help you make a decision:\n\n- 15.1 MP Resolution\n- Full HD video at 20 Frames Per Second\n- ISO range of 100 to 3200\n- 920,000 dots VGA monitor\n\nvs. the XSi:\n\n- 12.2 MP Resolution\n- No video capability\n- ISO range of 100 to 1600\n- 230,000 dots VGA monitor\n\n* T1i vs XSi *\n\n- Resolution: 15.1 MP vs. 12.2 MP\nWhen it comes to megapixels (MP), I would have to subscribe to the mantra that megapixels isn't everything. Since the T1i has the same sensor size as the XSi (APS-C size: 22.2 x 14.8mm), a higher number of megapixels would mean more pixels packed into same sensor area.\n\nKeep in mind that as a general rule, the higher number of megapixels that are packed into a given sensor area, the more \"noise\" (or graniness) will result in a picture taken in low light conditions. (I want to be fair, however, and say that I have not noticed perceptible differences in image quality between the two cameras, even in moderately lit or low light conditions.)\n\n- HD Video\nThe T1i frame rate is 20 frames per second (fps), which is low compared to even the low-end camcorders, most of which are capable of 30 fps in Full HD. The XSi has no video mode.\n\n- ISO: 3200 vs. 1600\nLike they say, there's no such thing as a free lunch. A higher ISO *will* result in more noise in a captured image. As a rule of thumb, set your ISO to the lowest practicable ISO setting. The lower upper range for the XSi isn't, in my opinion, a big restriction.\n\n- LCD Resolution: 920,000 vs 230,000 dots\nThere is absolutely no refuting that the LCD on the T1i *is* better than the one on the XSi. The images displayed on the T1i LCD is unquestionably sharper than the images on the XSi LCD.\n\nBased on the above factors, you will have to be the one who ultimately decides what works better for you.\n\nThere are, of course, other considerations, the most glaringly obviously of which is - you guessed it - the price. The price of the XSi is has dropped like a rock since I purchased it a couple of months back. If you're on a tight budget, the XSi is definitely the way to go.\n\n---\nThe image quality from the XSi is simply phenomenal. It is very affordably priced (it has gotten much cheaper than what it sold for originally when it debuted in 2008). If you're on a budget, the XSi is, in my opinion, the best DSLR camera to get."},{"reviewerName":"MD","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great camera for an entry-level DSLR!","reviewDate":"July 17, 2009","reviewText":"Ah, the Canon EOS450d. (Or Digial Rebel XSi, for those who dislike model numbers) I've owned it for several months now, and have a lot of good experience with it.\n\nI purchased the XSi with kit 18-55mm IS lens back in the end of February, before a week-long vacation in the Caribbean, thinking I could get some great shots. Now, I'm not going to say it was all perfect. I mean, this is my first DSLR to actually own, and to think I could learn the system that quickly was a little overzealous of me.\n\nWith that said, the camera and kit lens offered some great quality pictures, with very good color representation, and very good sharpness in most situations. Image stabilization, though I didn't realize it at first, does wonders. The IS on this lens did in fact enable me to shoot at about 2-stops slower shutter speeds than normal, pretty consistently.\n\nThe camera itself is great. The build feels quite solid, though not as much as the heavier, higher-level cameras. (50d, 5d II, etc.) The navigation is definitely an easy adjustment to make from a point-and-shoot (P&S) camera. I was easily able to scroll through menus using the directional buttons, for instance, as opposed to the wheel used in some other models of Canon DSLR. It isn't necessarily better, but it does make the system much more approachable for someone new to the DSLR game.\n\nThe screen is great--since February (about 5 months now) I've used the camera for thousands of pictures, and have only noticed an inability to see the screen clearly due to light on a handful of occasions, in extreme sunny conditions.\n\nThe flash, while not fantastic from a DSLR standpoint, is quite solid, and reaches a decent enough distance. However, with the built-in flash, you are limited to 1/200 shutter speed, at its fastest. The recharge time is also a bit longer than I'd like, in general, but it's nothing debilitating. If you need to be capturing any faster, you probably should have spent more money on a higher-end camera, anyway.\n\nThe menus are quite plain, but clearly laid out in such a way that they are easily navigable and can be learned quickly and simply. You may not even use most of the menus, if you're much like me--I rarely find the need to use bracketing for my exposure or flash, for instance, though they are simple to set up and use if desired.\n\nFor a while, I was stuck in the mentality that it is only worth owning a DSLR if you intend to use manual mode. I'm beginning to learn that it isn't ALWAYS the case. I have found myself switching to Auto mode on more than one occasion, either to capture a shot more quickly, or just to see what settings the camera recommends, before re-adjusting in manual mode. Additionally, if you intend to shoot in RAW format, you cannot use Auto. RAW, for those who don't know, is a format not compatible with computers, digital frames, etc. You must first convert RAW to some format like JPG,(don't worry, Canon includes software which you can use for this) which can then be printed or viewed at your leisure. RAW does allow more flexibility with editing your photo, but might be a bit over the heads of some people. In either case, it is worth noting that you CANNOT SHOOT RAW IN AUTO MODE! I frequently use RAW mode and touch up areas of the photo that would otherwise come out poorly. But auto mode is friendly enough for my girlfriend to use the camera, so it makes our lives quite a bit easier when she needs to take over the camera briefly.\n\nLive view mode is a fantastic addition, in my opinion. Many have told me that Live View is really a mode made for P&S'ers who aren't quite ready for DSLR. I have to respectfully disagree. That might be the case on occasion, but honestly, for some shots, I've found that when the focus hunts a bit, and I need to manually focus, the Live View mode is absolutely great for getting the sharpest image possible. I tend to use 10x magnification, and rotate the focus ring slightly until I find the \"sweet spot\" and focus is tack-sharp. It has saved my photos on more than one occasion, though for a quick or speedy subject (fast sports, energetic children, pets, etc.) obviously this is a bit more limited in its viability. I would also like to note that YOU CANNOT USE LIVE VIEW WHILE IN AUTO MODE!!! You have to make adjustments to shutter speed, aperture, and ISO on your own when using Live View, so it does still have a bit of challenge with it.\n\nOn the software side, I honestly prefer the use of Photoshop, so I have only used Canon RAW and the rest of the photo editing/managing software a little bit. With that said, if you don't feel like shelling out the extra cash for Photoshop, which I completely understand, Canon RAW is very good for its purposes. You can adjust all the RAW settings as needed, convert to JPG, or anything else you need to do. The other software I'd like to point out is Gimpshop, with the RAW editor plugin. (ufraw is the name, if I recall correctly).\n\nWith all that out of the way, i'd like to say that I was definitely one of those people who debated if I should start low, or advance myself to a higher (possibly older, for the price) model to start with. Sometimes I still wish I had purchased the 40D at a comparable price. But I am quite happy I started with the XSi, because it's a very reasonably priced camera and lens for its capabilities, and is very easy to use for a beginner with a DSLR--though it's still capable of most mid-level features, making it quite a good camera.\n\nSome have looked into the new Digital Rebel, with video. That might be an option, but before spending the extra cash, ask yourself how often you'd use the video camera feature--if you would use it, by all means go ahead. I considered the option, and found that it wasn't worth the extra cash. Nor is the megapixel upgrade--for most amateurs, you won't be blowing any images up, so while a ~15mp camera is technically \"better\" than a ~12mp camera, you won't see a difference until you blow it up to the size of a computer sheet or greater--how many photos do you have of that size in your home?\n\nI strongly recommend this camera for any beginner working their way to better photography using a DSLR. If you do decide to take the plunge, don't expect your photos to magically be better--learning the capabilities (and limitations) of DSLR is extremely important as well, or your pictures might wind up coming out WORSE than your P&S photos.

The controls are intuitive, and after a little practice you can use them without having to take your eye off the viewfinder - the ISO control, the exposure compensation, the viewfinder is familiar to any Canon SLR user, etc... The grip is comfortable, and provides good 'grip'. The LCD panel is bright, and displays all relevant information in a readable, usable manner. The mode dial allows you to switch on the camera with a gentle flick to the wheel, and the camera itself switches on almost instantaneously.\n\nThe battery, when fully charged, can take almost a thousand shots before requiring a recharge. Even when using the flash, I was able to take more than a hundred shots before the indicator dipped to the low marker.\n\nSince this camera can accept both regular and EF-S lenses, there is a white marker on the body for aligning the EF-S lenses when mounting them on the body, and a red marker for the regular lenses. Nice!\n\nThe negatives, in my opinion:\n- Flash photography results, especially indoors, and with the built-in flash, are not too good. You will have to experiment a lot to get acceptably good results. This may be an issue with most cameras when using the built-in flash, and you may need to go in for an external flash. So this is not necessarily a negative against the Canon XSi, but more an issue with most cameras I think.\n- The tripod socket at the bottom has the camera's serial number next to it. So, after screwing and un-screwing the tripod head a few times to the camera body, you are very likely to end up scratching off the serial number completely. Also, you will need to swivel the tripod head to open the battery cover. This is also bad for the serial number sticker. This may not matter much, unless you need to get the camera repaired. Bummer. In any case, this is not optimal design.\n- If you switch on the \"Long Exposure Noise Reduction\" custom setting on, it can take 5, 10 seconds or longer before you are able to take another photo. So be aware of that. This depends on the length of the exposure itself. For 30 second exposures, this post-processing can take almost as long.\n- The exposure compensation indicator still does not go beyond showing 2 f-stops in either direction. This is supposed to be on account of a patent issue, but it still reduces usability somewhat.\n\nOn the whole, an excellent camera, but not without its flaws."},{"reviewerName":"MoonPye","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Canon never disappoints me","reviewDate":"May 25, 2010","reviewText":"I am an amateur photographer and have been shooting with various point & shoot digitals as well as the old 35mm SLRs (several Canons were in the two above categories). This is my first dSLR and wasn't sure exactly what to expect. The camera feels good (I have small hands, I've seen some complaints about the feel of the camera, so thought I'd mention it in case it makes a difference). It took very good photos right out of the box, but now that I am learning how to access all the options it can take quite breathtaking photos. I was extremely happy to learn my old SLR lenses would fit on this camera so I have a wide range of options for shooting, from macro to telephoto. (Good thing too, because quality lenses are expensive.) The lens in the kit was not overwhelmingly impressive but it does very well with macro (I also screwed on a 10X magnification glass on it) but I'm sure for the beginner it would work in many different situations and more than good enough to use while saving up for better lenses.\n\nThis camera handled action photos well. I have several small children who are always moving and I've gotten some very interesting shots of them in motion. Also when doing a portrait, the bokeh on this camera is very nice.\n\nIt's very simple to download the images into either one of my computers (desktop or laptop). I haven't played with their software too much so I really cannot comment on that yet. I am very happy they included a program for their RAW images, though.\n\nI skipped over reading the entire manual and instead refer to Ben Long's The Canon EOS Digital Rebel XSi/450D Companion.\n\nI also really like that on timer mode you can take up to 10 pictures instead of just one, which is great for family shots ... you get 10 chances to get one where everyone's got their eyes open. lol\n\nThe life on the battery that came with it is long lived. I also splurged for a couple of extra batteries so I'm not in a situation where I'll miss some great shots because my battery died. (This kit also came with a battery charger.)\n\nHIGHLY recommend this camera, I just love it."},{"reviewerName":"Elliott S. Mccrory","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great camera, *BUT* my images are not very sharp","reviewDate":"September 23, 2010","reviewText":"This review is hard for me to write. This camera is a great camera, and everyone who has credentials says that it takes great pictures--almost as good as more expensive cameras. This may be true for some, but it has proven to be problematic for me.\n\nMy gripe is with the sharpness of the images I get.\n\nWhen I take a picture with this camera in anything but perfect conditions (e.g., outside on a sunny day with the sun at my back), I see blur in the image long before I see pixels. My wife has an ancient Canon SD200 (3.2 MPixel) camera, and in all situations (except \"perfect\"), in an A-B comparison of the two images (one from her camera and one from the XSi), the SD200 images are usually sharper. I can zoom in on the pixels in the two images, and at the zoom level at which I see pixels in the SD200 image, I see blur in the XSi image.\n\nI know, I know, \"apples and oranges\". The SD200 lens is an f8 (or something) 8mm and this one is an f3.5 18mm. But what do I know? I know which image is sharper, and it is the SD200.\n\nThe really frustrating thing for me is that the images on the SD200 in low light are better, too. Of course, the image stabilization of the 18-55 lens helps a bit, and the XSi will \"win\" sometimes because of this (the SD200 does not have IS). But, again, the A-B comparison is revealing: the SD200 wins most of the time.\n\nForget about low-light close-ups with this camera. Use a small-sensor camera for that! You can get a LOT closer with those tiny, stopped-down lenses!\n\nThey say, on the Internets, that there is a possibility of the focusing hardware being slightly off and in need of \"calibration\"--that would explain my troubles. But I have tried f22 tests, tripod tests, and manual focus (intentionally putting the image slightly out of focus in each direction). I have also tried RAW capture and playing with the sharpness in the Canon-supplied software.\n\nI just cannot get truly sharp images with this camera.\n\nI suspect that there may be something wrong with the specific instance of the Canon XSi that I own. Maybe my camera was manufactured on a Friday afternoon before a 3-day weekend, and that my wife's SD200 is one of those incredible convergences of a happy day with happy workers making a perfect instance of a good camera.\n\nI just purchased a Canon 7D to replace this camera. I'll let you know how this 18.1 MPixel \"Image Monster\" compares to the SD200. :-) And look for my XSi on EBay soon."},{"reviewerName":"Wise Counselor","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Canon XSi Delivers on Quality","reviewDate":"May 18, 2010","reviewText":"I purchased the Canon Rebel XSi about a month ago after much deliberation about when to buy and which Rebel model to select. I decided on a Canon for two reasons. I own a 35mm Rebel Xs SLR (familiar) and Canon lenses. The lens is what really makes an SLR shine and there are a vast assortment of canon EF and EF-S lenses available. I particularly like the EF L series lenses which I plan to buy 'used' as my budget allows. The XSi model allows me to take advantage of these lenses without going to a full frame DSLR or the more expensive APC D series cameras. At the time that I purchased I had four Rebel choices: Rebel XS, XSi, T1i or T2i. I was tempted toward the T2i but cautioned toward the XS or XSi models. The T1 and T2 cameras offer video at high def but neither can auto focus while recording video so until that improves it will not suite me. Ultimately I decided against these because of price and cost of ownership. These cameras are impressive but in order to edit the HD video you will need a computer that can handle the format and also be able to render HD video without taking up half a day. I already own a Standard Def Canon FS-10 camcorder that I have owned for about a year and have yet to fully exploit it. I ruled out the XS based on resolution, metering and the LCD screen all of which are much better in the XSi. The XSi is a superb camera and with an L lens is awesome. I have the kit lens but have borrowed some higher quality EF 'L' series lenses and the difference the lens makes is astounding. Ultimately if you must spend money buy a solid camera like the XSi and spend the bulk of your money on the lens. Happy with my XSi."},{"reviewerName":"Hypnosis4U2NV","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Best Basic DSLR Kit","reviewDate":"February 18, 2009","reviewText":"As a parent of two rapidly growing children, I was getting frustrated with my point and shoot cameras slow shutter lag; causing me to miss those never-to-be-seen-again picture moments. So I decided to get myself an entry level DSLR. After talking with friends, researching the internet and a recent Consumers Report review of DSLRs, I decided that the XSi was just the camera to get me started.\n\nI have been truly amazed at the quality of the pictures I have been taking using its automatic settings. Fast Shutter Speed and Continuous shooting almost guarantees I will never miss memorable moments again. Battery life is really impressive as Ive taken hundreds of pictures on one charge. Even though I am still experimenting with all the automatic and manual settings, the included manual really helps in explaining all the settings and how to use them. For a novice like myself, the information provided is clear and easy to understand. The included lens features Auto-Focus and Image Stabilization and is pretty decent for a starter lens. Interchangeable lenses make these DSLRs very versatile in any shooting condition.\n\nNow my review is not as detailed as others have posted here because I'm nowhere near a skilled photographer, but I hope to help others who are thinking about getting into DSLR picture taking like I have. I am really enjoying this camera's features and abilities. It's very easy to use on its basic automatic settings and even more fun playing with its manual ones.\n\nIf your looking for the perfect camera to start off, please give this one a chance. You wont find a better starter kit than whats being offered at this price range."},{"reviewerName":"Hankie","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"... for a short time and it seems to do great.

I'm here to say I ignored his suggestion and am glad I did. I've only had the XSi for a week, so haven't taken more than 100 real shots yet, but I'm really pleased.\n\nFirst off, the XSi is $200 cheaper than the 40D (at the moment, it varies greatly) and 2/3rds the weight, both of which I appreciate. I've never used the 40D so my comments below are about the XSi and the improvements over the Xti.\n\nPros:\n\n* Bigger screen is great for viewing your results and checking the settings.\n* Seeing the ISO in the viewfinder is wonderful! In the past I'd messed up shots because I'd left it set wrong, but no longer.\n* The viewfinder seems brighter and easier to view (haven't used in low light yet).\n* New Auto ISO makes getting quick shots in changing light easier, though I'll manually set it for shots when I had time to check all my settings.\n* Digital noise seems to be slightly reduced than the Xti.\n* Battery life is *excellent*. I've only charged it once so far.\n* Even though the Live View focusing is a little funky, it works pretty well. I can definitely see using it for night shots when the viewfinder is too dark (or maybe it won't be anymore?). Nice touch that you can display a 3x3 grid on the screen for composition. For auto-focusing, I prefer the Quick Focus mode, which blanks out the Live View while you're holding down the * button and the focusing is happening, but it's definitely usable. The other auto-focus mode (Live Mode) takes so long that I won't use it. Manual focusing is made much easier since they've added the ability to zoom in 10x in Live View, which is *wonderful*. I'd missed that feature when I moved up from my Panasonic FZ30, which had it.\n* I like having the new spot metering for night shots.\n* I *really* like the new \"My Menu\" where you can select your favorite 6 menu options and they show up first, which means less digging through menus.\n\nCons:\n\n* Highlight Tone Priority feature eliminates the ISO 100 option, which means you can get a little more digital noise. And you can still get blown out highlights. Maybe I'm not using it right or expecting too much?\n* Buttons on the back of the camera are more recessed than the Xti, making it less-obvious when you're trying to hit the right one w/o looking. It's also *really* crowded back there! Tough having fat fingers!\n\nNeither pro nor con:\n\n* RAW files are much bigger than in the Xti, many around 14MB, which means you get fewer shots per memory card (135 RAWs on a 2GB card, vs 197 on the same sized card in my Xti). I expected a little increase from the increased resolution, but didn't count on the increase in the A/D bits from 12 to 14 to increase things too. This also makes file transfers and loading into image editing software slower, and I think I'll need a bigger hard drive soon!\n* When reviewing photos, you can hit the Disp button to see more shot details. Hit it once to just add that the storage format and picture count, which I *don't* think is worth its own step. Hit the Disp button again to see the brightness histogram. Hit it once more to see the luminescence histogram plus 3 small histograms for Red, Green and Blue. Personally I don't have use for this last mode (or the second), so wish there was a Custom Function to disable them.\n* High ISO noise reduction - another feature I've turned off in Custom Functions. Better to do advanced noise reduction on the computer. Plus is slows down the continuous shooting mode to about 1.5 shots per second! Ugh.\n\nAll in all the XSi is a really nice pro-sumer camera that lets you get down and dirty with details when you want but can also rip off quick shots w/o thinking about every little setting."},{"reviewerName":"rdkmco","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great Camera! Better than competition!","reviewDate":"September 1, 2009","reviewText":"This was the third DSLR I purchased, the other two being Nikon D60's. (returned both of those and bought the Rebel, which I should have done in the FIRST PLACE). I wanted to get back in to SLR/35 MM equivelant cameras from POS ones I used for many years now. Compared to the Nikon D60, this camera is well worth the extra money. I have used the Xsi for three months now and my daughter has also used for school. I have taken sporting shots, animals, family, scenery etc..and except for the auto settings to be sometimes inconsistent, the picture quality overall is fantastic. I take most of my pictures on full resolution and crop to my liking later and the Xsi allows for some really nice cropping results because of the 12.2 MP it offers. The Nikon is only 10.2 MP but that was not a deciding factor. The extra MP are a bonus, but you will see no difference in prints between 10 and 12 MP in reality. Battery Life has been excellent and since I like to take action shots, I have used this camera at several sporting events this year. Most of the bad pictures, (yes, there are some from time to time) are likely as a result of the user, me. Once I got to understand the settings a little better, my action shots got better. If you want a DSLR and do not want to spend much more than $1,000 for a body, and two lenses, this basic kit plus the EF 55-250 MM lens, this is a great camera. I still have a few POS cameras that take equally good pictures, so won't recommend on picture quality basis alone. If you want a camera that takes great pictures, and do not really want the DSLR for it's SLR capabilities, save your money and get a POS. The Rebel is not really portable, and unlike a POS, you cannot fit in a pocket or conceal if you need to. It is a DSLR for more serious photography. I do recommend this camera, but please do not consider as a replacement to your POS, but rather a companion to it. I still enjoy my Panasonic TZ5 POS camera, but really like the Rebel XSi and would recommend over any other entry level DSLR camera. Spend the extra for this (or Rebel Ti) if you are also looking at the Nikon D40 or D60. Also, it IS made of basically plastic, as are the other cameras on the market of this grouping. It does not feel particularly clumsy, but I did purchase a Delkin rubber skin and it works wonderfully!"},{"reviewerName":"bik kinbun","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great introductory DSLR","reviewDate":"November 6, 2009","reviewText":"This was my first SLR since converting to digital. I previously had a 35mm Canon Rebel that I loved although it was rather basic and old, then I had a Canon Powershot which was good. I was hesitant to switch to a digital SLR because I thought the Powershot was all that I would ever need; after all my old Rebel film camera was lacking in features and took average shots - so a point-and-shoot digital was better. Why would I need anything more than a point-and-shoot?\n\nI was so wrong. The Canon Rebel XSi is an awesome camera, loaded with useful features that are easy to figure out. The Rebel line has come a long way in innovation since going digital, and the control and quality of a DSLR cannot be touched with a point-and-shoot. I still like my point-and-shoot because I can keep it in my pocket for easy traveling; but the XSi is my main camera.\n\nIf you are new to digital SLRs, or new to SLRs, or new to photography; or upgrading from a point-and-shoot -- this is the camera for you. If you have the extra money for the T1i, it's a little better with video; but the XSi is still great for photography.\n\nCheck out the manual by Ben Long for a great set of instructions on how to use this camera.

People who do not at least touch on these topics before their submersion into the world of SLRs will find the acclimation much more difficult, if not intolerable (as some very mislaid one-star reviews illustrate).\n\nMy XSi has helped me reach untapped creative potential that I hadn't deeply considered before. I am an artist, a painter, and my primary reasons for getting an XSi teeter between photographing my paintings for my personal records and for sale on the Internet as well as for my introduction into the realm of artistic, fine art photography. In my first few weeks of use, I can say unequivocally, and rather giddily, that the XSi achieves my hopes and quite a bit more.\n\nMy first reason for upgrading to the XSi, and to an SLR in general, is image quality. I simply wasn't content with the grain, blur, and poor coloring that most point-and-shoots afford. Aside from using my camera for normal, everyday portrait, indoor, and vacation shots, I also wish to use it professionally, to photograph my artwork and to take artistic photographs. Clarity and integrity of the image are enormously welcomed with the former, average tasks and absolutely essential in the latter, more artistically focused ones. The XSi allows me to achieve crispness, faithfulness with colors, and -- THANK GOODNESS -- far less, or absolutely no, grain in my images when shooting indoors. I am as happy as a bird with a French fry.\n\nI have to urge that practice makes perfect for an SLR beginner. There are a plethora of settings, terminology, and camera hardware that require education to comprehend and perfect. I am new, I am learning, and I am enjoying the process of unlocking the powers of my XSi camera. I imagine it will be some time before I can consider myself rather well informed about what the camera can achieve, but even out of the box and into my amateur arms, the camera takes spectacular photographs! As extremely complex machines go, this camera is insanely easy to navigate and control. The buttons on the camera itself are perfectly placed, and the menus on the large LCD screen are just as easy to maneuver. I am thoroughly impressed with the ease of use. I have zero complaints.\n\nOne would do well to browse the web for information about the features and functions of the Canon XSi before the camera even arrives. I spent a few hours reading and watching some very helpful videos on sites like YouTube to familiarize myself with the capabilities of the camera before the box arrived at my door. I can tell you without doubt that the information I learned before I laid eyes on my camera helped tremendously. I knew what buttons to push as soon as I had my hands on it!\n\nMore specifically, I have no complaints about any elements that came with the camera. The kit lens is superb - and that truly may be the only lens you ever need. I did purchase the f1.8 II 50mm Canon lens at the same time I purchased the camera on Amazon, simply because I was so impressed with the customer photographs that had been uploaded as examples. The clarity achieved with the XSi kit lens is stellar, but I think the 50mm lens is a beautiful accessory to treat yourself to... it takes unique images that can only be achieve with that particular lens.\n\nI also purchased an extra Canon battery so that I never have any camera downtime spent charging. The extra battery was a pricey $50 more, but I have already enjoyed the ease of having two batteries a great deal since owning my camera... well worth the money. I also purchased cheap filters to fit the kit lens of the XSi and I have already noticed higher color saturation in certain instances when using a polarizing filter. It's great fun to experiment!\n\nOut of doors and indoors, the XSi performs masterfully. In low light and in high light, the XSi performs masterfully. I am a student with very little discretionary funding, so I had reservations about spending so much on a camera. I haven't looked back since getting my silver XSi, and there's simply no hint of buyer's remorse here. Put plainly: you get what you pay for here and I wager even a bit more. I am in passionate love.\n\nBuy her.

I almost immediately bought a zoom up to 300mm because I like to zoom :)\n\nIt also does not have a very low f number, which means it's not the greatest in low light, although there is the built in flash. It also means the depth of field does not blur the background very much (it seems more obvious when you zoom in). Almost all of the time it doesn't go lower than f/5.6 :(\n\nDoes not have full time manual focus (which means it autofocuses and you can adjust the focus manually whenever you want.) It took me a while to realize I had to switch the thing to Manual Focus (MF) to control the focus!

My latest P&S is a Canon S3 IS, which has a nice zoom and takes good pics. It may never be used again.\n\nThe first thing I immediately noticed is the depth of field that the XSi produced. I forgot how good an SLR could be. Upload the pics to your computer and the clarity and color of the photos are just unbelievable. Night or indoor shooting is equally amazing. I never got good results when I disabled the flash on my P&S cameras, but I am shocked at how well the photos turn out in a low-light situation when not using the flash on this one.\n\nThe camera and lens does feel a bit cheap with all of the plastic. But, I plan on taking care of it, so I'm ok with that. The battery seems to have a lot of juice in it for hundreds of pics before recharging (2 hour charge). I don't see myself using the \"live view\" function too much. It doesn't really work like a P&S like it may seem.

Yeah, I had done all of the online and in-store research, read through myriads of model reviews and pondered my desired requirements, but you never know how things are going to go until you have the product at home and have used it a few times. Bottom line is that the Rebel XSi is easy to use and takes great pictures, which is what it's all about! For someone who never had anything but a point-and-shoot, the learning curve on the Rebel has not been as steep as I originally thought.

First, it met my price point for a first-timer's DSLR camera. I couldn't see myself spending >$1K to support a hobby that I was only beginning to explore. I likened my buying a higher-end prosumer or professional camera body (like a Canon 1D, a 40D or a Pentax/Samsung K20) to throwing the keys for the Maserati to a 15 year-old driver with a learner's permit. I know I could \"grow\" into a high-end camera, but why take a chance? My second rationale for purchasing the Rebel XSi was the functionalities built into the camera.

I really like this camera, it has plenty of options for more advanced users, but is simple enough that I can hand it to a novice and they can take nice pics right away (with the right settings). The optical image stabilization is very cool, really helps on indoors shots and etc (turn it off if u use a tripod tho b/c it will soften long exposure shots). I could be wrong about this but it seems as though there is no way to Auto focus while using the camera in \"Live view\" mode. But I don't really use that ever so it doesn't really bother me. 12 mp is very large, I've found the real limiting factor to clarity shifts from being how many pixels to how clear your focus is your lighting and what ISO / exposure / etc you have set. I compared this camera to the Sony Alpha 16mp and decided to go with this one because of the optical image stabilization and after reading reviews, the menu system on the Sony didn't seem as nice. Having never used the Alpha I can't really say the XSI is definitely better but I'm happy with my decision. The kit lens works well for many situations but can't really zoom in very far, so you will probably find yourself wanting something like the 50-250mm IS lens soon after you buy the camera if you are into things like nature photography etc where u can't get very close to the subject. I've taken about a thousand pics so far, the battery life is really good if u don't use flash constantly or leave the window on for extended periods it will last for many hundreds of pictures.\nOverall I would recommend this camera, it is nicely priced takes large very nice pics and the kit lens comes with IS so thumbs up from me."},{"reviewerName":"Thomas N.

I almost purchased the XTI model and now am glad I spent only about $100 more to upgrade to the XSI as it has SD memory card, image stabilization and is 12 megapixal along with the 3\" LCD display."},{"reviewerName":"Damon Shaw","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"WOW! You can't go wrong with the XSi!","reviewDate":"March 7, 2010","reviewText":"I've owned the camera for 1 week now, and WOW! This camera is simply incredible and the picture quality is outstanding!!! The kit lens that came with it is also impressive when used in bright/outdoor environments. (Some of my test outdoors pics and indoor pics with my window blinds open have been stunning.) However, the kit lens is a bit too slow for handheld photography in dark locations unless you use the flash.\n\nFor those of you new to photography, a \"slow lens\" is basically one in which the aperture does not open wide enough to collect the adequate amount of light in darker locations. Therefore, the shutter stays open longer until enough light has been collected. This also means that if your hand shakes, pictures snapped in dark enough settings will come out blurry. This is not exclusive to the XSi as slow lenses on any camera will produce similar results. If blurry indoor pics are not what you desire, you can correct this by using the flash, using a tripod, or...\n\nBUY A NEW LENS! The XSi can use ANY Canon EF/EF-S lens on the market...and this includes \"faster\" ones as well!! With faster lenses (ie, f/1.8), soon you'll be shooting like a pro indoors also!\n\nIn the end, when considering its wide range of features, customizable flexibility, and it's picture quality, I think any rookie or seasoned pro would be delighted with the XSi."},{"reviewerName":"DK","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Absolutely Thrilled!","reviewDate":"January 17, 2010","reviewText":"This is a remarkable camera. I took my first photography course in 1984. I used my uncle's Nikon, and was hooked. This cheap little SLR does everything I could ever have wanted in an SLR. Sure it's APS-C, but the pics look great and on my budget - it's a top notch camera. I recommend adding the el-cheapo 50mm 1.8 lens that canon sells for 100 bucks. It's worth it unless you can shell out some more for a wider/faster lens (I'm saving up for a 30mm 1.4). If you come from the old world of 35mm film SLRs you'll want to multiply the lens length by 1.6 with this camera - so a 50mm lens is actually a fair bit longer. You'll want 35mm or 30mm to get that old SLR prime lens feel (just like 1984). Do some research and you'll hear all sorts of complaining from the \"full frame\" snobs. For the world of us average joe amature photographer this camera is outstanding - don't worry about full frame. As too the longevity of the \"S\" lenses - just don't sink alot of money into them (which is not a problem because they are pretty cheap). If you want a really expensive lens - it'll undoubtably be full frame anyway (which will work just fine with this camera).\n\nGreat buy. Great camera. Nothing but positive things from me on this one!"},{"reviewerName":"Kathie","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Overall pleased","reviewDate":"April 9, 2009","reviewText":"The Cannon Xsi is my first venture into the world of the SLR/DSLR cameras.

I photograph everything, especially flowers. I have not learned how to take pictures using the manual settings, and look forward to doing so, however I am not fully happy with the automatic settings on this camera.\nMost of the time outside pictures are too light. My little Sony had better picture quality. The pictures look fantastic when I darken them up on the computer, but I really prefer to not have to manipulate my pictures digitally.\nI have two lenses. The 18-55, and the 55-250. I rarely use the smaller lens, but really like the zoom. In the future I will probably invest in a more expensive lens, but for now, the lenses I have are fine.

The images made up a 14.25\" x 11\" calendar and they were very sharp and clear, unlike images taken with my parents' old Point & Shoot camera. If you are coming from a Point & Shoot and frequently print images, you will notice a HUGE different in image quality and you will be very pleased with the change.\n\nThe live-view function can also be very useful if you do Macro photography. When taking photos close to the ground, squatting down and viewing the image through live-view on the LCD screen is a nice alternative to laying on the ground to look through the viewfinder!\n\nAnd those of you buying the camera with the kit lens, it's actually a decent purchase.

It does everything I need a camera to do, and any flubbed shots are my fault. The newer/upgraded versions of the Canon Digital Rebel are of course superior, but I don't feel any need to upgrade. The included software is OK, battery life is great for me, the video-out port can come in quite useful, and the USB port is as quick as I need. I sometimes wish that I could keep the orientation of portrait-mode shots in the display when I go back to them (so they fill the display), but that's a minor gripe. The auto white balance sometimes results in undesirable tint, so it's best not to depend on it too much.\n\nI got it with the kit lens, which although not a wonderful lens is a decent and very usable starter lens without major flaws, and a good value for the money. It was my only lens with image stabilization, and I quickly found it more useful than my third-party 28-200 for that reason. The worst thing about the kit lens is that it doesn't let the camera take shots at the quality of which it is capable, but for an extra $100, it's quite a bargain if you don't have anything else. However, if you can afford it, get a better lens and skip the kit lens. My Canon 50mm f1.8 (Mk I) makes for a very decent portrait lens. I just replaced the kit lens with the 15-85 EF-S IS lens as my main lens (and the cheap 55-200 EF-S IS for the rare long telephoto shot) but I'll keep the kit lens as a backup.\n\nI'm an occasional amateur photographer and not a true student of photography. I don't call myself a photographer, but people are generally very pleased with photos of them taken with this camera. It's nice to know that when I do take photos, I don't have to be an expert to get the pictures I want."},{"reviewerName":"Jerry","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"GREAT choice for my first DSLR!","reviewDate":"August 15, 2008","reviewText":"This is my first venture into buying a DSLR and I have a college budget so I made sure I was spending my money on the best camera possible. I had been reviewing DSLRs for months and months before finally deciding on the XSI, and I could not be happier with my decision! From the moment I took it out of the box I have been taking better pictures than I ever thought I could.\nI have some photography experience from a black and white photography class my first semester, but I am still quite green when it comes to the finer points of photography. It didn't at all matter with this camera. Right out of the box it didnt take me long to figure out the controls and which buttons did what. I love that there was a dedicated ISO button, white balance button, metering options button, AND shooting mode button. The worst thing is when you have a great shot that wont last long (think kids, animals, nature) and you have to dig through menus to get what you want. This camera eliminates that worry.\nThe lens that came with this thing is also much better than I expected in a kit lens. The image quality looks amazing while doing both very close up shots and landscape. I am not an expert on lenses, but I used one of my fathers lenses that cost several hundred dollars and there REALLY was hardly any difference in picture quality. Especially for a kit lens, I was quite impressed.\nOne last thing I love, THE LCD screen! This thing is HUGE and has very good image quality. It is great for reviewing your shot, right up to the fine details. It really makes it easier to see if you got the shot you wanted before you take it all the way back to your computer and see you screwed it up. As for the live view, I wasnt real sure when I would use it, but I found out the other day. There was a nest of hornets low to the ground and I sure as heck wasnt sticking my face down there. I convieniently used the live view feature to get the camera close and compose the shot while keeping my body in position to run :)\n\nReally the only thing that has annoyed me so far is how you have to smush your nose and face into the LCD when using the viewfinder. I am all the time having to wipe smudges off. But really, after having this camera for a week and all I have to complain about is smudges on the LCD? That really is hardly a complaint at all. I would recommend it for anyone from complete newbies, to people like me with a smattering of experience, to those that actually know what they're doing. This camera is amazing.\n\nAlso, to anyone interested. I posted some of my first first pictures on my Flickr account. These are pictures from a guy who has basically forgotten most of his photography class 2 years ago, and has had little time to do much photography at all. The XSI went a long way in covering up my inexperience. At least I think so :)\n[...]"},{"reviewerName":"David Deming","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Stunning Improvement Over Canon Point-and-Shoot","reviewDate":"August 25, 2008","reviewText":"I initially held off buying a SLR, not so much because of\nthe expense, but because I did not want to be confronted with\nthe complexity of the different control options.

The 7D is a great camera but the body only is $1600.

One of my primary lenses is the 100-400mm L which weighs 3lbs. I find talk of an unbalanced feel (with any lens) somewhat nonsense at least for my hands. For carrying around, hiking, birding, I wish the 7D was lighter like the XSi.\n\nI was too conservative at shooting only at 400 ISO and below.

It kicks the butt of the Tamron that I had on my XTi.\n\nIts currently June 2009, and as I write this I have to say I was thinking of getting an XS, but at the moment the XSi does not cost that much more, and Canon has a great deal at the moment where if you get the kit together with an Canon EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 II Lens for EOS Digital SLR Rebel XT, XTI, 20D & 30D Digital Camerasm IS lens you get $200 off of the purchase price, where with the ES you can get a different lens for $100 off, effectively making both combos about the same price on Amazon. Either way, if you are OK with having the extra hassle of changing lenses, this promotion makes it a lot more affordable to have a range of 18mm to circa 200mm than buying a mega zoom lens like I had before.

One favorite feature is the multiple-shot timer release. You can program the camera to take up to 10 consecutive photos after counting down from 10. This is a great feature for family portraits, where normally I would get up and run to the camera five or six times to re-release the shutter.\nThe image quality is great. Even when zoomed in, everything is crisp and beautiful. Navigating almost everything is a snap, though on some menus it only allows for vertical navigation even when there are rows and columns, which is frustrating.\nThe biggest annoyance I have with this camera is that after you take a picture or series of pictures, the camera previews the last photo taken on the VERY impressive screen. However, the firmware isn't in full playback mode. In other words, if you press left or right during the preview period, it brings up menus instead of other pictures you've taken. I would love to have the option to just have it in full playback mode instead, but it is not an option the firmware allows. I think it's rare that I'd rather be changing my settings to set up for the next shot instead of reviewing the work I've already done. And clearing the image is a simple matter of depressing the shutter halfway, so my question is, why isn't the option available to allow for fully automatic playback after image capture? I may be alone on this one, but I think there at least ought to be a choice.\nThat is my only real gripe, though. It is intuitive, user friendly and has plenty of little touches that make it a noticeably nicer SLR. The on-screen info is invaluable for shooting manual.

I am thrilled that I waited on the XSi. The quality is excellent! I purchased the XSi with the 18-55mm IS lens. The lens is a good walk around lens but I also purchased the 50mm 1.8 and the Sigma 70-300mm zoom. I tend to the leave the Sigma on more than any.\n\nThe XSi has nearly all the features of the 40d at a fraction of the cost. It's features are definitely well above the XTi and totally worth the upgrade. The 3\" LCD screen is great for the live view shooting or reviewing. The buttons are placed great and it's very easy to navigate.\n\nThe body itself is not as heavy as the 40d but also doesn't feel cheap and weak. It's a huge step up from my Canon S3 IS, however, I still love that camera and all it's power too.\n\nI have used the camera in numerous situations already and it prevails in all. Of course as with most, it does extremely well outdoors in light. It also exceeded my expectations indoors in low light. Even when I have had to bump the ISO to 800 or 1600, it performs wonderfully and there is very little noticeable noise. With my former cameras, I was never able to use high ISO settings because they were too noisy to fix with post processing. With the XSi, there is very little if any post processing work needed on the high ISO shots. It's wonderful for low light situations when you don't want that deer in the headlights flash look!\n\nAll in all, the XSi was totally worth the wait and the savings. The XSi is a fraction of the cost of the 40D and yet has nearly if not all the pluses of the 40D.

To call this a low end dSLR is a bit misleading. It's an awful lot of camera for the money and will shoot pro shots in the hands of a pro photographer.\n\nIt's a bit less durable than its pro siblings and the burst rate may be a shot slower but the XSi's lightweight composition and miniaturization could be considered an advantage. Having a camera handy to get \"the\" shot is half of photography and this kit with the addition of a Canon 55-250 IS I bought fits neatly in a Crumpler $5M Home bag.\n\nIf I had twice as much to spend I might consider a Nikon D90 or Canon 50D but if want to save a fortune and take great shots look no further than the XSi. I also recommend Ben Long's XSi Companion in addition to the excellent XSi manual."},{"reviewerName":"Sherif M. Latif","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Fantastic camera!! BUY THIS CAMERA!","reviewDate":"October 19, 2009","reviewText":"I can not say enough good things about this camera. From the stylish and durable construction of the camera to the quality of images this thing has really exceeded my expectations. I have owned this camera for over 8 months now and have taken it everywhere, trips overseas, weddings, family outings, dinner parties, birthday parties, you name it. It has produced stellar photos at every occasion and as you can tell by the different number of events I've been to the versatility of the camera is extremely impressive. You can quickly switch between taking photos of food, portraits, other macro shots, running water or fast action sports shots, they all turn out amazingly well. If you are going on a trip (I went to Greece and wanted to capture every moment perfectly) do not be cheap, I beg you, you will regret it. The one and only downside to this camera, which is perhaps a downside for all current generation dslrs is the size. It doesn't bother me at all because I know at the end of the day I will capture the most memorable shots. If you made it to the end of this review I have only one piece of advice for you: BUY THIS CAMERA!!! Actually, I have two, consider buying a lens with a little bit of zoom, the lens supplied with the kit gives you little to no zoom."},{"reviewerName":"D.

The control layout is simple, intuitive, and easy to get used to. I have ordered a Battery Grip which will extend my shooting time and will remedy the smallness of the camera (I am a big guy with big hands). I am still getting used to the camera but I can easily see it being used as more than just a backup. In my opinion this camera will function well as a primary or backup camera and the best part of it is the price. I wasn't sure I was going to like this camera because it is a Rebel but the more I use it the more I appreciate it. Why pay $4,000 or more for a \"Pro\" camera that has features that 99% of us will never use in two lifetimes when for $500.00 or less you can buy a camera that takes photos that are just as good and if it wears out, breaks, or is damaged you don't have to sell your soul to replace?

Had many cameras through my life ranging from Kodak 110 Speed Film required to 35mm to key-chained digital and countless toy cameras from my early days. Nothing compares to this camera. I wanted a digital camera that would be more than just a \"point and shoot\". A camera that allows me to set my own shutter and aperture settings to really get the shot I'm looking for. My mom has this camera, and ever since she got this one and would let me borrow it (sometimes for days on end), I knew it was the one for me. Easy to use, fun to learn, lightweight, wide range for depth of field shots, everything I was looking for. It nails the shot to receive clear \"forced blurred\" shots, crystal clear panned shots, as well as capturing the back-lit rainbow glow of water droplets from a pouring out garden watering can. I needed one for my digital photography class, and I'm glad I spent the extra money to get this one. If you're looking for a solid digital camera, look no further than the Canon Digital SLR Rebel XSi...you will need a telephoto lens stretching out to space to find any disappoints with it. And it ships very quickly, so you can catch that shutter bug in no time at all! I am now camera ready and very satisfied.

I thought my Xti was a great camera & it is but the Xsi is so much more! The increased image quality is worth the price alone. (See images below). Then when you add in the benefit of the improved & larger LCD, Highlight tone priority, excellent noise reduction, you have an exceptional value. Many pundits have listed some things as negatives that I feel are advantageous. Namely, the smaller size of the body seems to fit my hand very well & the light weight helps me carry it since I do a considerable amount of hiking & travel. Its easier for me to carry along with all the rest of my gear.

I'll be attending a photography class when I return home and the Canon XSI allows me to become more camera savvy in preparation for school. I LOVE this thing! Anyone who wants to get into photography professionally or just as a hobby, I HIGHLY recommend one of Canon's Rebel line. They have one to fit your shooting style no matter what it is.

I had a 35mm SLR in the past and was looking forward to a digital SLR. My first day out, I stuck to the 'Full Automatic' mode and reviewed the photos with some disappointment. While some were very nice, others weren't. The wide range for the auto focus points often stole the focus from a more distant object to a closer one. This was not easy to overcome in full auto mode. After reading the manual I selected 'Program Mode' and was able to program the auto focus point to just use the one I wanted. These photos came out much, much better. I also played around with some of the other settings and found that the close-up mode works very nicely. I have not yet played around with some of the more technical aspects of the camera, but it gives lots of room to grow. I'm very happy with the camera and glad I bought it.\nBottom Line: this is not a 'point-and-shoot' camera and should not be considered a high end replacement for one. This camera is great for a weekend photographer, or photo hobbyist. Just be prepared to spend some time learning the camera, the menus and settings. Then take a few hundred pictures and find its limitations and possibilities."},{"reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Waiting on 2nd replacement","reviewDate":"December 13, 2008","reviewText":"First camera has all kinds of dust on the mirror and/or the internal eyepiece optics.

The ones stuck in red are the most annoying. So this camera is going back as well.\n\nI will update when the third arrives. If that's bad I might just check out the 50D and if that's bad I guess give Nikon a shot.\n\nI understand a few bad pixels, my rebel XT has about 10-12.

Nekritz","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Canon Leads, Nikon, Others in the Industry Follow","reviewDate":"March 23, 2009","reviewText":"Canon has come a long way since it first turned the DSLR, the consumer digital version of 35 mm cameras, on it's ear about a half a decade ago. While competitors like Nikon and others have attempted to keep up, equal, or top Canon with a slightly better feature here or there, Canon still leads, the the industry follows. So the question when buying is this, do you want to buy the leader, or are you just a follower. Myself, personally, am not into imitation, and I've tried some of the other units including Nikon DSLRs, which their images always look hard, cold, and slightly off. Sony comes to bat with a lower entry price but not as much support sadly or features, Olympus as well. There's others of course, but really there's Canon and then everyone else.\n\nI like this camera, a lot, but have to deduct a half point as it's quality is even cheaper than the original 300D (Rebel XT), the plastics make it feel very toy-like. The other half a point is this camera has quite possibly the loudest shutter ever, next to perhaps those cameras that make the supposed shutter closing sound effect turned up to 11. I've shot with other consumer-grade Canon and Nikons that are much more quiet than this, it's really uncalled for on Canon's part. Perhaps their shutters are made of the same cheap plastic they're using for their cases. The 450D (XSi) is so loud, it borders on frustratingly annoying. Don't use this camera for even slightly hushed performances or places where some degree of silence is required, you'll only irk people. If shooting in even remotely quiet places requires no disturbance you may need to upgrade to a 5D or some such to retain the Canon quality edge and a quieter shutter.\n\nDespite this and removing a star, it has most if not many the features the higher prosumer level cameras have no blurring the line further between the $1K+ set and the sub $1K set of choices. In terms of bang for the buck, you're not going to get anything better. Besides, the true testament to taking good shots is in your glass, so if you're taking the route of investing in lenses and skimping a bit on the camera body, this is the camera for you! The images are stunning, no doubt about, it's almost hard, other than perhaps upping their body quality and shutter quality, what Canon could do better with the Rebel series, but I'm sure Canon will figure something out, and all the other poor imitations out there (Nikon, et. al.) will continue to play catch up."},{"reviewerName":"Ricks Cafe","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great starter DSLR","reviewDate":"June 6, 2012","reviewText":"As a \"starter DSLR\", I highly recommend this camera.

I've only had the camera for 1.5 months, and so far my only beef is with the kit lens that it came with takes \"pretty good\" photos when it comes to clarity. I know this because I also purchased the \"Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 II Camera Lens\". With this lens, the results are insanely better than with the kit lens. Photos are incredibly sharp, and with the aperture wide open at 1.8, you'll get really nice results with the blurred background effect that so many beginners (and experienced photogs) look to achieve.

I did extensive research before I purchased it and my decision to go with the Rebel XSi was mainly for performance, although price did factor in a bit. In the end I was torn between the XSi and the 40D, which I wanted mainly because it was supposedly better in low light. I was also afraid I would \"outgrow\" the XSi over time and would regret not purchasing the more \"professional\" 40D. I went to Ritz Camera to handle both of them and decided the 40D was just too big for me, even though I have larger hands. Plus the 28-135mm kit lens for the 40D was not as much of a wide angle as the kit lens for the Rebel, and with the deal on Amazon right now that gets you the 55-250mm lens for $100 off, it was too good to pass up. So I bought it and I love it. So far I haven't done much with manual mode, since I am still learning. I don't think I will ever outgrow this camera, unless I decide to become a professional photographer and do it for a living. This camera is easy to learn, perfect size to take everywhere, and Amazon has the best deal around. This is truly all the camera you need if you just want to get your feet wet in photography. The auto mode is good enough to get you using the camera until you graduate to the more advanced controls. You don't even need to understand exposure and white balance, the camera does all the work for you! One thing I had worried about is that the camera would feel too cheap with the larger lens attached. It looks and feels just fine. Canon has a wide selection of accessories and lenses that ensure that I can grow into my new hobby. None of the other companies seemed to offer as much for a competitive price.

In all regards, I'm exceptionally pleased with the new Canon. I was able to tell the kit lens improvement and the impact of Image Stabilization from the first time I used it, as it allows me to work in lower light and delivers clearer photograhs in every situation. The spot metering works very well, as does the increase in point-of-focus. I can definately see the increased resolution in my cropped enlargements, as well. The one feature I don't use (live view) could be a big 'plus' to people who prefer not to use viewfinders, but again, it's not something I use. Battery life (I use an external 430EX flash for most shots) has been far-above Canon's listed number; I often get over 800 shots on a battery using AF and IS.

The short of this review is that somewhere between professional and consumer, this is the most bang I could imagine for the buck. I did a lot of research and decided that the next logical step would be to just wait for the 5D MarkII if you actually NEED a better camera than this. Except for the stock lens, which is probably fine for a new shooter to learn and play, I recommend first adding the 28-135 IS USM, used on Craigs List or EBay. That's the lens that came stock with several full frame bodies, and can be had for under $250 in excellent condition. It's a great range extender and infinitely better for shooting people than the stock lens. (100MM is a very good focal length for \"people\" pictures).\n\nYou will also find that adding the 430EX or EXII flash with a Sto-Fen makes a huge difference, and that if you are on a very slim budget, the Gary Fong Puffer makes the on board flash much less harsh.\n\nSo for under $1200 (I bought a lot more gear than that so I can make this recommendation with some breadth of experience), the camera, two lenses, and maybe the added flash makes a GREAT casual photography setup.

To start out, just leave it in Full Auto mode and get used to it for a while. When you start getting comfortable where all the \"bells and whistles\" are, you can start getting adventurous. Canon supplies a VERY GOOD manual and it becomes your best friend at first. Yet it only took me a good day or two to really become friends. I had owned a 35 film camera (back in the day) so admittedly it was easier for me, but even novices will find this camera very appealing. The pictures are beautiful (I have the 18-55mm lens package), the colors spot on, focus clean and crisp. I bought the FD/EOS body adapter from Canon and am able to use all my old AE1 lenses, too! It's been a VERY painless transition for me.\n\nHIGHLY RECOMMENDED for anyone."},{"reviewerName":"Living Large In The South Bay","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great DSLR","reviewDate":"February 20, 2009","reviewText":"I'm definitely a novice photographer. I have had a Canon G3, which has been an awesome camera. But the wear and tear over the years was taking its toll on it and I needed to replace it. I decided I wanted a DSLR that I could use different lens' with. When the XSi came out I read all the reviews and finally bought it as a Xmas present for myself. This camera is great. With 12MP the resolution is very nice to have when cropping your images. Even with the kit lens the pictures are very good. My next purchase is going to be a telephoto that I can use for my landscapes.

I've always had a digital point-n-shoot for the longest time, but a new cannon point-n-shoot camera and a trip to Niagara Falls changed my mind. I was so impressed by cannon quality of camera and image. I became interested in doing semi-professional photography. So I looked into DSLR's.\n\nThis camera is a great camera. If you're just getting serious about photography like I am then I would highly recommend this camera. All the bad reviews I read here on Amazon made it seem like the camera had problems. But that's just not true, outside of defected product, the camera is good, it's the lenses you have to be careful about. The camera is comfortable to hold, not that heavy, and a heck of a lot better than the point-n-shoot you had before. It might take a while to get used to where all the setting buttons are, and moving between them quick enough. A lot of things are overwhelming with this camera when you never owned a DSLR or taken any photography classes. Such as where the buttons are, learning where all the features are, and the hardest is learning about aperture, shutter speed, and exposure. But don't let that deter you, if you take the time to learn then you'll be fine.\n\nPrice was great here on Amazon. It was the lowest price BY FAR that i saw while researching for NEW equipment.\n\nFor the lens it came with, the 18-55mm IS, it's a pretty good lens. When looking through all the reviews on here you'll see a lot of Auto Focusing problems. The thing is, if the lens can't auto focus, just switch to manual focus. You may ask though, \"how often would I have to do that?\". The answer, not very much. The only times my camera had auto focusing problems is with night shoots without a flash, and pointing it at the open sky. Sometimes you will get some shoots (depending on the scene and composure) that the camera wants to focus on something closer than your subject. Such as shooting through tall weeds or grass. Probably just want to switch to MF in that scenario like I do. I mean after all that's one of the primary reasons I got a DSLR, to have control of the focus. It's a good lens.\n\nOverall, great camera, great price, great quality. I'm happy I bought it."},{"reviewerName":"Luckemom","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Canon Rebel - Great camera","reviewDate":"May 3, 2010","reviewText":"I have had my Rebel for about a month and have really enjoyed it so far.

It was an awesome P&S, but it died after going through a whole lot of pain and agony that I put it through (sandy beaches, construction sites, oily garages). I decided to upgrade to a DSLR this time around and had been researching them for about 3-4 months. I was set on buying a D60 for a while and then the Rebel XS came out so I started comparing features and then saw that for a little bit more, I could get the XS which would have Live View, AEB and some other cool stuff. But at that point, the Xsi was only about 30 bucks away, so I dropped the cash and I must say I AM VERY HAPPY with my purchase. Nothing to really say about Amazon, their shipping was ridiculous as usual (came in exactly 2 days after I ordered - wish other places would mean 2-day when they say 2 day shipping). The camera itself is a dream to use. The Live View makes a big difference if you are sitting it on a tree stump or a tripod and composing with a little bit more stability. The camera feels solid in your hands and the lenses take a beating (actually hit the kit lens against a door once when turning around). The grips on the kit lens seem like plastic yet somehow feel rubbery - but in the end, my fingers love em and I haven't had any problems with prolonged contact while trying to get focus/zoom juuust right.\n\nThe rubber grips on the Xsi aren't exactly cushion-y, but the texture on the grips makes the camera body feel more secure in your hands (definitely worth the extra 30 or so bucks). You also get the proximity sensor for the LCD (turns it off if its close to your face) and the extra 2 MP (more cropping!).\n\nThat said, the camera strap leaves you wanting for something better. It looks nice, but its a little small if you are a big guy and its not padded at all so it feels a little tough on your neck - so factor in some extra spending money for a good strap and/or a good bag.\n\nIf you are buying this as a first time DSLR user, its a good investment (you can of course settle for something less... no problem with that, but you might as well drop the money for the best in this price range of DSLRs). Be prepared to get a LOT of bad pictures in your first couple of weeks with a DSLR as you get used to judging your shots on the review LCD after your take em, but after you do... the extra speed and better quality lenses are completely worth it.\n\nP.S. Don't underestimate that wide angle kit lens - you get some amazing shots, especially when you are dealing with landscapes."},{"reviewerName":"J. D.

Concepts like aperture, shutter speed, ISO, and how they relate do take some time to understand but once you get past that hurdle - all of the buttons just seem to make sense somehow. If you don't have a friend that can help you, I definitely recommend studying the basic mechanical concepts and reading up on composition tips - and then go out and shoot a ton of photos [just for fun] and try out some different things. Also, I haven't had any problems with the auto-focus issues that some have described - though now that I'm shooting in what's called Av or aperture priority mode, I changed my AF setting to use the center point instead of the all points mode and I get great focusing.\n\nP.S.

It's a big step up from the standard point-and-shoot cameras, which were starting to seem underpowered and short on features to me. I knew going in that the SLRs had a bit of a learning curve, and that was certainly the case here. But...if you want complete control over how you take pictures, you're going to need to put in the time to learn how to use the equipment.\n\nI bought the Canon EF-S 55-250mm f/4.0-5.6 IS Telephoto Zoom Lens at the same time as the camera, and have been very satisfied. It takes great pictures, and most of the functions are easy to see and use. There are two buttons on the front of the camera that I keep forgetting about during use, but I'm sure that will change as I get more comfortable with it.\n\nThe only problem I've had so far is taking indoor sports pictures; they either come out blurry or dark. It's not unexpected (action shots require a faster shutter speed and don't let as much light in; but letting in more light requires a slower shutter speed, making moving objects look blurry.) I'm sure more experience (or additional lenses/flashes...?) will sort this out.\n\nI also decided to get an additional battery (Canon LP-E5) because it takes about 3 hours to fully charge a battery; and the fastest SDHC card I could find (SanDisk 4GB Extreme - SDHC Class 10 High Performance memory card SDSDX3-004G-P31) so that I wouldn't be waiting for the camera to finish saving the last picture before being able to take the next one.\n\nOverall, it's a solid camera with great features and performance."},{"reviewerName":"Wayne","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Better than 35 mm; just short of 6x6 cm","reviewDate":"August 17, 2008","reviewText":"I have used 5x7 in., 4x5 in., 6x6 cm and 35 mm formats over the last 30 years, and have developed and printed all my work in my own darkroom (B&W and color).

Thanks to Amazon for delivery in under the time specified. And thanks to no arguments about stock outages and kit contents, which was so prevalent with several less-than-professional NYC camera outfits over the years, except for B&H Photo, a truly professional supplier.\nI don't think I can add much to what's already been said about this camera. The cost and the quality of this camera and PIXMA 9000 printer come in far under what my darkroom cost me many years ago--only deliver superior results--with no carcinogenic chemicals.\nI also own a Canon A620, which has delivered fantastic results for a small point-and-shoot camera that fits in your pocket.\nThe next step is to build up my Canon lens selection; I'm converting from being a previous Minolta (35 mm) and Mamiya (6x6 cm) user.\nOne word of advice: Don't skimp on the inks and use any cheap stuff other than Canon inks (or OEM inks for the printer you own).

For me, the form factor is a big plus, because I plan on lugging this onto an airplane along with my laptop in my carryon. I tend not to abuse my electronics too much, so the whole question of plastic body on the XSi vs. a metal body for the 40D wasn't an issue for me. Two points that favored the 40D: the continuous RAW mode is better (for baby's first steps, or sports) and the kit lens for the 40D is more versatile (a little wider than 35mm and out to 5X zoom, vs 3X zoom on the XSi kit lens). For me, it wasn't worth the extra cost (*edit*: with the instant rebate on the 40D right now from Canon, about $300 difference).\n\nI decided to splurge on a DSLR over an point-and-shoot because I always got frustrated with sunset and lowlight shots with my point-and-shoot (I have an Olympus Stylus 400). Either the picture would be blown out or too dark. Also, indoor shots without flash would often be too grainy because of the inferior image processing in my pocket camera. Much less of a problem with a DSLR, where I've been able to twiddle with the ISO and the aperture to get decent shots in all the above-mentioned situations.\n\nOverall, I'm very satisfied with this product. 4 stars because Canon doesn't include a SD card in the kit (c'mon, even my point-and-shoot came with a weenie card)."},{"reviewerName":"A.

I've spent the last year taking thousands of pictures and starting up a little photography business on the side.

I had a Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ28k (I think that is the model number) before this one and it was very easy to use! The autofocus was awesome. The \"modes\" were very easy to use and I could scout someone out 200 yards away and catch a moving shot with ease. It's not as easy with interchangeable lenses.\n\nThat being said...\n\nI don't like that you can't use the LCD screen to take shots if you're in an auto mode. You MUST be in a manual mode of some type.\n\nThe autofocus doesn't work or work well sometimes--especially if you're in manual mode using the LCD. I've had to manually focus or switch to the viewfinder and focus only to try and switch back without moving too much and knock it out of focus.\n\nI think that is pretty much the extent of the problems I've had with this camera.

In many of the mosques and museums a flash was not allowed or would not have been effective anyways but I was able to get some great shots anyways. The battery lasts a long long time too so you don't have to worry about running out of juice. I have no regrets of getting the camera."},{"reviewerName":"John D.

It has a tremendous amount of creative flexibility that really helps me to get the images I want. Although the camera has several preset modes that essentially diversify it's point and shoot ability, the creative zones are the life of the camera. If you aren't going to take the time to really study the manual, learn the equipment, and practice it's use - don't waste your money on any DSLR. Buy a nice point-and-shoot and move on. Having said that, it is nice to have the point-and-shoot mode for inexperienced spouses in addition to the creative zones. If you ever worked with a manual 35mm slr or even the older computerized slr, this is a fantastic purchase.\n\nA few small things to be aware of:\n\n1. You must purchase a top-end, super fast SD card if you want the camera to perform. Don't cheap out on the card or there's no reason to buy this camera. Be aware that the fast cards won't read in all card readers.\n\n2. The packaged lens has Image Stabilization built in. It's great for hand-held shooting, pushing your useable shutter speed 1 or 2 steps slower. It's absolutely horrible for tripod shooting. It will CREATE blur o long exposures if not turned off. Fortunately, the on-off switch is easy to access on the lens\n\n3. The camera feels kind of cheaply made. I've had zero quality problems and don't expect to, but the touchy-feely could be a little better. Of course, it shoots beautifully and I didn't buy it to pet."},{"reviewerName":"Timbus","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"best bang for the buck IMHO","reviewDate":"November 11, 2009","reviewText":"IMHO this is probably the best bang-for-the-buck consumer grade DSLR. Some folks complain about the image quality, but there are plenty of articles on the Internet telling you why looking at a digital photo at 100% zoom is not a sensible thing to do.\n\nCompare to XS, this one gives you 2M more pixels, 2 more AF points, and an insignificantly faster drive speed (3.5fps vs 3). If you don't think of these as important, then you should go with an XS to save about $100.\n\nT1i is more expensive, and for the extra $200, it gives you 3M more pixels, 3 higher ISO settings, video capture feature, but an even-more-insignificantly slower drive speed. If you have the money, go for it. but for me, I intend to use a DSLR as a DSLR for normal light-condition photo-shooting, so 3 more higher ISO settings and video capture feature don't mean nothing at all. 3M more pixels may be good, but 12MP is more than enough for me because I usually look at pictures on my monitor and rarely print them (even more rare to make large prints), so they will always be scaled down."},{"reviewerName":"Mark Hiatt","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great camera for newbies","reviewDate":"September 27, 2008","reviewText":"Having just gotten back into photography after a decades long absence I bought the XSi 4 months ago.

For the first time user, the full auto mode is perfect to use until you get time to read the manual and understand how to use the more advanced functions.

Daniels","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"1 year update","reviewDate":"March 28, 2010","reviewText":"Started my hunt for a dSLR only because I lost my Sony F707 P&S camera. I considered upgrading to a dSLR as I hoped to improve image quality over my other Sony and Nikon P&S cameras. I had many lenses from my film SLRs including several for my Canon 650.\nMany web sites later I was left with the idea that there are a lot of highly recommended cameras on the market. Was also overwhelmed with reports on features and menus with less emphasis on image quality.\nAfter experimenting with the T1i, and testing Sony's A500, A350, A230 & Nikon's D5000 and D90, went with the Canon XSi. Most all web reviews gave this the best image quality rating. Based on the same reviews I had some concerns about indoor photo white balance.\nAm still early in my journey with the XSi but VERY happy with it. The color saturation, contrast and dynamic range are spectacular. The photos, even on the sharpest in-camera settings, do not look \"digital.\" I've only slightly bumped sharpness and saturation and am finding very satisfactory jpegs. Will try RAW soon but am happy I don't need a lot of time for post processing.\nMenus seem easier than the other cameras I tried. Can get to most any setting with just a few keys. Can quickly get to custom settings as well. Doesn't have video but I barely used this on my previous cameras that had the feature. Anyway, I have a separate video cam for this.\nOnce I focused on image quality, the decision came easily and I've found a great camera well within my budget.\n\nUpdate from 6 months:\n\nHave had the pleasure of working with this camera now for around 6 months. Still finding the camera relatively easy to use but have to remember how to get to different features when in a hurry. Have added a remote control, excellent for being included in the photo. Have added a Tokina 11-16 zoom and found even better color saturation, clarity and drama with the wider angle.\nFound that standard settings tend to overexpose outdoor photos when in bright high contrast situations. Stopping down the AEB auto exposure by ~ 1 to 2 stops in these situations brings back a good balance with excellent results. Easy to do.\nAm more and more pleased with the ease of navigating the features on this camera. I'm finding I'm experimenting more. The great news is most of this can be done with great results at the camera and without need to sit at the computer.\nWill most likely add some additional lenses (2.8) as the camera is worthy.\n\nUpdate from 14 months:\n\nI've updated my lens collection with the Tamron 2.8 17-50. Over these months I've continued to see spotty AF performance from all of my lenses. When on, the photos are spectacular. When AF misses, are rather blurry. Manual focus delivered much better results.\n\nAnd so then I read the manual! I now have the Auto Focus set to select the middle cross-focus point and with a simple push of the toggling feature, I can select all focal points simultaneously. So far I've only experimented with just using the single center point. According to the manual and what I've read on line, this is the best setting especially for 2.8 lenses. The results have been amazing. Pushing down 1/2 on the shutter, the XSi focuses quickly on my subject when the center focal point is over the subject. Then, I reframe the picture and take it. All aspects of my test photos have been great! Will update this post as i get more experience with this new discovery. I have to admit I'm eyeing the new 7D but now am frankly finding that unnecessary. Combined with my new lenses, VERY good results."},{"reviewerName":"Rigor","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Good Camera","reviewDate":"January 21, 2010","reviewText":"After a long research, I have selected this camera which stands half-way between Canon's Rebel XS and the latest T1i model. After all, 12 megapixels is optimal. Besides, many features are quite rewarding for amateur. Unfortunately, I had to return this camera because, inlike many cameras I used before, I could not use that gorgeous 3\" LCD display for shooting in the most popular fully authomatic mode (could be enabled in special modes only).

Haus","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Downside and Upside","reviewDate":"September 7, 2010","reviewText":"The first two paragraphs are me trying to convince you NOT to get this camera. Whereas the last two paragraphs attempt the opposite.\n\ndon't get it\nThis is the first camera I have ever bought. I got it back in October of '09 and it has been wonderful. I still plan on using it for years to come. The buying process of an SLR is a tough one. You really need to research them, see what they can do, see what your needs are, and analyze whether it would be a good fit before buying one. Getting an SLR is an expensive decision. They can cost anywhere from 500 to 5,000 dollars (and you'll still need to factor in what lens' you'll want to buy). But I'm sure you already know all of this. What you need to know is whether the XSi will be a good match for your needs.\n\nIn short, my answer would be no, for just about everyone that's reading this right now. When I bought mine, video recording was still a feature found on the higher end SLRs and it wasn't all that great of an experience. Now SLRs are used to make absolutely stunning works of art using video features. And the XSi doesn't do that. It's a great camera, and I have no regrets in getting mine when I did, because I have been able to capture some amazing memories since then that I wouldn't have been able to if I had waited. I would advise that you spend the extra couple hundred dollars and get one that can make some movies. ISO is also a factor. On more modern cameras in this class you'll see ISO going up to 6400, whereas this one only reaches 1600.\n\ndo get it\nThis camera is a great choice for someone who has just discovered their passion for photography. Getting an SLR after you have had a point-and-shoot for years is like going from driving a bike around, to being able to drive a car. And this camera would be an excellent first car. It has many of the luxuries of other higher end cars yet it is still affordable when compared to what else is out there. If you get this camera you will be very pleased with it for the next five years. And keep in mind, it's not so much the camera body that makes great pictures, it's the lens. So if you start to feel limited by the camera, just get a new lens.\n\nSince this camera is affordable (compared to other cameras out there) you have room to go and spend a little more on lens from the start. The XSi is a wonderful starting point that will hopefully allow you to expand you photography in all kinds of ways you never considered. So if you're looking for a camera that will give you a good base that you can work up from, with a good value, I'd recommend this camera. The nicer more expensive cameras out there are great, but they still lack things that they should have in their featured features, such as stereo audio recording, more control over video recording settings, and auto-focus during video recording.\n\nEither way, just remember, getting a camera is an extremely personal thing. It should fit your needs for now, as well as five years from now. Cause I doubt you'll want to get a new SLR in just a year."},{"reviewerName":"Jim","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Survived the flood","reviewDate":"September 7, 2008","reviewText":"I agree with all the positive things said and I probably can't offer much more than that.

A few of my friends and some of my contacts on Flickr used this camera so I knew it could produce some really good photos! Well, I know it also greatly depends on the lens you are using and your own talent!\nFor a first SLR it feels very easy to use. It is very intuitive if like me, you had a Canon before. I had a bridge and it was very easy to go from the bridge to the Rebel XSi. The look and feel and the construction quality are great. It feels very robust and delicate at the same time. The buttons work smoothly.\nThe display is quite big and of good quality. The battery life is great so far. I've had the camera for a month and played with it every day and I only charged the battery once.\nIf I had to redo this though, I think I would not get the kit lens (18-55mm). I think I would get the body only and buy a better lens (better image quality, wider range). The 18-55mm lens is fine when you take pictures of landscapes in good light.

There are those that complain about image graininess at high ISO's on any camera but let's put it this way. You will only notice the graininess if you zoom all the way in on a picture and even then...so what. Who does that?\n\nThis camera is the fastest I have tested under $1000 in what I call from 'full autofocus to shutter release'. Both the Nikon D3000 and D5000 have a very noticeable delay just like a point and shoot if you push the shutter release from the top (even if already focused on an object). I know everyone says push it halfway to get set, but if you have very mobile children that isn't always possible. The XSI is literally point and click from a single full press of the shutter release. There is a small autofocus delay but nothing like those Nikon's. Even the Nikon D40 is faster than the newer 3000 and 5000 in that regard.\n\nAmazing quality and color.

I do still take some bad shots given my lack of knowledge in picture taking, but I'm able to get a lot of good shots as well. When set to Continuous shooting mode, the camera is very quick. Even when set to single-shot mode, the ability to get a number of pictures in a short amount of time is still fast - way faster than our P&S cameras. Also, we can actually take decent pictures of our children inside the house without the use of the flash and the picture quality is still excellent (to my perspective).\n\nOne of the nice things about this camera is it's ability to take pictures in RAW format (when using manual modes) and then being able to modify the pictures on the computer afterward using Canon's supplied software.

Though I was happy with the pictures my Konica Minolta Dimage Z10 made - especially outdoors, I dreaded to make pictures indoors or trying to capture moving objects on picture (now you see me, now you don't).\nSo I was contemplating for month which digital SLR I wanted and needed. Since this is my first camera of this kind and I'm merely a hobby fotographer, I didn't want to shell out several grands. But I wanted something that had enough \"oomph\" to it to justify the price tag. So I looked into the Canon Rebel XTi, Nikon D40, Olympus E30 and Olympus E50. The thing I didn't like about the Olympus was the fact, that it seems that I had to buy Olympus picture cards and they are kinda pricy.\nSo I went back and forth between the Canon Rebel XTi and the Nikon D40. Then I looked into the XSi and read the repords on amazon.com and other sites, compared both Canon cameras side by side. After a week or two I finally decided to spend a bit more but have a few more extras with my camera.\nAnd I had a lot of fun in the last few days with this camera.

With the new SLR, it was curious that the new 3\" screen was showing you the camera settings rather than the image you were shooting, like with point and shoot cameras. Only with \"Live View\" will you see the images on the screen as you photograph. It doesn't matter. Since it's a SLR, you view your shot through the viewfinder, which has elaborate information you can see. Frankly, the screen on point and shoot cameras were impossible to see and you could never tell what you were getting on them anyway. The SLR lets you know exactly what you are getting by looking through the lens that is taking the shot.\n\nI got a great deal on my 12.2 mpx EOS at Amazon, and I would urge anyone looking for a more serious camera than a point-and-shoot should jump in and make the plunge with this very excellent DSLR."},{"reviewerName":"D.

I still like it a lot. Amazing.\n\nIt's easy to use, the LCD screen is big and clear, it's quite light, and the packaged kit lens (18-55 IS) is good. It's not a top lens, but it delivers sharp photos across the zoom range. Default settings will give you great shots out of the box.\nThe 9-point auto focus is good most of times, but I found myself using the central point most often, even more so when using larger apertures (when right focusing matters most).\n\nFor under $700, this is the best DSLR you can find.\n\n* Pros and Cons *\nPros:\n- An easy to use, quick camera.\n- Intuitive menus.\n- 12 mega pixels.\n- Great pictures, sharp, good tones.\n- Small and light weight for a DSLR.\n- Live view mode to almost mimic point and shoot feel-it's slow though.\n- 3.5 shots per second-could be more.\n- Sharp kit lens for the price.\n\nCons:\n- Somewhat expensive compared to the Canon 40D (much lighter though).\n- ISO limited to 1600.\n- Relatively low fps.\n- Exposure compensation range limited.\n- Does not have video.\n\n* The competition *\nThe closest competitor is certainly the Canon 40D, which is a bigger, more professional camera. It has more options, higher iso, remote flash, higher shots per second rate, fewer pixels but a definitely tougher feel.\nI went for the rebel Xsi because I found the 40D too hefty.\nStill, if you really want a professional camera you should look at the Canon 40D.\nIf you have a bigger budget, you should also look at Nikon, I really recommend the Nikon D300, it's a really impressive camera.\n\n* Lenses *\nCanon has LOTS of lenses.\nIf you're tight on budget, you should get the 50mm 1.8, a great lens for portrait. It's a very sharp lens. You'll enjoy the 1.8 wide aperture that allows blurred backgrounds and sharp , all of this for under $100.\nIt's also a good start to get used to shoot with primes (lenses with a fixed focal length).\nThe 18-55mm kit lens is often paired with the Canon 55-250mm IS lens to give you an almost 14x zoom (13.9), this Canon 55-250 is a very good telephoto lens if your budget is under $300.\nIf you don't want to change lenses, Canon just released the 18-200 IS and it comes highly recommended so far.\nThe Sigma 18-200 OS is good too. It's cheaper and it's been in the field for longer."},{"reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Easy to use","reviewDate":"April 2, 2019","reviewText":"The camera was a great buy"},{"reviewerName":"David Conklin","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great value!","reviewDate":"June 28, 2018","reviewText":"Wow!

If you don't, but want to make the adjustments yourself (the way it used to be done) then you can do that as well. If the latter, the instruction book is very clear on how to do that even if you don't know about f stops, shutter and film speed.

I bought (and returned) two. The \"only\" problem was the quality of the photos. For portraits, the quality was magnificent. However, for landscape shots the quality was poor and out of focus. The first camera was the worst of the two. I took many pictures that turned out substandard. The one I remember best was a scene overlooking a town. The houses in the town were all a blur. My girlfriend took the same picture, standing next to me, with her [...]point and shoot camera. The houses were all nice and sharp in her photo. The second camera was better. The portraits were, again, magnificent. However, for distance shots it was slightly inferior to my Canon G9.\n\nI know that this camera had great professional reviews (see [...] and great reviews by users ([...]I have no doubt this camera has served admirably for many people. However, I can only write about my personal experiences (I am not a novice photographer and I shot in both RAW and JPEG). It is not only me.

Or read the few bad reviews on Amazon.com (many of these are about focus) or look through the discussion forums on [...] Other Canon cameras (including other Rebel models) don't have these complaints.\n\nI very much want to give this camera five stars since it is very, very nice, but I can't due to my personal experience. I do not dispute the five star rating other customers have given this camera - if they have had no focus problems, their ratings are correct. For me, I am going to wait for the next generation of the Rebel series.\n\nUpdate 2 March 2012: I gave up the Canon Rebel and bought a Pentax K-30 DSLR which I absolutely love. However, when selling off my used lenses for the Rebels, I found out that the replacement for the kit lens I had bought (a Tamron 17-50) was defective. It was that lens, and not that camera that caused all the focus problems. Since the Rebels were nice cameras and I can no longer blame them for having focusing problems, I changed the rating to 5 stars.

I liked taking pictures but I never was \"into photography\" until I got this camera. My wife used to have a film SRL and kept wanting a digital one, which eventually led to this purchase. No regrets whatsoever. I have had the camera about 9 months now.\n\nUses: I use this camera most frequently to capture moments from get-togethers with family and friends. It's great for taking pictures of children who don't sit still. I've taken lots of pictures of my dogs. It makes them look sweeter than I think they are. : ) The majority of my pictures are indoors but I take a large number outside too. I'm the official family photographer now.\n\nChildren: It is great for capturing personality and expressions of my young daughter. Often, I just point the camera at her and hold down the shutter release and let the continuous mode capture all the poses and expressions. I have gotten so many priceless pictures that never would have happened with a point and shoot (P&S) camera. Family and friends are always appreciative of me taking great quality pictures of their children as well. My pictures with this camera are usually better than what they have taken.\n\nVS P&S: Too many times, I would grab my P&S, see a photo op, and take the picture only for the moment to be gone by the time the picture was actually taken. The speed of this continuous shooting mode on this great. The FPS of continuous mode is one of the main points that would get me to upgrade to a \"nicer\" camera. Lack of money and time (to really learn the DSRL) are really the only reasons to stick with a P&S.\n\nVS Video: I think it is a personal preference thing but I prefer great pictures to video. Video is good to capture moments but there is just something very special about a great picture that I do not get from watching a video. There is a reason for the saying \"a picture speaks a thousand words.\"\n\nRAW vs JPEG: I tried going RAW for a while but every time I showed my wife the RAW I had tweaked in Photoshop Elements vs. the JPEG of the same shot, she almost always picked the dang JPEG so I'm almost always shooting the highest res JPEG these days. I do still plan to do more RAW in the future though. RAW gives you more options but takes more work.\n\nKit lens VS others: Hmm, this is always an interesting debate. I'm a visual guy but I'm not always the most detail oriented. I rarely use the kit lens though I like the focal length it provides for indoor pictures. My most often used lens is the Canon EF 50mm f1.4 USM prime lens. I'll be writing a review of that in the future and posting some pictures too. I'm thinking about getting a high end zoom in the next 6 months to a year. Basically, I want the quality and speed of that prime but the convenience of a zoom. That combination costs about a grand. I just have not decided to let go of that much money since I'm not a professional and do not receive any money for my pictures. I got the EF-S 55-250mm f/4.0-5.6 IS Telephoto Zoom as part of a package deal when I got the XSi kit. I really like the focal length, especially for outside nature pictures. 250mm on this camera (1.6x crop factor) really reaches out. Having said that, it still makes me want more at times. There are some wildlife (mostly bird) pictures that I wanted that needed some extra reach. I got some pretty good zoo pictures with it. This camera's resolution with take advantage of the high end lenses so my wish list has gotten quite pricey.\n\nLens wish list - these are all expensive, maybe even crazy-expensive for an amateur:\nEF 100mm f/2.8 Macro USM (macro photography is just fascinating to me)\nEF-S 17-55mm f/2.8 IS USM or the EF 24-70mm f/2.8L USM Standard Zoom (both have pros and cons)\none of the EF 70-200mm L series lenses\nlonger reach 300mm-400mm lens\n\nEase of Use/Quality of Pictures: I am combining these two qualities because basically, with a DSLR, it comes down to how easily can you take really good pictures. I think it is a combination of luck and skill. You are not going to magically start taking the best pictures of your life just because you buy an expensive camera. It still takes work. I have a couple of coworkers who got a Nikon D90 around the same time I got this XSi. They have taken good pictures, but both have make comments that it is hard to take tons of really good pictures with a SLR unless you spend time learning about the camera, photography concepts, and practice. I think this is a great camera, but that 5 star rating doesn't mean it hands awesome pictures to you. I've seen quotes of the % of \"keepers\" that good photographers expect to have from a photo shoot. It isn't a very big number. I just want perspective buyers to know that it takes some effort to get consistently great pictures out of any SLR, especially the more varied the conditions and setting you are photographing.\n\nAccessories: I've spent more on accessories than the price of the camera. Is that required, no. But it sure helps. : ) That is a main reason why I'm glad I didn't start out with a more expensive camera. It leaves money for other goodies. I got two lenses in addition to the kit one, a backpack, remote, tripod, several books, Photoshop Elements, and a couple of SDHC cards. Oh yea, I spent a pretty good chuck of change on the Speedlite 580EX II Flash too. It's great but can be harsh and startling to those being photographed if you aren't careful. I'm trying to take more natural light pictures instead of flash, hence some of my lens choices.\n\nI hope this long review was helpful. I have really enjoyed this camera and starting photography as a hobby. It has opened up a whole new world to me."},{"reviewerName":"J.

Right out of the box, I've taken some amazing photos. I've literally used it every single day since purchasing and I couldn't be happier with my decision to buy the Canon Xsi 450D. A couple of my friends purchased this camera and after just briefly seeing some amature photos they had taken, I realized this was the camera I have been looking for. I've always been a big fan of Canon products and this delivers. The camera is light weight, sturdy, and easy to use. The only downfall, which is so very minor, is the kit lens doesn't offer much zoom, so I will be purchasing the Canon 55-250mm telephoto zoom lens to add to my collection. Like I said before, this is a very minor drawback. The kit lens is great besides not being able to zoom in on something far away. I will be posting photos along with my review soon =)"},{"reviewerName":"Chris Tow","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Good DSLR camera","reviewDate":"December 10, 2013","reviewText":"We bought this camera as a supplement to our point and shoot camera.

Prich","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Be aware of potential issues","reviewDate":"October 22, 2008","reviewText":"I purchased this camera as an update to an earlier mid-range ultrazoom I had - which was also a Canon. I have been a Canon fan for quite a while. My daughter had bought an earlier version of the digital Rebel and loved it, and convinced me it was time to upgrade.\n\nOn the first day I got the camera, I shot a few pictures and then transferred to a 75-300 lens I bought together with the camera and shot a few more pictures. After about the 3rd shot, the camera froze up. I shut it down and restarted it, and it took off fine. Over the next couple of weeks, it started to happen more and more frequently, and I could see an ERR99 on the back display, or in the viewfinder. I went online and found out this had been an issue not only with this Rebel but earlier versions as well. Recommendations said that it was an issue with contacts on the lens, and to try an eraser on the contacts. Initially this seemed to work, but within a few days I had to try taking the battery out as well. Eventually the camera totally locked up. I sent the camera to Canon under warranty and they have returned it - in perfect working condition. Several days in now, and no return of the problem - but they did not say what the issue was and there was no further information to be had. I am happy because it is working fine now, but I of course wonder about a repeat issue after the camera is out of warranty. I was impressed with their turn around time - they had the camera back to me in just a little over a week after I sent it out, and overnighted back when it was finished. It does take very good pictures - but an IS lens really improves everything - the original lens works great, but the zoom lens doesn't have the IS feature. It's ok, but it's not great.\nOverall, I think anyone upgrading to this midrange SLR digital will be happy - but be aware there are some issues with them and I haven't read anything from Canon to indicate the nature of the problem, or how they resolve it."},{"reviewerName":"Elizabeth Cunnane","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great Camera","reviewDate":"May 12, 2010","reviewText":"This camera is amazing.

Amazon was great too, shipping was super fast as always, tried to use another company to get the camera, price was super great, too good to be true honestly and then later found out it was because there wasnt a battery included.

Every now and then, however, I need to bring a smaller camera with me for whatever reason, and this is the one. Also, like a lot of pros and semi-pros I need to have an APS-C body in order to use the cult-followed Canon EF-S 10-22mm lens that only works on APS-C boides such as the Rebels.\n\nIn fact Rebels have been the one I go to to fill those needs for a few years now. A lot of semi-pros and pros criticize the performance of these cameras and/or the perceived weaknesses in ergonomics, size, and available functions. Is this a $1000 camera body? No it is not. Is this a $2600 camera body? No it is not. Is this a $6999.99 camera body? No it is not. I am hammering that point home because some people insist on comparing the Rebels to cameras like that. The comparisons are fine as long as price is factored in; if you leave price out of the equation then yes, this camera will likely lose out to a body costing more than a grand.\n\nThe following are some my random thoughts on this camera; I am not going to cover everything because others have done that well enough. I am going to address the issues important to me, a semi-pro photographer who sometimes needs to travel light.\n\nISO performance (this is most important to me in any camera for any price):\n\nISO 100: Outstanding\nISO 400: Great (and professionally competent) except for higher than desirable noise in the darkest shadows. Even shooting RAW and carefully post-processing, you will probably need to leave the shadows alone and not bring them out too much. I am nitpicking a little here for the sake of being thorough in the review; it is not by any means a terrible or \"deal-breaker\" level of noise in the shadows.\nISO 800: Usable for sure and better than expected, but noise certainly is apparent at this level--or rather the effects of noise reduction are apparent--and the in camera noise reduction is aggressive enough that some detail and sharpness is lost as a result of cleaning out the noise. Certainly usable but best at smaller sizes (8x10 or smaller) when printing and viewing.\nISO 1600: To me it's out of the question. I do have a higher standard than the average consumer as a semi-pro, so keep this in mind. I would use this setting only in such a dire situation that ISO 800 would be completely unusable. The noise reduction in ISO 800 is too aggressive, but it does result in the elimination of a great deal of noise. It seems they didn't even bother in ISO 1600. There is noise all over the place in ISO 1600. I haven't used a camera that I can remember that had such a huge difference between ISO 800 and ISO 1600. So, bottom line, IMHO you should stay away and only use in a pinch. I can't see printing anything larger than 4x6 with this setting. If that's your bag then you will probably be fine.\n\nI do want to say regarding my opinions on the ISO handling that I did not buy this camera for high ISO performance. If you are planning on doing that I would think twice. Is it better than the Rebel, Rebel XT, and Rebel XTi? Certainly. Does that make it a good performer at high ISO? Not necessarily.\n\nI do the vast majority of my shooting between ISO 100 and 400. I use fast lenses and I typically shoot during the day. This is especially true of the times I am using this camera. I don't go to a camera like this for high ISO performance. For that I grab the 5D. I go to this camera for the few times the 5D is not best for the situation. This camera delivers an outstanding image quality at ISO 100-400 and a usable one at ISO 800. To me this is all that matters. a 12MP DSLR with outstanding image quality for a little over $500 is what this is. You throw a nice Canon lens (nicer than the kit lens) on this and you have professionally acceptable results. I wouldn't use this camera if it didn't provide those results.\n\nThe only way the aforementioned 5D will outshoot this is (in an image quality respect) is if you are making enlargements or shooting higher than ISO 400. If you are using good glass, shooting RAW, and setting the ISO manually (which is what I do) this is an awesome camera. I don't care if anyone says otherwise, either. I don't have to--and won't--argue that point because I've seen the results.\n\nNow, if you have never used a Rebel I do have to inform you that it is much smaller than the 20D, 30D, 40D, etc. bodies that you may or may not be used to. It is much harder for me to keep a good grip on this body than, say, the 40D. Again this is OK with me because I am not buying this for ergonomics. Again, I am buying this for value. Price combined with performance is how this arrives at a place of value. I need to keep repeating that because for some reason people always feel the need to compare cameras that are incomparable. If you are looking for the best performance in a DLSR combined with best price, it is my firm opinion that this is the camera.\n\nLastly, I want to say that if we are talking strictly image quality and nothing else like ergonomics and construction, IMHO the IQ from this camera is just as good if not better than the mildly overrated 40D. Given the vast difference in price of the two--almost 100% different actually--unless you are an ergonomics stickler I think the decision is a no brainer. You buy this and save the $500 for better glass, or just save the $500 for no reason other than saving $500 is cool. What I am looking forward to doing down the road is comparing the IQ from this to the IQ from the 50D. Again it equals or bests the 40D if we are talking strictly IQ. I returned the 40D last year after using it for 2 weeks. It just wasn't worth the price. The 40D to me is simply a Rebel XTi (XTi; not XSi) with better ergonomics."},{"reviewerName":"J. A. Hovanec","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"does the job","reviewDate":"February 3, 2010","reviewText":"After a lot of research, customer satisfaction posts, reviews, etc I decided on this camera. I am a typical middle class working stiff. I can afford what I can, and wanted a quality camera for a modest price. This is it. Takes great photos with really good battery life. The image stabilizer feature is worth its weight in gold. Its not a miracle worker, but really helps on the \"camera shake\" that you get with some shots.\n\nBut it should be noted that no camera can take great pictures without the \"taker\" practicing. While the little \"purse\" camera is almost idiot proof, this one is not. You have to play with it and enjoy it. It doesn't use film, has a warranty, and a ton of settings, so why not experiment with it. I take the same photo with a dozen different settings and then see what the photos look like. Practice makes perfect, and it doesn't cost you a penny to do it.\n\nThere are some great books printed for this particular camera that are a must. Check the reviews here on Amazon and make your choices.\n\nAs you will find out by checking the various sites, there are accessories that will cost you thousands of dollars if you get carried away. My suggestion is \"stick to the basics\".\n\nAnd one more VERY important aspect to picture taking. \"A great photo is in the eyes of the beholder\".\n\nThe \"pro\" photographer that lectures for an hour about everything that was done wrong when he looks at a photo taken, may be telling that to a person that thinks the photo looks \"perfect\".\n\nGreat camera with a lot of settings to get you in the ball park."},{"reviewerName":"Leslie B.

Being a newbie, this was well priced and as easy to use as point and shoot. The pictures come out great even with low light. It really puts the Casio Exilim I have to shame. I definitely recommend this to everyone but there is a downside to this.\n\n1) Unlike modern point and shoots, this can't record video. Not really a big deal but it's a nice feature to have while on vacation.\n2) It took me a very long time to figure out how to get the camera to work in live view mode (use the screen to shoot). Considering it was one of the bigger selling points, it was weird it was so hard to figure out.\n3) Focus in live view mode isn't by holding down the shoot button 1/2 way but you have to push another button instead. Weird.\n4) Live view mode doesn't work in automatic modes. Like I said. Kind of weird.\n5) When traveling, it's REALLY big. I do mean REALLY big to carry around. I didn't realize it would be so cumbersome to carry but seriously the advantages of having great clear shots outweighs the man purse you have to lug around.\n\nWhen buying this camera, I do suggest a couple additional items.\n1) UV haze filter. For $7, it would protect the camera lense from being scratched.\n2) LCD screen protector. With such a large screen, don't get it scratched.\n3) LensePen to keep the camera clean.\n4) Holster bag to carry the camera and all the toys\n5) Extra battery. This battery lasts forever but you'll need another one eventually.\n6) If you like putting yourself in the shots, buy yourself a tripod and a remote control."},{"reviewerName":"Kim Johnson","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great Camera","reviewDate":"January 27, 2010","reviewText":"The last camera I bought was almost 11 years ago.

It takes great pictures and the colors are vivid WHEN THE AUTOFOCUS work properly. I would get 6 shot of unfocused pictures out of 10. I tried all the settings (Manual, P, ATV, AV, A-DEP) and the results are the same. One would think that by setting the camera to AUTO MODE you would at least get consistent good pictures but it's not the case. Also, there is this BUSY indicator which appears for no valid technical reason. I was taking picture of the San Francisco BAY at around 4:30 pm. It was slightly cloudy and the sun was just peeking through the clouds. I set up the ISO to 200, shutter speed to 1/1250 (I was also focusing on the small waves and that's why I went for the faster shutter speed) and sometimes to 1/50 , wb to daylight, and also cloudy. There were a several shots where I got the BUSY indicator when I didn't even use the flash. The BUSY indicator delays your shooting significantly, and it performs like a P&S camera.\n\nI have P&S digital cameras (sony, panasonic, and Canon) and their autofocus are dead on.. no problem whatsover. For a DSLR, although entry level, one would assume that the autofocus will be accurate on automode. I am dissappointed with this camera. I think canon cameras are great unfortunately, I probably got a defective one. I also ordered the Nikon D40 last month. It was a great camera but focusing was bad as well. It is just frustrating.

I am a novice who wanted to jump into photography with a decent camera without spending a lot of money. The Xsi takes great shots, has a decent feature set, and for the $560 I paid for it, is an unmatched deal. I tried out cameras in person in various stores, and the Xsi is much more comfortable to hold for prolonged periods of time than comparable Nikons (for me). If you have been waiting to get a DSLR, I would highly recommend endulging in an Xsi. You will be glad you did."},{"reviewerName":"Rob and Laura","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"First Digital SLR...","reviewDate":"September 7, 2008","reviewText":"This was my first DSLR. Having only known point and shoot cameras this was an excellent next step. Easy to use, light enough to carry around though can get a bit heavy after awhile. The lens and features were great too. I've since added a 70-300 mm 1:4-5.6 IS USM lens and makes a great package. Picture quality is outstanding - didn't anticipate the significant improvement between a point and shoot and this camera.

Since its debut in early 2008, this Canon XSi has always been rated at the very top of cameras of its class by every magazine I've read, including Popular Photography, Digital Photography Review, PC World, Camera Labs, etc. It's turned out to be a big disappointment and I almost returned it to Amazon. The color sometimes seems to be washed out even though there's no over-exposure. My now-sold Nikon D70 is much better than this cheap camera.

It only cost a little bit more than higher end point and shoot cameras, but the level of artistic rendition that can be achieve from this camera is well worth the extra cost. If you like taking still images buy this camera instead of wasting your money on a point and shoot. Highly recommended.

Great machine. Feels just about right in terms of weight, size and handling. I do miss the variety of functions the S5 had but I guess that comes at a price for better image quality, interchangeability of lenses and versatility of shooting.\nI could have technically waited a month more for the T1i but I decided not to spend 200 bucks more for having a movie feature in my SLR. I am looking forward to buy some more lenses (50 mm prime to start with) and take some cool pics.\n\nOverall, I am pretty satisfied with my purchase. The reason why it is not a 5 star purchase is that the kit, did not surprise me with its performance (which may be just because I am new to DSLRs).\nIt is sure the best purchase for an entry level feature packed DSLR."},{"reviewerName":"J.A.","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Super Happy with this Camera","reviewDate":"December 13, 2010","reviewText":"This is a great entry level camera.

The camera performs very well in all preset modes . Its a very nice camera if you are just stepping into the SLR photography realm. I specially liked the High ISO performance of the camera. One thing that i was concerned about though was the Av mode which had problems calculating the Shutter speed at low light and the images were blurred. Not sure if the kit lens was the issue or if the issue is with the Av mode itself. Hence i had to use either Tv or M mode. Preset modes are great .

However, I prefer using my Canon A1 film camera. Digital is great, but I wish this camera had the ability to take photographs as well as my A1 SLR. No way, it just can't be done. But for a digital camera for under $700, whereas mine included the 50-250mm zoom lens and the standard 18-55mm, so I received even a better deal. I do like the camera, I just can't seem to get the quality pictures I think it should deliver. It could be me and not the camera. All of the whistles & bells are fantastic, including the battery life. I use my old Canon Speedlite 199a flash on this camera. Its works perfectly. No problems. Oh, and I called Canon technical support prior to using this older flash unit because I had read where some people thought it could damage the camera, which it cannot.

The supplied lens is the downfall for me, the image quality is okay but the \"feel\" is distressing. I know the lens is a trade off, offering a lot for the price but putting an \"L\" lens on the XSi is a real eye opener, brings the camera to life. Were I to do it over I would easily still buy the Rebel XSi body but would purchase a good prime lens (fast Canon 35 or 50mm) and give up the benefits of the zoom. Soon after purchasing the Rebel XSi kit I added a Canon 135 f2 L and was rewarded with some stunning photos with great \"pop\". While putting a high quality (and high priced) lens changes the XSi from a good camera to a great camera the reviewed lens/body combination is a great move up for most of us and priced well. Battery life is amazingly good and the RAW image files are supported by many software packages.

The reason I gave the display only 3 stars was simply that I don't see the image before I shoot it and can't get everyone into the photo on the picture. I am sure if I read through the book there is a solution to this, but I just haven't done so yet.\nI love this camera and can't wait to see all that it is capable of in the future."},{"reviewerName":"S.

Don't get me wrong, the camera itself is really great and it has a ton of features, but that's just it. I have never been more than a point and shoot kind of guy, but one day I decided \"hey, why not buy a more advanced camera and get into photography?\" The problem was that I know next to nothing about photography other than that the camera had to be pointed at what you want a picture of.\n\nI discovered quickly that SLR cameras are not for novice users. The Rebel XSi does have an automatic mode, but that really isn't where the value is with a device like this. I eventually wound up buying a \"for dummies\" bood about the XSi to help me out, but I slowly lost interest and realized that I don't have the time or patience to get into something like this. I don't know if this will be a helpful review for more experienced shutter bugs out there, but if you have no intermediate photography experience, it would be wise to give this a second thought.\n\nShame on me for blowing so much on a camera with no experience, but I really did enjoy the camera while I owned it. I know it's in the hands of someone who will get more use out of it now though."},{"reviewerName":"Nikki","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Wonderful!","reviewDate":"May 3, 2013","reviewText":"I have been waiting for camera for awhile.

We managed to transfer one, but that was it. Other images simply will not transfer. The software doesn't recognize, and refuses to connect to, the camera. Even after reloading the software and trying on a different computer. The Canon help line was absolutely no help! NONE!!! They insist it must be a \"computer problem\" as \"no one else has ever had this problem\".\n\nConsequently, we must take the memory card to the in-store developer-kiosk and transfer images there, which requires two trips.\n\nThe camera is great and does everything she wanted, but the software and the Canon help desk are worthless!"},{"reviewerName":"Jack E.

What I shall try to address though is whether this is the right one for you: You can fall into one of the three categories - (a) a beginner who wants to create the beautiful pictures of an SLR but has no interest in going into its technical details ever (b) A beginner who has just entered the world of SLRs and intends to learn its intricacies before moving onto the big league (c) An intermediate who knows the technical details but wants a better SLR compared to previous versions like Nikon D40 or Rebel 300D.\n\nIf you belong to bucket (a) this is a good camera, but the Canon 1000D or Nikon D60 should save you some money. If you belong to bucket (b) this is the perfect camera by all means. I fell into this category when I bought it an year back and must say I have had no complaints. You might want to consider the Rebel 500D/T1i now though - based on the price difference(Amazon keeps changing the price of this camera) you will get a Digic 4 processor & the video capability (15 Mp vs 12 Mp is a non issue).\n\nIf you belong to bracket (c) & are very serious abt moving up the SLR ladder then buy the Canon 40D or 50D. I have handled the 50D and see a remarkable difference between pictures from that and Rebel 450D. I have now reached a point where the Rebel 450D & the lens are proving to be the bottlenecks to my pictures. Dont get me wrong, I have seen & taken remarkable pics from this camera - but would rather buy a Canon 50D now. Its sensor & USM lens really do stand out.\n\n& for those of you who do not fall in any of these 3 brackets & know the difference between active & passive focusing system, you shouldnt be reading a review for the Rebel series cameras at all!"},{"reviewerName":"jenny","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Five Stars","reviewDate":"September 23, 2015","reviewText":"I love the processing speed of this camera.

Marfell","rating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Has potencial, but its AF is not soooo good","reviewDate":"October 4, 2008","reviewText":"I bought this camera after graduating from an old Olympus C-5050 point and shoot camera. The C-5050 offered almost every DSLR feature except for bulb, which I need for my Astrophotography. After spending several years understanding the manual features of the C-5050 I thought is was time to graduate to my first REAL dslr.\n\nAfter shopping around testing out various models such as the Olympus evolt, Nikon D80, and this one, the Canon XSi, I found the XSi was the best choice for the money, features and quality (as noted in all the reviews online). I thought I made an informed decision and couldn't go wrong with all the research I did.\n\nAfter I got the camera out of the box and set it up I began my many adventures testing it with long exposure light painting, landscape photos, and close-up portrait photography. One thing began to emerge as I used the AF feature on the camera. I couldn't for the life of me get the thing to focus on anything past 10ft. I always had to use manual focus to get the pictures the way I wanted them. I shot in all AF modes: AI Focus, One shot and AI Servo without any luck. I studied the 9-point wide-area AF feature very closely to be sure I wasn't the cause of all my problems, but still the problem AF persisted. After taking about a 1000 actuations, I gave up. BACK TO AMAZON WITH YOU!\n\nAlthough most of my photography will be using MF, there will be those times when I need to take a quick photo of something that rushes past me and I just need to pull out the camera and shoot. This issue eliminates that as a choice, which is not a trivial thing.\n\nBTW: I tested the camera using two Canon IS lenses, the 28-135mm and the stock 18mm-55mm IS lens. Both had the same issue with focus. Below you will find two photos. One I took at short distance and the other with the oak tree at infinity using AF.\n\nAfter 10 days of frustration, I returned my camera to the good folks at Amazon. I really wanted this camera to work and had high expectations.\n\nUpdate:\n\nShortly after returning my XSi and upgrading to the 40d, a friend on a whim bought the XSi. He and I spent several days on the trail snapping some shots to see how his new camera performed. Out of 30 or so shots, only about 15 were acceptable. He used my Manfrotto tripod (rock solid), 17-40mm L, 50mm prime 1.4, 28-135mm USM, 100-300mm USM to no avail. again only about 50% of the shots were unacceptable. So again, back to the store it went.\n\nSince I've migrated to the 40d I've never been happier. It does everything a midrange DSLR should do and NO auto focus issues. Before you consider buying the XSi, really, really think about spending an extra $100 dollars or so and get the 40d. You won't be sorry.\n\n[...]"},{"reviewerName":"Lori A.

But is complete value for money if you are looking to get started in photography, which I believe is more about taking and framing a picture with good composition skills. Once that has been accomplished you can aim for better equipment. But all said, it IS a DSLR.. when you want to take that awesome shot, you can always get your awesome lenses which is such a huge segment in DSLR photography. So I would definitely recommend the EOS 450D to anyone starting out with some amateur photography.

I am very disappointed with the quality of outdoor shots. Whether sunny, overcast, or cloudy, all of them seem to be over exposed and cool in tone. I have to manually edit every picture in Photo Shop to adjust the color but because of the overexposure the pictures still seem flat. I have 5 different EF lenses of decent to excellent quality and it does not make a difference which lens I use. Also, auto focus which was once very crisp is now very soft. Quite frankly my, small digital point-and-shoot takes better quality pictures than this digital SLR. Even though I've always had Canon camera's I was seriously considering purchasing a Nikon instead of this camera because I was not happy with my last canon camera (A95). But, after so many years I did not want to judge Canon based on one camera. Well, because my last two Canon purchases were extrmeley disappointing I will not buy another and I now regret not purchasing the Nikon.\n\nJune 6, 2011 - There is another post thinking perhaps the focusing issue is a problem with the user and not with the camera. Sorry, not in this case. I am quite experienced. And again, I need to emphasize, the camera took excellent pictures at first, but the quality has slowly deteriorated over time (I have had the camera for over 2 years). If teh poor picture quality was due to inexperience I would have had the problem right from the beginning.\n\nI will not buy another Canon."},{"reviewerName":"Manuel Forero","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great camera!!!","reviewDate":"January 25, 2010","reviewText":"My sister asked me for a LSR camera, I gift one of this for christmas, since she had, all her friends (photographs and designers) are wondered with this camera.

But my conclusion is that it was not me. It was the camera.\n\nI had such a great experience with the Canon S2IS that I was ready to move up to my first DSLR camera, and what better than the same brand. I enthusiastically ordered the Xsi with the supplied kit lens. I soon realized that no matter which focus setting I used, many pictures, both indoor and outdoor, were slightly out of focus, and slightly underexposed. I took side-by-side pictures together with my S2IS, and was shocked to see that the older, 5 MP camera took pictures much, much better than the Xsi.\n\nI wrote to Canon customer service, and they blamed it on the \"kit\" lens. They suggested I buy a lens with a wider aperture (which was about $1,000, so I thought, \"You're kidding\"). I did not buy the lens, but I did buy an external flash ($350), and the image quality was just the same. I was so disgusted with the situation that I basically stopped using the camera, and continued using the old one instead.\n\nAfter some time, I really gave up on the camera and decided to return it, together with the flash. Fortunately, Amazon has fantastic customer sevice, and everything worked out without a problem.\n\nIn conclusion, my camera definitely had focus problems. These focus problems caused the pictures to be improperly exposed, and the flash strength to be slightly inexact, all contributing to bad image quality. For me, my Xsi's 12 MP sensor and all its other features were worthless if the image quality was lower than that of my 5 MP camera. I am now hesitant to buy another Canon camera, afraid of a repeat of this.\n\nOne star for the camera, and five stars for Amazon's customer service."},{"reviewerName":"Elizabeth King","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Wasted my hard earned dollars","reviewDate":"April 9, 2009","reviewText":"I researched for 6 months before buying this camera and then the upgrade 17-85 IS lens, and thought I had found my perfect camera and lens with live view and all.\nI noticed right out of the box that all my images were soft but I figured it will take time to get it dialed in.

This is it.","reviewDate":"April 24, 2008","reviewText":"i sold my beloved Nikon D70 after four years of use. I still miss it. I purchased a D40, but it never felt right. Picture quality was good, better than the D70, but I had to go through menus to do most everything (changing white balance, ISO, formatting the card, you name it), whereas the D70 had dedicated buttons. That makes all the difference in usability. Besides, the D40 does not even autofocus with my beloved 50mm 1.8 lens. Are you kidding me? I returned the D40 after 3 days of use.\n\nI was lookind at the D80, 40D, the D300, the XTI, and this one. All good cameras (at the end of the day, they all take excellent pictures). it's the usability/sweet price/new features factor that counts. 40D and D300 are expensive for me (not a pro). The XTI is getting old (still good though, and very good price). The D80 is very good, a bigger brother of my beloved d70, but still old: no sensor cleaning, to highlight tone priority, does not ship with a bundled VR lens. You are basically buying a 2006 camera in 2008. I did not like that.\n\nI found this XSI at Circuit City. It felt right in my small hands. It had most of the buttons I need to make changes quickly. I still have to go to a menu to set my custom white balance (the D70 had a button for that). Same thing to format the card (button combination on the D70). Auto ISO is not as smart as Nikon's implementation. Other than that, the camera is excellent. All the other buttons are there. It has an RGB histogram (very important; it lets you see if you are clipping individual colors). Picture quality is great. Very little noise (Canon's CMOS sensor is cleaner than Nikon's CCD on the D80), very pleasing skin tones (I take lots of pictures of my daughter and wife).\n\nIf the D80 had the same 2008 features as this one (highlight tone priority, self-cleaning sensor, bundled VR lens), I would have gotten that one. It's still a great camera. This one is just a 2008 camera with features found in the semi-pro 40D and the pro 1DS.\n\nI'm very happy with it."},{"reviewerName":"michael madison","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Five Stars","reviewDate":"May 26, 2015","reviewText":"Great Camera!"},{"reviewerName":"Ana Paula Borrmann","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"I loved","reviewDate":"February 9, 2010","reviewText":"It was everything that I waited.\nCanon Digital Rebel XSi 12.2 MP Digital SLR Camera with EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS Lens (Black)"},{"reviewerName":"Ray A Saez","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Canon","reviewDate":"December 18, 2012","reviewText":"love it except the Spanish manual.

I read many, many reviews and comparisons and yet did not realize that this camera does not shoot video, while the Nikon D5000 does shoot video and does not cost a lot more money and gets very similar marks on all other aspects. (I found the Nikon d5000 to be less than $100 more than the Canon rebel xsi).\nI also was very disappointed to realize, upon reading the manual, that the \"live view\" is no where near what I was expecting. It is only \"recommended\" for use with a tripod because camera shake will cause the images to be blurred. (that is directly from the manual). Being optimistic, I tried it without a tripod anyway, and it is true; all shots I took while using the \"live view\" are blurry to some degree, even when using the flash. I guess it's true that you have to use the view finder in \"grown up cameras\" (aka: dslr cameras).\nI have owned a Canon Powershot (not dslr, it's a great point and shoot) for a few years and it has video (which is superb even in low light, not dark, but low like indoors in the evening) and it is always a \"live view\", but that's a given because nearly all point and shoot cameras are. my friends who own dslr cameras warned me that when I was ready to move up in the world of cameras, I was going to have to get used to using the view finder instead of the view-screen to set up my shots. Well, I thought I could stay in my comfort zone using the view-screen by buying the Canon rebel xsi because of the \"live view\" feature. I believe now that is it more of a gimmick. But I do realize that this is spoken like a true point and shoot user, not a pro photographer.\nEvery dslr owner I know insists that once you get used to it, using the viewfinder is much better, so I can adjust to using the viewfinder. (even though my baby thinks I've turned into an alien when I put the camera up to my face. so much for making her smile while holding the camera out to the side like I did with my powershot.) however, at this point, it's mostly the ability to shoot video that I am really missing. I feel pretty dumb about not seeing that little fact when researching, but even when I went back today looking at more comparisons, I still don't find many reviews/comparisons that really point out that difference between the nikon d5000 and the canon xsi. The comparisons mainly focus on the image quality. Which, by the way, I am truly thrilled with. The Canon seems to be holding strong on it's reputation of having the best image color and quality in the business. (to my knowledge)\nI just think that for that price range ($550-$650) the fact that one can shoot video and the other can't is a very big difference that new-to-dslr folks should know."},{"reviewerName":"Mark Greiner","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"I really, really want to love this camera","reviewDate":"September 12, 2008","reviewText":"I upgraded to the XSi from the original Canon Digital Rebel (300D). I love everything about the XSi, except for one thing -- it can't take a sharp picture with my Canon 75-300 IS lens. At first I was in denial. Then I spent an afternoon taking pictures with the zoom lens on both the 300D and the XSi. On the 300D, the pictures are as sharp as ever. On the XSi, they are not. It seems to have something to do with the depth of field--the shorter the depth of field (either because of aperture or focal length) the blurrier the picture.\n\nSo I sent it to Canon for repair, along with the 75-300 lens at their suggestion. The XSi was under warranty, so no charge there, but the lens was not, which resulted in a $90 charge.\n\nI just got the camera back; there is no indication as to what they did.

Married with a decent photo program on your computer, it is possible to achieve professional results.\n\nMany reviews say, get this with the stabilization lens.... I wholeheartedly agree... the extra $100 is a bargain price for this lens... It is almost (and I do say almost) like having a tripod.

Lane","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great camera, amazing battery life, now the perfect price!","reviewDate":"April 22, 2008","reviewText":"I have had the XSi for about 3 months now and I am thouroughly impressed with it. This is my first DSLR and I was a little wary about going with a brand-new and untested camera, but I have always like Canon (I used an ELAN II in High School and I bought a SD600 about 2 years ago to take snapshots of my son). Overall, I have not been disappointed with the quality of the photos that the XSi produces. The IS lens works great and I have taken some pretty amazing photos (for me at least). I do have just a couple of issues, both good and bad, that I think those who are looking at buying this may want to know.\n\nBattery life -- Great battery life. I should say, AMAZING battery life. I have taken over 5000 photos and I have only had to charge the battery twice.\n\nLive View -- LiveView is not for beginners. It is not a replacement for your Point-and-Shoot. You can't use it in the AUTO mode (Green Square). This isn't that big of a deal for me, I prefer full manual myself, but the whole point of this feature, I thought, was to make it more user friendly for the Point-and-Shoot photographer. My wife can't use Live View in it's current form (I specifically bought a DSLR with a live view function so she could still use the camera). So, if Live View is a big selling point for you, You may want to look at some others (If it isn't that big of a deal to you, then this is still an amazing camera -- added 4-23-2008). If you do studio work, though, you can hook the camera up to your PC and use it as a remote viewer. But it is not a point-and-shoot camera in Live View. In my earlier review, I said that it would be nice if Canon fixed some of the Live View issues with a firmware update, I was mistaken. Live View is a nice feature once you figure out it is not meant for beginners. Studio and landscape photographers will find Live View a great tool.\n\nImage Quality -- I have had some great success shooting in a studio setting as well as some great outdoor shots. In the studio, I used tungsten \"hot\" lights with the subjuect against a white background. The photos turned out great. Skin tones are perfect and there is very little, if any, chromatic abberation at the edges. It shoots great outdoor shots as well. We just got into beekeeping and I was able to get some AMAZING shots of our bees up-close outdoors. The bees looked dirty and not very interesting from a distance, but the macro photos I got up close are beautiful and full of wonderfully crisp details. The lens is a little short, the image quality you get from it is pretty good considering it only costs $100. I do plan on buying a longer lens in the near future.\n\nOverall, the camera is solid and feels nice in the hand. It isn't too heavy, yet still feels sturdy. If you can afford the higher price, I don't think you will be disappointed. If you can't, the XTi is still a great camera. And if you can afford to wait a few months for the price to drop a little (LIKE IT ALREADY HAS!!) I would. I was able to work a few extra weekends so I could afford to get this, and I can tell you, I don't mind it a bit, because the quality of photos I am getting has been totally worth it.\n\n--- Update ---\nI was incorrect when I said you couldn't use the 9-Point autofocus in Live View. You can use the 9-point autofocus while in Live View, but the mirror flips down and focuses so you can't see what you are trying to focus on until after the camera has actually gone through the autofocus process.\n\n--- Update #2 ---\nI have now had this camera for almost two months and I am happy to report that the more I use it, the more I love it. Once you learn the layout of the camera and you load the MyMenu with the tools you use most often, the camera becomes an absolute delight to use. I have taken over 5000 photos with it so far and now I need an extra hard drive to put them all on.\n\nI was able to rent a Canon EF 24-105 IS L lens and a 580 EX II Speedlite for my sister's wedding. WOW! What great photos. The camera interfaced with the flash flawlessly and I am more convinced than ever that much of the quality of your photos comes from the glass you use and not as much from the camera itself (I think it is about 65% lens to 35% camera body give or take a few points-- I know there will be those who disagree, but that is my take on it, and I am sure if I had a 1Ds MkIII I would think that there wasn't a peice of glass good enough for my camera).\n\nThis is a great beginner dSLR and a great camera all around. I am very happy with my purchase and I have had no regrets whatsoever about spending the $900 to buy such a great tool. Amazon now sells it for $799, you can't go wrong at that price!"},{"reviewerName":"Demon_Mustang","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"WOW. Great camera for serious beginners or back up camera for pros","reviewDate":"December 26, 2008","reviewText":"I am new to SLR photography and I recognize that this is not considered a true \"professional\" dSLR but I don't think you can get much closer to one for under $1000.\n\nWhy isn't this considered a true professional dSLR? Well one big reason is the sensor size. It has what is called a APS-C sized sensor, while the professional ones have a full frame sensor like the 5D (check out the 5D Mark II, I've read great things about it). Another I think is the buffer size in the camera might not be as large so it won't take as many shots in burst mode before needing to stop to save as the professional ones. But other than that, you will basically get all of the important functions that make dSLR cameras so great.\n\nFirst of all, don't get sucked into the megapixel wars. There are several point-and-shoot digital cameras that advertise higher megapixels than 12.2 that might cost less. What people often don't realize is that picture quality has little to do with the megapixels and more to do with the sensor and image processor. The megapixel number is simply the resolution of the image. A crappy image recorded in a very high resolution is just as crappy. Point and shoot cameras have smaller sensor sizes than dSLR cameras. Especially the compact cameras, that's why even when I was using P&S cameras I never bought a compact camera. They are more popular simply because they \"look\" sleeker and more stylish. The picture quality is obviously lower than that of a regular non-compact P&S camera AND they cost more, so there's really no real reason to buy them other than for the looks and the convenience. Although I've been able to carry my Canon Powershot A580 in my pocket without a problem...\n\nThis camera takes amazing photos, even with the kit lens, which I highly recommend if you're on a budget BTW. My mother has a friend that is the wife of a pro-photographer. So when I was in the market for a dSLR, my mother referred me to talk with her. Her first suggestion is to not get the kit lens but instead spend more for the 17-85mm ef-s lens. Well, I'm glad I didn't take her advice and went with the kit lens because I just read a review of the lens where the pro-photographer writing the review specifically compared it to that very lens and have said that the cheap kit lens is actually a bit better than the more expensive 17-85mm lens in terms of chromatic aberration problems which is where high contrast areas show a weird color outline due to the lens not focusing all the color wavelengths correctly. Although my main reason for going with the kit lens was financial, and was because of all of the positive reviews I've read about it. But it still turned out very well.\n\nSo don't let some pro's or semi-pro's discourage you from getting the kit. They're not wrong though, the kit lenses that came with Canon dSLR's in the past have been pretty bad, it's this specific kit lens that is the exception so be confident in buying it. You can always keep using this while you save up your money for better lenses later. A good addition to it would be the 55-250mm ef-s lens. I recommend that over the 75-300mm lens for several reasons. I've read worse reviews for the 75-300mm lens in terms of image quality, and because with the 55-250mm, you don't have a gap in focal lengths. Along with the 18-55mm kit lens, you basically have an uninterrupted range of 18-250mm.\n\nOne area where the quality of the sensor really shows is in low light shots with high ISO speeds. I haven't had the need to use any high ISO numbers yet, so I can't say personally, but from what I've read from many professionals who have reviews this camera, that even at the highest ISO setting of 1600, there isn't too much noise. Which is a very good thing.\n\nOne complaint I've read a lot about the previous compact dSLR's such as the XTi is the size and shape of the grip not being comfortable. Some say the grip on the right side was too close to the lens and caused their fingers to feel cramped against the lens. Well, let me tell you that isn't a problem with the XSi. I know they redesigned it for this very reason, and from my experience, it doesn't feel very cramped at all. The camera is indeed very light weight and compact compared to the more professional dSLR's so it's a great camera to bring with you on vacations or long hikes or whatever. I find all of the controls to be easy to reach and the settings are real easy to change on the fly.\n\nThe menu system is great too, it comes with a very useful feature called \"My Menu\" where you can actually pick any 6 functions you feel you will use the most and put them into this one menu and you can arrange it any way you want. Then you can make it the default menu so instead of it going to the last menu you were looking at when you hit the menu button, it goes straight to this customized menu of yours. It's a great feature and makes accessing special functions like mirror lock up, AEB, flash exposure compensation, etc. etc. very fast and easy.\n\nI would highly recommend anyone looking to buy a sub $1000 dSLR camera to buy this camera with the kit lens. So far the only thing I found that I think needs to be added is interchangeable focus screens. I would have liked to have grid lines in my view finder to make composition faster and less of a guessing game when trying to apply little rules like the rule of thirds or keeping the horizon line straight.\n\nI highly recommend reading Ben Long's The Canon EOS Digital Rebel XSi/450D Companion if you buy this camera. It will \"show you the ropes\" so you can use this camera to its maximum potential. Bryan Peterson's Understanding Exposure is a very good book to understand the proper use of shutter speed, ISO, and aperture. And when you open the package, within the manual and other cards and what-not, there is a blank white card. Don't discard this, keep it in your camera case, it's a simple tool to use for custom white balance. Read about it in the manual or book if you don't know what that is. It's an essential tool if you plan on taking any photos indoors without a flash.\n\nNow stop reading these reviews and buy one of these cameras already, you won't be disappointed."},{"reviewerName":"Bubba","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Auto focus points could be better.","reviewDate":"November 14, 2010","reviewText":"This review is for the newcomer to DSLR's and not the advanced user. So we don't need to hear the experts bashing on how someone doesn't know what they are doing and shoudn't get a camera like this. I am speaking for the person who needs a camera to capture their kids in the school play, soccer game etc. and can't capture the moment with a point and shoot. You can't expect awesome pictures if you do not learn how to use all the settings, features, and purpose of an SLR camera. You might even get worse pictures than your point and shoot. Sure an SLR has an auto feature where it will figure what is the best settings to use for a basic picture, but you also end up with a basic picture.\n\nBut even all said I would still recommend an SLR and a good zoom lens that you can afford. It is worth spending the money because you can never recapture that moment of your child or whatever your trying to capture. How many pictures have you taken with a point and shoot that were horrible because they were too dark or blurry? Sure they are fine if the lighting is good and you are within 10 feet or so away. Any further than that well, why bother. The larger zoom type cameras are better but are still limited when lighting is an issue. The pocket type point and shoots usually have a lag time between shots or flash charging up again. So forget about getting off several shots in succesion. Hard to capture a picture if the object is in motion also. The larger zoom types have mimimal lag time and some can even fire off bursts of 3 to 5 in a second with one push of the button and better at capturing something in motion. But they still can't beat an DSLR. I have gotten shots of my children with an DSLR with low lighting and no flash from many rows of seats away and they were great. The image quality was even good enough where I can crop it and still look good. People using their camera phones crack me up, but that's another story.\n\nI am not going to get into all the technicalities of this camera. You can read the other reviews for that. I just want to mention that if you are one of those people who need to step up to an SLR because the point and shoot couldn't do the job but don't want to become the serious photographer then this inforomation might be what you are looking for.\n\nI find the XSI pictures are soft and not crisp. Some photographers prefer this. The new Nikon DSLR's take crisper pictures, and they are less expensive.\n\nThe main con of the XSI is the focusing points. If you use the camera in auto mode then it will focus on the nearest or most identifiable focus points it can focus on. So it might focus on an object in front of the actual thing your trying to capture that is behind it, or on a purse or print on a shirt for example instead of the persons face or what not. If your trying to get a group picture with the guest of honor in the middle of it, you might not have that person in full focus but instead the preople around because the cameras focus is focusing on the most vivid or closest points. You can set the camera in one of the manual settings and pick one focus point of your choice, like center, top, left, right etc. but you can't pick all on. In auto it will focus on more than one but like I mentioned before, not excactly on what you want. you can press the shutter button half way and it will try and refocus on different points or you can get closer to your subject and press the shutter button half way and hold it so it keeps that focus point and then you step back and snap the picture. Well you don't have the luxury of time on your hands for those kid or spontaneous shots.\n\nSo this is where I recommend the newer Nikon DSLR's. Their focus points I find tend to focus on more points and usually on the center also where my subject tends to be. The XSI was here and there. If the area your focusing on is busy, the XSI will pick a few focus points here and there were it thinks are the best. But with the Nikon, I found it to focus on more points which is nice because the whole image will be more sharper instead of certain areas of it when cropping or zooming the image on a computer. Unless you are going for the \"bokeh\" effect in which the subject is in focus and the area around it is blurred.\n\nA camera of this size isn't always convienient to carry around to all occasions because of it's size, accessories, worries, or whatever the reason. If you already have a pocket point and shoot or zoom camera, don't get rid of them. I keep them for when I go on vacation because I don't want to carry a big DSLR around on vacation. I use the pocket one for when we go out and I don't want to carry anything bulky and for those you never know shots. I use the zoom one for the amusement parks. It's small enough where it is still manageable where I can toss in my backpack. I use that one for the amusement parks because I can get pictures of the kids on rides. The zoom and speed is adequate enough where I can get pictures of the kids in the distance or when their zooming down the roller coaster. One day I might get rid of my pocket one and get a waterproof one, that way I have all my bases covered. Ha ha.\n\nBut when you learn how to use a DSLR's features coupled with a decent lens, man the pictures are like night and day.\n\nIf you still find that a DSLR is just too much over kill for you then you might want to check out the Nikon S8100. It is a little higher end point and shoot that is a little larger than your average point and shoot but it takes amazing pictures at a distance and in low lighting and has HD video capture with stereo. My nephew has the older S8000 model of this and I was blown away at the pictures and videos he took at my childs play. And we were sitting way back. They made improvements on the S8100 where it counted so I can't imganine how good it would be now, wow.\n\nI would recommend you try out different cameras and brands in the store and decide which one suits you. Look for optical zoom, optical image stabilization, and good low light capability."},{"reviewerName":"mrooobaa","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Fantastic Entry Level SLR","reviewDate":"June 23, 2010","reviewText":"For the longest time, I have never had a real digital camera (for pictures, I would always use the camera on my enV Touch). I never wanted to get a small point and shoot camera because I've never been happy with the image quality. One day, my grandpa gave me a Sigma EF lens, and since I had the lens, I decided to go ahead and take the plunge into the DSLR world. The lens pretty much decided that I was going to get a Canon EOS DSLR, so I just had to choose the right one. I wanted to get the most for my money, so I decided to go get a used camera. I saw that my options were the XSi, XTi, an older 30D, and the first generation 1D. After doing a ton of research, I decided that the XSi was the best thing to get, as it had live view and a self cleaning CMOS sensor. I've had this camera for about a month, and overall I am very pleased with it:\n\nPros:\n-Excellent image quality. Unless you're taking images with a really bad lens or a damaged lens, if taken properly, the photos will look great. The colors look fantastic, and the detail is astounding.\n-Easy to use. Shooting in automatic pretty much makes it act as a point and shoot camera, but once you learn how to shoot in manual, you won't regret it. Adjusting the ISO, shutter speed and f-prime are really easy and quick to do, so if you need to get a shot of something very quickly, it is very possible.\n-Well built. The body is plastic, but it is well constructed. I wouldn't drop it on any hard surface, but the camera could take a decent beating.\n-Good built in flash. It's nowhere near a professional flash, but it's bright enough so that you can take pictures in just about any dark area. It will destroy the flash on ANY point and shoot camera. You can't adjust it to use it for modified lighting.\n-Light. Mostly due to the fact that the body isn't made of metal, but it helps if you have it around your neck all day.\n-Lens compatibility. Like all other Canon DSLR's, it takes EF lenses, so thankfully finding a compatible lens is very easy to do.\n-Live view. I definitely prefer the viewfinder (it seems like it's easier to steady the camera when it's closer to your face), but if I need someone to take a picture for me, I like the fact that I can set it to automatic, turn on live view and be confident that someone who isn't familiar with camera equipment could still take a good picture.\n-The LCD screen is INCREDIBLE. I know it seems childish to type a word in all caps, but this LCD screen deserves it. A full sized monitor is still better for viewing the pictures, but Canon is not lying about the ridiculous viewing angle. The colors and sharpness really pop out!\n\nCons:\n-When I got it out of the box, it had some auto-focus issues (similar to the ones discussed in other reviews here). However, I updated the firmware (search \"canon eos xsi firmware\" on Google to find it) and it seems to be doing much better (I went from 1.0.4 to 1.1.0). It was a pain that I had to update the firmware, but things like that happen. I feel like it did resolve the issue though.\n-ISO only goes up to 1600. While going up any higher usually isn't a good idea, sometimes it's necessary for places that don't have good lighting. Getting a lens with a low f-prime will help (anywhere between 1.2-1.8 will work), but it would've been nice to have it go up to at least 3200.\n\nOverall:\nFantastic camera. I bought this from a friend with a battery, charger, case and a couple of other goodies for a good price, and I don't regret it. It has its minor issues, but once you get used to the camera, you will easily overlook them. This performs about equivalent to a Nikon D60.\n\nHowever, if you want the most bang for your buck, you are best off buying the camera body without the kit lens, and then buying a 50mm lens and a telephoto lens.\n\nEdit 12/22/2011: Still loving the camera. Everything seems to work well, except for on/off switch gets a little sticky, and will sometimes move the mode wheel, and vice versa. Also, I'm realizing that the ISO range is rather limited. 400 is pretty good, but 800 and 1600 look too grainy. Nonetheless, the camera still serves me well."},{"reviewerName":"Capt Chris","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Xsi good camera good price","reviewDate":"December 30, 2009","reviewText":"I am a pro shooter who got this camera to use for fun and trips were i would be mad if i damaged my high end $$$ body.(like skiing) Any way i love the camera so far.

You however can not take this camera out of the box and get the best pictures it can take. they will be ok but you need to take the time and set up your camera. READ the book if you dont know what your doing. I got the kit camera with the 18-55 IS lens and it is ok. The camera takes much better pictures with my 35-350 72mm L lens on it, as will any camera, spend your money on the glass not the body.\n\nIf you want a good camera for the price this is the one for you. If you have older EOS cameras your old lenses will work with the new camera. I also use my 430EZ flash that is from my A2 EOS film camera, it is way over powering in the auto mode (as it is not a E-TTL flash only a TTL) but it works if you manual set it, for inside i use 1/16 or 1/32 (up to 10-15 feet works great) out side i set it to full power and i can light up a subject 100 feet away! (it is great for that)\n\nIf you have used a EOS before this works about the same. even from my old film EOS to this one, the basic-mid advance functions are the same.\n\nBEWARE were you but from online. do not buy from a company who dose not have a good reviews (reviews not rating, and read the bad ones too).

First I thought about the Canon SX200, switched to the Nikon P80, but then realized that I truly wanted to upgrade and become the best amateur photographer I could be!!!\n\nI purchased this camera out of a local electronics department in April--surprisingly on sale cheaper than Amazon!!! I knew before purchasing that the zoom on the kit lens wouldn't be enough for me, so I had the Sigma 18-200mm f/3.5-6.3 DC AF OS (Optical Stabilizer) Zoom Lens for Canon Digital SLR Cameras on it's way to me from eBay and also the Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 II Camera Lens that everyone touts on the digital photo forums. I sold the kit lens to offset the costs. Rule #1 to upgrading to SLRs: Once you learn the excellence of SLRs, be ready to spend, spend, spend!\n\nThe Canon XSi helps me on my journey big time. Upon purchasing this camera, I had no idea what f-stop meant, why exposure was so important and what the heck was bokeh and DoF. While pondering what in the world I had gotten myself into, I went out and started snapping away. This camera, while intimidating at first easily let me transition from the Auto quickness of P&S into careful planning with Digital SLRs.\n\nNew to SLRs, I had to learn that \"live view\" was something that I as a P&S consumer had gotten used to, not something that truly belonged on a camera. I had no problem whatsoever transitioning to looking in the peephole. Taking pictures gets addicting with this camera. It has an easy-to-understand manual, and tons of digital photo forums/reviews to get one into the groove of using this camera. I mentioned earlier that I tossed the kit lens, but that doesn't mean it's a bad lens. I've seen photos of the kit lens, and I've seen photos of L lens. Depending on the photographer, they are excellent photos!\n\nI first started taking photos on the \"P\" mode, not really understanding what it stood for, but just knowing that I could use that mode w/o enabling the flash (more of the flash later). The \"TV\" and \"A\" modes are also good to use, but for me it's mainly P or Manual.\n\nI've attempted to use live view a couple of times, but for me it just gets in the way of trying to take a good photo. I'd rather take a few test shots and then tweak the settings.\n\nOne thing I've learned on photography is that the actual camera is only a tiny percentage of taking a good picture. Depending on who you ask, it can vary from 1% to 10%. For me, it's about 20% because of my amateur skills. The rest of a good picture depends on the lens used and most importantly, the actual picture taker! That said, potential new Canon XSi (D-SLR) users, please do not purchase this camera thinking you'll become a pro overnight. If you take the time to understand the elements of basic photography (exposure, depth, etc.), then you will most likely be fine with whatever you're using now. If you want to boost your skills and know for a fact that you are limited with P&S, then you are ready to upgrade and the XSi is a likely candidate.\n\nA note on equipment. Before you go spending countless dollars on lenses and equipment, figure out what you are going to be using your camera for and what the majority of your photo subjects are. Do your research on the forums and all the reviews and then make your decisions. If you take tons of photos of your babes and are frustrated with the blurriness of low light or washing them out with the built in a flash, then a faster lens is for you along with an external flash.\n\nThe built-in flash is not great. I plan on adding a tripod and the Canon Speedlite 430EX II Flash for Canon Digital SLR Cameras to my setup. Most of my pics are taken during the day or where plenty of light is because of that very reason. Also, because of the lack of a good flash, the few night shots I do take come out extremely grainy because I have to increase the iso way high. Cool for some photos, but not for every single night shot.\n\nI can go on about this camera, but my star rating says it all. I don't plan on upgrading until they come out with another SLR comparable to the Canon 40D that uses SD cards (my memory of choice), so it may be a while. Until then, the XSi will be my new photo road dog. That along with my two lenses, makes this camera the ultimate in beginner SLR photography.\n\nSome other good equipment to add to your camera bag (if you're a true beginner):\n\nA good intro or how-to digital photo book like Scott Kelby's Digital Photography Boxed Set, Volumes 1 and 2 (Includes The Digital Photography Book Volume 1 and The Digital Photography Book Volume 2) (Careful of the \"humor\" in this one. The author doesn't get it that it isn't really funny.)\n\nAdobe Photoshop Elements 6 (Mac)\n\nFor photo management:\nApple Aperture 2.1.1 (Mac)\nAdobe Photoshop Lightroom 2 (PC)\n\nSandisk 8GB EXTREME III SDHC SD Card Class 6 (SDSDX3-8192, Plastic Case) I currently use the 4GB and can get 850 odd photos on the highest resolution in JPEG and about 300 photos shooting RAW+JPEG.\n\nA good tripod.\nA good photo bag. Right now I use a certain bag if I'm at work and just an old purse if I'm out and I want to be stylish. I do not prefer camera bags that look like camera bags."},{"reviewerName":"N.D.S.","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Best camera value for under $1500 new.","reviewDate":"March 2, 2010","reviewText":"There really isn't a better deal out there under $1500, or at least under $1,000... under the canon/nikon lineup. After 7 months of use, I can say that this is one amazing camera. It has many of the functions that you get with the 50D. Unless you care about HD video or care about being able to do some major cropping to your photos, your best best for the $ is the XSi.\n\nOne thing to take note is that the noise levels are amazing. One step down from this camera and you get way too much noise. The 50D has very comparable noise levels. I shoot in a club at iso 1600, exposures without flash run into 1/2 second... noise reduced, they are still excellent quality.. even at 1:1 crops.\n\nAlso a note on buttons: If you care about using your camera quickly and usefully (unlike a point and shoot) DON'T buy any lower than this! Any step down is missing the shortcut hardware buttons. Why buy an slr, only to change settings in menus?? Sure it is still missing a few buttons, but you can set your own custom menu to help negate that drawback.\n\nMetering is decent, you need to make sure to point at a more neutral object to get a good reading. With using the in-camera spot metering on a lastolite ezybalance gray card to get an exposure reading (then switching the camera from Aperture Priority, to Manual and inputing those settings read), the exposure is quite good.\n\nNo IR assist lamp, so you will have to use an external flash with flash firing turned off (assuming you don't want to use flash) to use its IR assist lamp to focus in the dark. The feature to turn flash firing off, while using the focus assist lamp, is missing on a lot of cameras - so watch out if this is something you are interested in.\n\nQuality is great, noise levels are great, auto focus is pretty good, metering is ok, LCD is amazing (!), no IR assist lamp =(\n\nWell I'd recommend you stop reading user reviews and go read some professional reviews from somewhere like dpreview, the-digital-picture, and steve's digicams.

It is not babied at all, more like handled rough. This thing is tough. I got it when they first came out, March 2008, and it has gone everywhere I've gone since then. Still works great, despite a few dents and dings.\n\nI use a number of lenses with it, and get great image quality.\n\nBy now maybe it's getting a little long in the tooth in some respects. I'm not sure I see much advantage in more pixels on this size sensor, so the 15 or 18 mP now available doesn't sway me much. But I am limited by the iso range. I hesitate to go above 400 iso with this body. At 800 iso images are usable, but if you do much cropping or sharpening you will very quickly find the noise in the image. I am not experienced enough to apply noise reduction well. Newer models have higher iso ranges, and I assume that they will do a better job at 800 and 1600 iso. For most folk most of the time I doubt it's an issue, but sometimes you could use that extra iso. I also think manufacturers may be getting more dynamic range from their sensors now, but have not seen any quantitative proof of that. Otherwise I think this body is quite comparable to any more recent model. I actually prefer it to my wife's 50D most of the time.\n\nI shoot all RAW. Originally I had never done that and found it intimidating. I initially set the camera to RAW + JPEG. It was too slow that way. I soon discovered that I could do a much better job with the RAWs using the supplied software than Canon could making a jpeg. Within a week jpeg was gone. If you are going to a dSLR, I suggest you use RAW. If you want to invest in some software, RAW will pay off even more. By now, even PhotoShop Elements handles RAW and provides a fairly powerful, if stodgy, editing experience. Presently I am using Lightroom or CS5, but those will be priced beyond most folk in the market for this camera. Still, if I were to do it over today, I'd save the money on the body (ie get an XSi vs a more modern body) and keep it for the software, accessories, or lenses. I truly feel you'll get more bang for your buck with that approach.\n\nAll-in-all, I think this model still holds it's own and now presents a great bargain in the market. I've done prints up to 20 x 30\" off this camera with fantastic results.\n\nI use 5 ea 8 gB SDHC storage cards with this camera. Shooting raw I get about 460 images on a card, so I can go two-three weeks with this setup. Today I would purchase fewer, but larger SDHC cards. Speed Class 6 is noticeably faster. Suggest you stick to that specification. A RAW file is roughly 15 mb. If you have never dealt with a dSLR before, or this size file, be aware that they eat up hard disk space on your pc pretty fast. Also transfer time can be appreciable, depending on your pc, etc. It takes me about 10-12 minutes to download an 8 gB card. I use portable hard drives kept in the safe for storage.\n\nBattery life is just simply amazing. I carry an extra battery, and I lent it to a friend once. Really, even in heavy shooting, w/o flash, you can certainly do 1500 images on a charge. Do get an extra battery (aftermarket is cheap and works great), because a battery can always fail, but if you charge yours every few days of use, you should never run low.\n\nEnjoy your shooting!"},{"reviewerName":"Rob","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"My first SLR & loving it !","reviewDate":"October 23, 2009","reviewText":"This is my first DSLR camera so I give you a review from a newbies, first-hands on point of view. So far I have not used many of the features other than auto program but let me tell you I am getting some NICE shots and so far I am pleasantly pleased. I researched this camera for a while and it was a toss up from this or the T1i. The latter having HD video and about 3 more megapixels in resolution. Well I didn't choose the T1I because I really don't need video capabilities on my camera, that's what camcorders are for. Also, should the video feature go bad, so could the camera itself ( remember DVD/VHS combos? ). Having said that here's my opinion so far.\nThe quality of pics with the kit lens is amazing. Im getting some pics that make point and shoot look like cell phone pics. The feel, look and construction of the camera is good and the ones who feel otherwise are spoiled by their $5000 cameras. For the money you cannot go wrong, this baby will not dissapoint. However the kit lens was not enough for me and my intended purpose ( landscape, wildlife photography for which I got a Canon EFS 55-250mm with IS ) Not to say it is bad, it is perfect for every day use. I will still use it for family, indoor shots as the 55-250 is a bit too zoomie for indoor use. I recommend the Canon gadget bag for your XSI as it compliments each other well. I will not get too technical with this review, as I know poeple read these in order to make a purchasing decision.\nBottom line, if you never owned a DSLR camera this is the one to get. Simple to use, good build and looks and excellent performance. Fast shutter speed and come on it's a Canon, you can't go wrong with it. Don't be fooled by others that say Canon lenses are plasticky and have plastic mounts, that's all a bunch of hogwash. They are plastic but still have a sturdy build feel to it and besides it is a sensitive electronic equipment. Not designed to be banged around and if you do bang your camera then maybe photography is not for you."},{"reviewerName":"Ivan's girl","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"I love it!","reviewDate":"January 18, 2012","reviewText":"I bought the rebel xsi used and I'm really enjoying using it. I've taken thousands of pictures and learn with each one. I usually have it set to full manual and on RAW + JPEG. There is so much to learn using a dslr about how to achieve the results you want. I suggest keeping the manual handy until you get all the functions down though. I love that after I take a picture I can hit play and then zoom in on my picture on the back lcd, it helps to see if my focus was any good and has saved me from lots of blurry pictures. The camera is just the right weight, feels comfortable and I'm pretty satisfied with where the controls are.\n\nI favor using a viewfinder, so I can't comment on the Live View mode. The xsi viewfinder has a diopter that adjusts the sight if you wear glasses. I tried using this at first, but it was a pain to take off my glasses to shoot and then put them back on to check out the pictures. I bought an eyepiece for the camera (check out my reviews) and have been quite pleased with it so now I can shoot with my glasses on. If you use the viewfinder you will soon figure out that what you get is a little bit more than what you see; but once you know that, it isn't too much of an issue.\n\nI also suggest getting the 18-55mm IS lens with this camera. It is a wonderful, low-end lens. Just remember that if you are using a tripod to turn off the Image Stabilizer otherwise your pictures might not be so crisp. I have taken some of my best pictures with this lens.\n\nI did have one issue with the flash not popping up.... but that was fixed by putting a small folded paper in the flash hinge area (i haven't had any problems since I did that.....about 3000 pictures ago).\n\nSo if you want a inexpensive fun dslr, the rebel xsi if for you. If you want to be able to shoot video as well than get the more expensive Rebel T series, but for now I am enjoying the xsi."},{"reviewerName":"ChristineMM","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"My First DSLR - Happy with It for 2.5 Years So Far","reviewDate":"April 21, 2011","reviewText":"After abandoning my film SLR in the early 1990s for the ease of a point and shoot, and later, digital point and shoot cameras I bought this camera as my first DSLR exactly 2.5 years ago. I wanted more control over the focus and was frustrated with the auto focus of my point and shoot not focusing on what I wanted it to, especially for macro nature photography. I wanted more control with taking photos in existing light. For candids I wanted a fast shutter with a fast flash recovery so I could have photos of my kids blowing out the birthday candles instead of only shots after the fact due to long recharge times.\n\nA professional photographer friend looked over my xSi and was surprised at the number of features it has. It surpassed his two year old DSLR which cost a lot more at the time. He said the camera is really loaded and is set to do many things automatically that used to require intentional decision making and manual setting by the photographer. His point was that many users will probably not fully explore their camera's capabilities and also that Canon has taken some of the thinking process out of the equation, which amazed him. I will confess I have not yet learned all of the camera's functions as I've been teaching myself slowly using books.\n\nIf you are intimidated to buy your first DSLR just know you can use it on the automatic function and slowly learn other modes as you desire. As a new challenge comes up I go teach myself about that topic then experiment with the new-to-me function.\n\nThe camera body is lightweight. I carry it in my pocketbook with the 18.5 - 55mm image stabilizng lens that came with it.\n\nThe battery lasts a long time, sometimes a month. Flash use saps the battery. I bought two extra inexpensive generic batteries and keep them charged and with me, especially useful when we're on vacation and I really don't want to run out of batteries. The batteries recharge within just a couple of hours with the Canon battery charger.\n\nI'm thrilled with this camera. I get many compliments on my photographs. I also entered two photos in an art show and actually sold one, so that is saying something.\n\nI'm enjoying the process of seeing the world though a photographer's eye. Being always at the ready with my camera with me at all times has allowed me to take thousands of photos over these two-plus years."},{"reviewerName":"Robert Stone","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"A Great DSLR Going Strong After 2 Years","reviewDate":"February 21, 2010","reviewText":"I bought this when it first came out in 2008 prior to a trip to Disney. It replaced an original Digital Rebel (6.3 MP) which was also a great camera (which I passed down ?up to my Dad). Getting this camera has taken my photography to a whole new level - it is a great camera. It is easy to use and takes sharp pictures. The user interface is well done and will be second nature to anyone with experience with a Canon (even point and shoots). The easiest thing to do is to use it in \"full auto\" mode for a while but don't get complacent and keep it there for the life of the camera - try turning that dial and repeating shots so you can learn all that this wonderful unit is capable of. At the price point this is really too good to pass up.\n\nIf you are considering this camera vs. the point and shoot variety, I have found the main two advantages of DSLR to be the lack of delay in shutter release and of course the clarity of the pictures with the larger lenses. The first issue is often of paramount importance in taking pictures of kids and pets - they never stay still for long! With regards to picture quality, it is interesting that manufacturers \"push\" the megapixels so much on the point and shoots. PLEASE don't make the mistake of thinking that 12 MP on a point and shoot will come anywhere near the pictures from this camera (provided a good lens is attached). There really is no comparison. I have several point and shoot cameras (which I have also reviewed) and though they trump the DSLR for portability (or ability to immerse in water for the D10) there is no comparison for picture quality.\n\nI have recently upgraded lenses with the addition of two \"L\" lenses (which work great with the XSI) and may upgrade to the new Rebel T2i in the future for both improved sensitivity (ISO 6400 on that camera, 1600 max on this one) and the ability to record HD video, which this camera does not have. That said, this camera has served me very well and will continue to do so. As another reviewer pointed out, the battery life on this one is terrific - I bought a second battery but have only rarely used it (though I rotate them, of course).\n\nIn summary, this is a terrific camera which I would highly recommend to anyone considering \"making the jump\" to DSLR."},{"reviewerName":"Kimo","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"I LOVE this camera!","reviewDate":"July 11, 2009","reviewText":"I bought this camera just before the Canon T1i arrived. At first, I was tempted to wait for the T1i. However, after a less than pleasant experience with the 14.7MP digic 4 in the G10, I decided to go with the smaller megapixel Digic 3. Plus, after trying the camera out a bit before buying, it just felt right. The first thing I'll say is to get some good glass. The bundled lens, although adequate for everyday family shots and casual shooting, just don't compare with Canon's higher lenses. I purchased a 50MM 1.8 and this lens blows away the kit lens. Best of all, it's cheap, under a hundred bucks. I'm now working on saving the necessary $1,500 to get the 2.8 zoom I drool over. Yes, that lens costs more than twice what I paid for the camera, but if you're not going to get good glass, you might as well stick to the point and shoot models because you'll get the same results. Okay, lenses out of the way, the camera itself is awesome. Auto-focus performance is good, the camera is lightning fast in burst mode with a good card (I use the Sandisk Extreme III), the menu system is logically arranged and easy to access, and the camera handles like a dream. The body, although not as rugged as some would like, gives the camera a nice light weight, making it easy to lug around all day. The flash is about as good as can be expected for a pop-up built in unit, but it does provide adequate lighting for most situations. RAW mode works good with Photoshop and Canon also bundles pretty decent software for processing and adjusting RAW photos as well as organizing and comparing shots (now if they could only get their act together with their camcorder software bundles). The image stabilization works well without introducing any artifacts or softening the photos in a negative way. One of the major complaints with this camera from a lot of users is front focus issues. Although I have experienced some blurry shots, I can definitely attribute these to user error and a little over reliance on the auto-focus on my behalf. If I take my time and make sure my focus markers are on the right point, I get consistently sharp photos. All in all, I think this is a very good camera for the money. Although the T1i has a few more features, I just can't justify paying nearly $150 bucks more for them. I mean, I've been using SLR and P&S cameras with viewfinders for most of my life. Things like \"Live View\" don't phase me and I can certainly live without it. Now, if you're a P&S user making the leap to DSLR, then maybe live view is an important feature. It's just not something I (nor many others) need. I'd rather invest that money in better lenses. Plus, as I said, I'm not sold on the Digic 4 processor yet. Maybe it was just the G10, but besides with my own eyes, I've seen other grumblings online about the Digic 4. Newer doesn't always necessarily mean better. If you're looking for a great value and can live without the coolness factor of having the absolute latest model available, this DSLR is a great buy."},{"reviewerName":"J Y","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great Camera For The Beginning Photographer","reviewDate":"February 11, 2009","reviewText":"I'm a photo enthusiast who's been using the Canon XSi for six months now and here are my impressions.\n\nWeight/Handling: First off, the camera is really light. If anyone tells you that this camera is heavy, then they probably never held a full-frame professional DSLR. The light weight makes it a joy to carry around when traveling. However, serious/pro photographers might feel that the small weight and size lend to an unprofessional feel. Also, this is a minor point, but the shutter makes a high pitched noise as opposed to more professional cameras that have a low, unobtrusive noise. This camera doesn't have too many buttons, as opposed to Nikon cameras. Rather, many of the more specialized functions have to be accessed through menus. Some people will find this very annoying. I personally don't mind. In addition, if you have big hands, you will have a hard maintaining a comfortable grip on the camera because the grip is rather small. If this is the case, consider purchasing the optional battery grip.\n\nImage Quality: At low ISO settings, the image quality is very good and I actually performed a professional portrait shoot using this camera. The 12 megapixels are enough to get good 8x12inch prints, and in really ideal situations with a good lens, proper lighting, exposure, etc, you might be able to squeeze out 12x18inch prints. At ISO 800 and above, noise does become perceptible and if you use heavy amounts of sharpening, images will appear quite nasty. However, if you stay away from over-sharpening at high ISO's, a small amount of software noise reduction should take care of most problems. Thus, this camera is not very good in situations with low light AND moving subjects, such as parties. For this reason, I am considering upgrading to the 5D for better noise handling. And remember, image quality has more to do with a good lens than it has to do with with a camera's megapixel number.\n\nKit Lens: The kit lens is enough to handle basic photographic needs. My personal copy of the lens is very sharp in the center but you might not be so lucky. The focus ring is REALLY TINY and so if you're a manual focus type of person, you'll want to find a new lens very quickly. Also, if you want to take pictures of your kids playing sports or indoor pictures with lots of moving people, consider getting a faster lens. For sports, I recommend the 55-250 IS, 70-300IS, or if you can afford it, the 70-200 2.8L. For indoor/low-light photography, consider augmenting your kit with a prime lens such as the 50mm 1.8, 50mm 1.4, or if you know about the benefits of the L series of Canon lens, I probably don't need to refer you to any more lenses.\n\nOther Issues: The on-camera flash is almost completely useless for taking pictures of people in dim lighting. Why? Because Canon's engineers somehow decided that they should have the flash fire 5-10 quick bursts to assist the camera's various sensors. Trust me, your subjects will not appreciate your flash firing off like a machine gun in front of their face. I highly recommend an external flash like the 420ex or 430ex if you're getting this camera to solve that problem. Nikon users will not have to deal with the problem.\n\nOverall Impressions: If you're just getting into the world of DSLRs or you're a photo enthusiast strapped for cash (like me), the XSi is a great choice to start out on and with skilled use, its hardware is capable of achieving very good results. Also, by choosing Canon, you have access to the largest selection of lenses. I've taken some great pictures with this camera and I plan to keep it around. However, you might also want to evaluate the Canon 40D and the Nikon D90."},{"reviewerName":"Harry W","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Excellent Entry level DSLR - Superb image quality","reviewDate":"March 4, 2010","reviewText":"I bought the Rebel Xsi after I was extremely disappointed by the indoor image quality from my Nikon D60 with f>8.0. Where Nikon D60 failed miserably, the Rebel Xsi has been superb. I routinely take indoor group photographs with it with f8 or f11 at iso 400 (flash on) and they come out excellent!!! They are very sharp and have very good details, I don't even need to up the iso. I would have to give 5 starts to the sensor in this thing, it is just amazing!!!\n\nThe best camera's are the ones which shine in low light (indoor) and the rebel xsi's sensor gives it the ability to outperform anything else in this price range...\n\nThe other gr8 thing about the Xsi is that for another 90$ I was able to buy a gr8 portrait lens, the 50mm f1.8 prime lens. That thing is so fast that I do not need flash at all for taking potrait images of my kids. I love that lens!!!!\ning.\nOverall I am very happy with this camera. The only annoying this it has is the flash strobe based AF assist vs Nikon's AF assist lamp. The flash based AF assist gives the subject's the wrong impression about when the picture is taken and is very annoying. Thankfully I have enough light in my house (where I take most of my indoor shots) that the flash AF assist is needed only about 10% of the time. I wanted to buy a speedlite to solve this issue + give me bounce flash etc., but the opteka speedlite turned out to be a waste of money (1 star) and the canon one (430 exII) is too much $$$ for me.\n\nSo for now I am just happy with the regular flash.... It gives good exposure most of the time (For potraits I focus on the faces and for groups pics I focus on darker clothes to get good exposure with the built in flash).\n\nAlso I only using center focus point 90% of the time as it is the fastest and most accurate.\n\nAgain overall the camera is 5 star."},{"reviewerName":"John Reynolds","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"An excellent upgrade to a great camera","reviewDate":"July 21, 2008","reviewText":"I previously owned the Canon Digital Rebel. I primarily upgraded to this camera for the additional pixels. Just in pixels alone, I effectively doubled my zoom rate, and it shows in bird closeups I've taken. Compared to my last camera, it's like trading in my 70-300 zoom on a 70-600 zoom. And picture quality is phenomenal, even when compared to the original Digital Rebel.\n\nBut the other enhancements to this camera make it worth buying even if it didn't sport a higher density CCD. I purchased an extra battery because the battery on the original Rebel ran down way too quickly and left me without a usable camera a few times. But I didn't need to. The battery on this model lasts forever. Maybe 10 times longer than the original!\n\nThis weekend I went on a bike ride with some friends. I was on vacation a couple of weeks ago and forgot to recharge the battery. I brought the extra along, but wanted to see how long the battery would last. I took a lot of pictures, then a friend of mine wanted to check out an image-stabilization lens I have. He spent an hour playing with the thing, taking more pictures and wasting battery power by testing out the image stabilization feature (something that normally uses a lot of juice). The battery still hasn't run down. I can't emphasize enough how bottomless the battery seems to me.\n\nHaving image-stabilization on the short lens was a nice feature. I didn't really need it because I use the zoom lens almost exclusively, but it's nice to know the feature's there if I ever do.\n\nFocus with my 70-300 zoom lens is much faster as well. Where the old one took up to a second or so, the new one focuses instantly when there's enough light. Even when there isn't enough light for a fast focus, it's still many times faster than the original.\n\nSomething else that surprised and excited me: Using the Sport mode, I used to be able to take only 4 pictures in succession before the buffer filled up. With the new camera in the same mode, I can take a lot more pictures in the same amount of time. Instead of only 4 pictures before the buffer is filled, the shutter keeps clicking away forever. I can't imagine any action shot that will be too long for the amount of pictures this thing can take now. I was showing the camera off to my brother-in-law, and I took at least 20 pictures (maybe 30 or 40?) in rapid succession before the buffer became full and it slowed down.\n\nThis camera is truly awesome. The friend that was demoing it was trying to justify his previous purchase of a non-SLR. He said, \"So this is more of a professional camera, huh?\" I told him, \"No--this is Canon's amateur line.\" And it is. But right now, I think it's better than their professional camera, which actually has 2 Megabits fewer pixels.\n\nIn the \"easy\" modes, the camera is a better photographer than I am. I'm no pro. But it would be nice to be able to choose when the flash is appropriate, or force a fill-flash when I want to.\n\nOther bennies: The screen is larger and brighter, but you can lower its brightness to improve battery life (I keep it cranked up all the way--this thing has plenty of battery life as I've said).\n\nCanon advertises that this thing will let you preview on the LCD now while focusing. If you want to buy this camera just because it's the only SLR you know of with that feature, don't. You might play with it for a couple of minutes, but you'll never use it to take actual pictures, because focus either doesn't work, or is excruciatingly slow. I had a lot of trouble figuring out how to turn this on, as well, and had to consult the manual.\n\nThere is another ease-of-use item I'd like to mention. You can turn off the flash in the easy modes if you want to. But you have to be in a creative mode to do it. I did that once, and it took me a long time to figure out how to turn the flash back on, because there's no menu item for it in the mode I was in (which was full-auto). I think it's idiotic that you can turn off the flash mode in full-auto from a creative mode, but not from the mode you're using.\n\nAll in all, I'm very glad I bought this camera."},{"reviewerName":"Angi","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great Entry Level Camera???","reviewDate":"March 17, 2009","reviewText":"I keep reading how this is a great entry level camera for the DSLR world.. But what about those of us who just want the DSLR photo quality with out going over a grand? I happen to fall into that category more so then the entry level one.. I admit I have purchased another lens for this camera and I have some filters and a tripod.. BUT in my point and shoot defense, it is just to get even a better shot...\nI have lived in a point and shoot world for about 8 years now.. I have always had great luck with Canon point and shoots so when I finally got to the point of desiring better quality photos then what my point and shoot could offer me. I ended up looking at the DSLR's. I wanted something to where I could set up the camera to do it's thing while I focused on whatever subject. I liked my preset settings on my point and shoot. And I wanted to keep them on next camera. I really wasn't and I am still not interested in aperture focal points or any of that other stuff. I wanted awesome pictures that I could share with family of mostly my dogs and vacation photos..\nAnd this camera provides it.. I am not or cannot sit here and write up a review telling you its strengths and weaknesses because honestly I don't see the weaknesses. For me I see awesome photo quality with the ability to do a whole lot more.. I do not foresee myself purchasing a new camera for a good 5 to 6 years.. I am hoping for more like 10 but we shall see.. Which is a lot better then the point and shoots which I was averaging about one every other year. Not because they would break but because photo quality would improve so much that I would end up moving to the next camera. This camera fits my needs as a weekend photographer and constant scrapbooker. And has photo quality that is close to actual 35mm.\nIt is a little too big for theme parks so I will always have some type of point and shoot.. Let me explain a little to big.. It is not huge by any means but when you are walking around a theme park you do not want to have a 600 dollar camera around your neck.. This camera does not fit into a pocket like most point and shoots therefore making it to me a bit of a burden to carry. Personally for myself I would rather just have the pocket point and shoot. You can also hold on to a point and shoot on a roller coaster a lot better then this camera.\nI LOVE this camera. And the photos it has taken..

The kit lens (EF-S 18-55 f/3.5-5.6 IS) is very good for the price. It is as sharp as lenses costing $700 to $1,000 and has only minimally greater barrel distortion and no vignetting to speak of. There is a little bit more chromatic aberration than with more expensive lenses, but again it completely acceptable, especially for the price. The autofocus and image stabilization work reliably and quickly. For aficionados of professional grade lenses, the build will seem light, but a light and small lens is also easier to carry around. Overall, a big improvement over earlier Canon kit lenses.\n\n2. The 12.2 megapixel sensor provides more than enough resolution. Even 8\"x12\" enlargements are highly satisfactory. We can look forward to the day when consumer-priced 35mm SLRs will have 30 megapixel full size sensors. At that point, the 35mm format will be maxed out in terms of resolution, as the lenses will not be able to keep up. In the meantime, this is as good as it gets. To give you an idea how good, on a shot of a 25 story building, every brick was clearly visible.\n\n3. The camera is fast enough for essentially all non-professional use. With natural lighting (no flash) it shoots 3.5 frames per second, perfect for capturing kids or sports action.\n\n4. Another great feature of the XSi is that it has all the manual controllability that advanced photographers want, but also has automatic modes that even a complete beginner can easily use. The performance of the preset automatic modes is surprisingly good under a wide range of conditions.\n\nHaving only had the XSi for a few weeks, I cannot yet say anything about the reliability of this new model. What I can report is that in more than 30 years of photography, I have found Canon products, both SLR and point and shoot, to be by far the most reliable. The Nikon, Olympus, and Pentax cameras I once owned have long since fallen by the wayside, but every Canon I have ever had, all the way back to a 1978 35 mm AT-1 SLR, is still going strong."},{"reviewerName":"H.

One has a lot of advanced features, but is only 4.0MP (and is 4 years old). The other is 8.0MP, but has super basic features (almost remedial). I wanted to step up to a DSLR camera to combine the best of options of my other two cameras, but have the ability to expand my options as I continue to learn photography without buying a new camera.\n\nI started out looking at the Canon Rebel T1i, which is an excellent camera, but was well-above my skill level. The XSi is still above my skill level at this point, but for the price, I could not pass up the opportunity to get an excellent camera that I could grown into. I received an great deal from my local warehouse club, which included two kit lenses (18-55mm and 55-250mm), a Canon gear bag (200DG) and a 2GB memory card.\n\nFrom just a few days of use, I have taken some excellent pictures right out of the box, and have had a chance to mess around with some of the advanced features, which also produced great results.\n\nThe camera feels great in my hands (which are somewhat small) and is not too heavy, even with the zoom lens attached. The functions are easily adjusted without having to fumble through several levels in the menu.\n\nThe only drawback that I found with this camera is the extremely limited functions available in the full auto mode. For example, it may just be me, but I like using the LCD screen to take pictures sometimes. However, this option is not available in the Full Auto mode. You have to switch to one of the creative modes, for this option to be available. This purely an inconvenience, and is probably just an indication that I need to continue learning more about this camera, so I can get out of the Full Auto mode more often.\n\nI would not recommend this camera for a casual shooter that is not willing to take the extra time to learn the advanced features. You could probably save a lot of money by just buying an advanced point-and-shoot camera that takes good pictures in Full Auto mode versus spending the extra money for features that you will never use."},{"reviewerName":"M. Heltsley","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"great camera, lots of perks, one problem","reviewDate":"August 28, 2008","reviewText":"Love it. I purchased this as soon as it came out. That was my only mistake. That cost me $180. I can get it now for $180 less than I paid. That hurts. I have only had it for since February. I should have known better than to buy it that soon.\n\nWith that being said, has it been worth the $180 extra? Every cent. I have taken better pictures with this than I have ever taken before. That includes on old SLR film cameras, point and shoot film, APS and a half dozen other point and shoot digitals. This camera beats its predecessors in every way, it beats the comparable Nikon, Sony, Olympus, and Pentax models in almost everyway and it has a great following on Ebay to boot, so finding extras is easy.\n\nThe pictures are outstanding, especially for an entry level model. The lens kit was nice, but I wish I had skipped it (and the 70-300 non IS I got as a bonus deal) and ponied up for a Sigma 18-200 OS lens and the Canon 50mm f/1.4 right off the bat. But you live and learn, and those other lenses are nice enough, but the camera is too good for them. The pictures don't look as good as they could with better glass.\n\nI have taken 20000+ shots already, about 1/2 were crap. But that was my fault not the camera, it can only do so much. That means that the shutter, the memory card, the buttons, the lenscap, everything has been through 20000 pictures. And it is no worse for wear. I use it as much as I can, I take it everywhere as i have done with all my cameras before, it gets banged, dropped, sat on, etc. It has never even hiccuped due to a problem I caused.\n\nWith that being said it has had problems of its own. The kit lens had a hard time early on with focus, it is a known bug with a known workaround involving dismantling the camera waiting a bit and then reassembling it again. Pretty easy to do, but since you don't know when it is going to happen or when it has happened it is pretty scary as any given picture (and then all others there after) could be \"soft focused\". Once you take it apart and put it back together it fixes the issue and all is right with the world again, but none the less, this is a HUGE problem that almost made me take it back. The problem only happened once though, and I no longer use the kit lens so I am not as worried about it. Plus I check my shots for focus after the fact anyhow, so now I know to look for a pattern of soft focus. If found I know to fix it ASAP. I have not had to use this bandaid since the first time, but I have it in my bag of tricks. I debated and gave it 5 stars despite this because I believe this will be fixed in firmware soon, and it can be worked around thus not affecting the vast majority of users. If that were fixed, once and for all, this would be one heck of a great camera.\n\nHell it is one great camera, it is amazing and outstanding and impresses me, and most everyone who sees my photos, each time I use it. I plan to put it to good use for many years to come. Which by then it will have lost all its value and i will upset that at one point I paid $850 more than i could get it for. Until then though I highly recommend this camera to anyone and everyone, unless you are rich enough to afford the upcoming 50d which frankly puts this in its place."},{"reviewerName":"Arno Vosk","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Excellent \"entry level\" digital SLR","reviewDate":"June 17, 2010","reviewText":"Being a devotee of film photography, an advanced amateur who spent a lot of time in the darkroom, I moved into digital only gradually and reluctantly. My first purchase was a Canon compact, and this was the second digital camera I bought. I've owned it for a year now. I think it's wonderful. I find it very straightforward to use. This is real praise from someone used to a Leica M6, which has nothing automatic and only 3 controls--focus, shutter speed and f-stop. It takes good pictures set on auto, and the controls and menus on other settings (I use program, and other more manual settings--hardly ever the more automatic ones like portrait or landscape) are easy to understand, if you know a little about photography. The standard zoom lens that comes with the camera is not great, but takes decent pictures stopped down, and has the advantage of being lightweight. I've since purchased better, and heavier, lenses. Are these as good as my Elmars, my Zeiss Tessars and Goerz Dagors? Well, no, but they're very decent. The camera feels well built (again, major praise from a person accustomed to Leica), and I disagree with those who say it feels insubstantial (what, do they want it to be even heavier?).\n\nMy photos turn out nicely, with minimal tweaking necessary in Photoshop Elements. I haven't yet made any huge enlargements, so I'm not able to comment on that aspect of printing, but I display pictures on my large screen tv and am very happy with their appearance. So the pros might look down on this \"beginner's\" camera, but I intend to hang onto it, and I would recommend it without hesitation."},{"reviewerName":"Mick","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"What a deal!!","reviewDate":"January 8, 2009","reviewText":"I am a relative newbie to the digital camera scene.

I am having a lot of fun with it! Easy, intuitive and great pics... even with the kit lens. I also tried it out with the canon 50mm f/1.8 and it was sharp both outdoors and in. With a fast lens you can capture some nice action shots. I have posted a few photos here at Amazon that I recently snapped on the beach at Port Aransas.\nI have not tried all the features yet, e.g., the custom WB feature, but the ISO settings and exposure settings are easy to find and set. There is a custom menu option called 'My Menu' that you can create to keep your 5 favorite settings easily accessible.\nIt would be nice to be able to access the picture quality settings, such as the sharpness setting, using a button or at the top level of a menu, but at this price I am not going to complain!\nI have taken over 350 high resolution JPGs so far without having to recharge the battery. The viewfinder is adequate - certainly better than a lot of other cameras I have used. Live view is still problematic in digital slrs, so don't expect what you find in a point and shoot. The LCD is nice, but not even close to the nice LCDs on the Nikon D90 and D300. However it is certainly adequate - even outside on a sunny winter day.\nThe WB does seem suspect indoors regardless of the setting - but that is a common fault of dslr cameras.\nThe 18-55 IS lens that comes with the kit is no slouch either. I definitely recommend getting the kit. In fact, the 2 lens kit is a great bargain right now at Bh & Adorama.\n\nThe only negative so far is a a single spot of dust on the sensor that won't come off with the camera's self-cleaning system.

It really helps to narrow down the best choice based on user experience,complexity, ease of use, features and value.\n\nI was a newbie to Digital SLR cameras and got educated by reading these reviews and a book on how to shoot. 18 months later I am happy to report this was a fantastic purchase. It is true, if you have a few extra bucks, get this one vs. the XTI. I've never had any device, let alone a camera, have this long a battery life. I purchased a 4 gb card with the extra speed rating and it is an absolute pleasure to shoot rapid shots. It gets the kids in that perfect moment every time - and you have tons of shots to choose from, as it stores the images very quickly and moves on to the next shot almost instantly. I also upgraded from the stock lens provided with the body, which was total junk - to a Canon image stabilizer lens, which I didn't have to break the bank for. I got the most incredible shots of wildlife on Assateague Island, Virginia you could ever imagine while riding on the boat!\n\nIt is a time saver to.

I would stick with a Class 4 or Class 6 SDHC memory card.\n\nWhile not a professional photographer, from the technical aspect of combining this unit with a PC and their software, they've provided a nice solution. The software is fairly decent, not the best, but does the job. Bundle it with Adobe Lightroom or just a simple Google Picasa and you are good to go with managing your photos.\n\nBoth Lightroom and Picasa can view the RAW images and touch-up with this file format is exceptional. The CameraWindow software and bundled utilities allows you to use a laptop to control the camera and settings, preview images on a larger screen, and instantly store into RAW/JPG file formats to disk. This is a big bonus when in a studio environment.\n\nTheir Zoombrowser image viewer is very functional and usable. While I'm now using Picasa and Lightroom to manage the images, Zoombrowser is certainly capable for any novice to intermediate user.\n\nI use a 50mm lens, 18-200mm IS lens, and 580II flash as my primary equipment.

It's much more sophisticated than the original one so it takes some working with it to learn its new features. I highly recommend Julie Adair King's book: Canon EOS Digital XSi/450D for Dummies, available at Amazon. It goes into much more detail and suggestions than you are likely to find elsewhere or in the Canon material. Also, there's a nice review at [...]\nOne common complaint with the XSi is that it comes with a rather \"soft\" default focus, which may disappoint. In fact, it comes set at \"3\" with settings available up to \"7\" for the \"standard\" picture setting. Once you learn the camera this can be changed, and will work with any modes other than \"auto\". I have mainly been using the \"P\" mode. I also find I get a much sharper focus not using the 9-point focusing, but rather, in the \"P\" mode use the center (locked in) focusing point. My first few days with it I was frustrated and disappointed with the soft focus. Now that I read the \"Dummies\" book and understand the camera better, all is well.

I can get as close as 3 inches to something and take a clear photograph of it. It makes photographing the garden a lot more fun.\n\nThe precision focusing and quick flickerflash are bonus items as well. It's so fast and accurate and so far, I've taken well over 2,000 shots and haven't had red eye in any one of them. Most of the time I don't even need a flash since the automatic setting will adjust the light as I need it, including an extended aperture which will give more light in a low light situation as long as I hold the camera very still (or use a tripod).\n\nAs a portrait photographer, I love this camera as well. Without the flash, I can take a very clear photograph of someone and have their skin tone glow and their eyes clear and focused. With the flash, it doesn't bleach them out and as I already mentioned, red eye has so far not been a concern.\n\nI absolutely recommend this camera to anyone wanting to improve their shots.

Many of my pictures come out \"so-so\" right now and marginally better than my point and shoot. Spending a little time to get off the autofocus and use manual controls yielded pictures that far surpassed my old 7MP Nikon when dealing with moving objects, which was my primary challenge. I am concerned with the 50,000 picture rating for the shutter since I've already shot 800 pictures in just the first 20 days of owning this camera (you can shoot a lot at a sporting event) but, for the price, it was unbeatable with a decent, versatile stock lens. I'm now realizing the limitations of the lens and what separates the low from the high but this camera is a learning experience for anyone who doesn't really shoot at a high level. It will require you to invest the time to get excellent pictures out. You'll be disappointed like myself in the same way getting a great HDTV brings out the limtiations of standard cable. But look at it this way - once you start learning about the basics, e.g. the relationship of ISO to aperture to shutter speed and setting the priority mode, etc. you're on your way to pictures that are far superior to your point and shoot and difficult to go back. Apparently it doesn't have all the fine settings of the 40D nor the 100K shutter rating but I'm not sure it matters at this price. If you want a sub-$800 SLR with a decent stock lens, there is no better camera, and I was hoping the Nikon D60 would be my choice. Not so.

Paired with good lenses the XSI/450D can provide jaw-dropping images with incredible detail. Overall shooting speed is very, very good and the viewfinder is generously sized. The LCD is large and bright.\n\nAs there are a large number of reviews of the Rebel XSI already, I'll attempt to detail the few negative aspects of the camera so prospective owners can decide if any of them are deal-breakers for their specific needs.\n\n-Body Construction. The XSI is built almost entirely of high density plastic and feels more flimsy to me than the Nikons. The plastic LCD cover is quite exposed and probably needs an after-market screen protector. Like many entry level SLRs There is no auxiliary settings/metering LCD on the top of the camera (the viewfinder does give you a good amount of info). The battery compartment appears to be relatively fragile when opened.\nIf weather sealing and robustness are paramount, the Pentax K200D is more solidly built at a slightly lower price point.\n\n-Auto White Balance. While you can readily correct this issue with custom WB settings, the fact remains that under the fluorescent light setting (& often Auto) the XSI is off color balance wise. With Live View it is obvious that there's too much red/yellow under fluorescent. Incandescent is better but not perfect. Tungsten seems very good, and during daylight hours the WB seems excellent. Nikon may have slightly fewer problems with some default settings, but I believe most manufacturers have some WB issues out of the box.\n\n-Auto-Focus and AV. The versatile eleven point auto focus is generally very quick, but occasionally freaks out. Distance AF can be inaccurate at times in bright light. Exposure Compensation goes to + or - 2 at maximum. Continuous drive mode has an upper limit of exposures even in JPEG mode.\n\n-Hand grip. The XSI grip is relatively short and less secure in my large hands than the Nikons, Pentaxes and Sonys I've tried. While the grip is relatively comfortable, it's small size means I'm gripping the camera with my middle and ring fingers, bracing the bottom with my little finger. A hand strap might come in handy, but the Opteka feels too flimsy for my taste.\n\n-Kit Lens. The 18-55 EF-S lens is a big step up from a P&S camera, but not especially impressive by SLR standards. By Nikon/Canon kit lens standards it is good, and the image stabilization works quite nicely. Were I to buy the camera today I might forgo the kit lens altogether and jump right in to a 28mm prime, keeping my f1.8 II 50mm. The difference in image quality between the f1.8 II 50mm and the kit lens is noticeable. Remember the 1.6x crop factor (50mm effectively ~80mm for example) due to the APS-C sized sensor.\n\n-Default JPEG settings. The default JPEG settings are good, but seem a bit less saturated and a bit sharper than typical for Canon. This can be readily adjusted of course. RAW is flawless.\n\n-Live View is limited and cannot be used in Auto mode. Live view shuts off the viewfinder entirely (except during AF) and is limited in the modes it can use. The Olympus Live View is reputedly better implemented, but the 400/500 series viewfinders are smaller. For tripod use, the XSI Live View with image magnification and manual focus could be indispensable.\n\n-Proprietary Li-Ion battery. The 450D uses a (long-lasting) 7.4V 1080mAH Canon battery and includes a charger; replacements are not cheap and third-party versions can be inferior. Nearly all other manufacturers also use expensive proprietary packs, with the K200D being one exception.\n\nAbsent from these small flaws, the Rebel XSI is a truly great camera with good features and a sensor that can really make make use of top-notch lenses. Versatile and compact, the XSI is more than enough camera for almost anyone."},{"reviewerName":"Colts Fan","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Our First DSLR","reviewDate":"October 15, 2009","reviewText":"I purchased this camera for my wife who like to take pictures of her garden plants and the dishes she cooks up.

I researched review sites and liked what I read about the Canon Rebel XSi. It met all of the criteria and the price was very reasonable. I purchased an extra macro lens for her.\n\nWe've had the camera for about a year now and we've taken thousands for photos and they all look amazing.

The camera starts up instantly and takes the picture I want with no lag. While shooting sports, lag is always an issue, I have detected none.\nThe battery is excellent. I was a little apprehensive over the case being plastic. My old camera was an A2E and it was built like a tank. Then I started thinking how they build planes out of plastic, so that concern was negated (at least in my head, and I was going from a tank to plane) so I bought it. Now I love the light weight of this camera and it's no longer an issue \"lugging\" it around. If you just want to shoot decent shots keep the 18-55mm lens on it. It's a feather, but this is a starter lens. When you get more money you will at some time want to upgrade it, there should be no rush as it's a very capable lens and it has image stabilization. (Hey, who makes better glass than Canon?)\nNow for my real only complaint. When I first started using this camera I noticed I was not using the setting I thought I was. When I was shutting off the camera my finger was rubbing against the exposure wheel and it was changing the setting.

Going from point and shoot to this camera I was concerned I wouldn't like shooting through the view finder (although the camera has the live view function, you get better control of the camera by using the view finder as you get the auto focus points only through the view finder) but I have had the camera for 2 weeks and have used the live view maybe one time. Shooting through the view finder isn't bad at all, but if you need to use the live view for positioning the camera above your head or near the ground, the live view works well for that.

I own a point and shoot camera as well (Sony W280) and got sick of the blurring and noise that you get at higher ISOs. So I decided to go with a DSLR. Not knowing what to purchase I just went with the two largest brands, Nikon and Canon and looked at the features and ended up going with the Rebel XSI due to the price at the time (it was on sale). Honestly though, this camera is amazing, being able to do high motion and low light shots with a high ISO without having the image look like you sprayed it with red dust confetti is awesome. I've recommended this to several of my friends who are going to get one as soon as they have the money to spend.\n\nIf you're considering a DSLR, I would seriously consider the XSI. I also recommend it for people just going into DSLR photography. It truly is an awesome unit.\n\nThe biggest issue I have with it though is the transferring of pictures through the given USB cord. I went on a safari with friends and took about 1300 pictures and while the pictures were gorgeous, just getting them onto my macbook via USB was a pain. Apparently it goes through all of the pictures on the camera then connects itself as a device on the machine. My tip... use an external SD card reader.

It is very easy to change the settings in the camera so that I do not have to do much post production work. Most of the time, I don't need to do any post production. I have only used two lenses with this so far; the 18-55mm kit lens, and a 50mm f/1.8 lens. The kit lens is not my favorite, but when I need to get in a bit tighter, it does the job. It has image stabilization, which does not seem to really work for me. Perhaps it is because I have quite shaky hands, but it doesn't work for me very well, though I am not sure how much any lens image stabilizer would work at a shutter speed of 45.\n\nI have been able to take some wonderful photographs with this camera, and don't think I will be needing an upgrade for another few years.

Those of you who are familiar with the Canon menu systems on their point and shoot cameras will find it very easy to make the transition to the XSi - it uses the same menu based systems you have been using.\n\nThe decision to go with with Canon XSi was based on the assumption that the DSLRs are going to continue to get better and better over the next few years and rather than make a heavy investment in the camera it was better to buy a reasonably priced camera and plan to upgrade over time and use some of the cash that could have been spent on a camera to buy quality glass for the camera.\n\nThere are a number of reviews on the web that highlight the excellent quality of the image sensor on the XSi and they all suggest that the sensor is better than the stock lens on the camera. My suggestion is that don't buy the lens that comes with the camera, unless you want to sell it on EBay, and make the investment in lenses to go with the camera.\n\nIn terms of the shooting quality I have been using the camera for the past month and have been very impressed with the images taken. They are far superior to point and shoot images and are comparable to the 35mm that I have been used to.\n\nFor those of you with big hands the camera body is very small in the hand and you may want to consider buying the optional battery grip that comes with the camera to make it easier for the camera to fit in your hand.

I've always had two major problems with point-n-shoot cameras. First, I always had to take 2-3 pictures for something to come out decent. It seemed that even if shooting in the same modes the color definition was always different in each picture taken. Second, it was a real challenge for me to capture objects in motion, most came out blurry; again I had to shoot 4,5+ times to get one acceptable result.\n\nOn the contrary, I decided to spend 900 bux and get this camera. It simply refuses to break pictures. I've taken pictures from busses out the window while in motion, i've taken pictures at fast moving objects, and it just refuses to break focus. I'm extremely surprised at how well it behaves, even in auto mode. It all feels like a dream.\n\nThe next thing i tried is the macro mode function at the Botanical Garden; and you can see some sample photos - the blue flower is one of the best :) I took about 5 pictures of each flower, because that's how I used to do it in the past. I shouldn't have. Each picture came out clear and sharp, however, keeping in mind that the kit lens is not really a macro lens, while shooting the really small flowers, there was some blurr, which is totally understandable. Some things are just too small to capture the details with the kit lens, not the camera's fault.\n\nAnother nice feature is the ability to update the firmware yourself, which we all know improves stability, adds new functionality, and, if there are any, corrects any software bugs.\n\nThe build quality is really solid too. It feels as solid as a rock, but not as heavy :)\n\nLastly, the battery. I haven't drained the battery but I have taken about 230 pictures, about 30 of those were at night with the flash. By the end of the day, I was still running with a full battery. So while I can't say exactly how many shots u can get on a full charge, I can confirm that the battery does not get exhausted easily.\n\nOverall, if you have the money to spend and new to SLR's I would definately recommend this camera.

This lens is much improved from the last generation and is even optically better than the Canon 17-85mm IS lens that costs many times more. Even if you decide that the kit lens is not for you, you can resell it for much more than $60.\nSo why only four stars? Well, It seems that the latest Canon digital SLRs have a little bit of problem with dead pixels. Mine developed one after a few hundred of shots. Given that there are 12 million pixels, one dead pixel is very hard to see unless you really zoom it in. I mean this is like locating one red-head person from the Tokyo population. Nonetheless, it is annoying when you know that there is a dead pixel. Fortunately, Canon's manual sensor cleaning function also has a firmware program to detect and mask the deal pixels with information copied from an adjacent pixel. You just have to turn the camera into the manual sensor cleaning mode for enough time (30-60 seconds) for the program to checkout the whole pixel map. It fixed my dead pixel problem like a charm.

After last year's Rebel Xti, which didn't improve much from its predecessor, the Canon EOS Rebel Xsi is upgraded with better body design, performance, and image quality. After 20 years of EOS investments, the Xsi successfully proves Canon's technological capability in expanding its market for both professionals and amateurs. Finally, with its news specs, the Xsi is a product of great value at an affordable price.\nFirst off, the new XSi has a new inspired design: either a solid black or a less attractive two-tone silver and black. Slightly larger than the Xti, it has a smooth plastic body with a better grip. Most of th buttons lie under the right hand, in which each feels different so that they are easy to recognize without looking. Moreover, the Xsi does not require a two-handed operation. In addition to the grip, the 3-inch LCD is larger and 50% brighter with a redesigned control layout. A grid-line and live histogram help with shot composition and exposure. Available for the first time on the Canon DSLR market, the Live View mode also helps the photographer to shoot from different angles.\nEasy operation is a definite guarantee with the new Xsi. The new focus capabilities are astounding with two new auto focus features available. In addition, the new menu is more personal, which can build a go-to list of your frequently accessed settings. You can play with the ISO sensitivity or your Live View settings for example.\nLet's not forget to mention the product's enhanced image quality. The 12 megapixel delivers better resolution. Like the Xti, the 9-point user selectable autofocus system is still better than the Nikon D60's 3 point focus. The XSi also includes the very cool High Light Tone Priority, which provides better tonal detail in various settings. In regards to exposure modes, the Auto Lighting Optimizer adjusts contrast and brightness. The Xsi also has the usual easy to control shutter speeds, exposure, white balance, metering, and six pre-set modes, which all deliver superior color accuracy, dynamic range, sharpness/ menial grain, and reduced noise.\nIn addition to the great image quality, the other specs are helpful too but no different from the Xti. The CMOS for example, a signature spec of Canon products, amplifies each pixel site and contributes to longer battery life. The EOS Integrated Cleaning system is also another unique spec, which reduces, repels, and removes dust.\nAll in all, the Xsi, is certainly an improved product, surpassing and different from the features of other DSLRs. It is versatile, easy-to-use, and reasonably priced."},{"reviewerName":"B. ong","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Lived up to the hype","reviewDate":"September 9, 2008","reviewText":"PROs: I am thrilled with this camera. After doing some research for a couple of months between this camera, the nikon d80 and the prestigious canon 40d, I decided on the XSi for my needs. Best overall price to my performance needs. Image quality is fantastic, even though the kit lens is at best, good. Going to purchase a 50mm 1.4, 70-200 4L, and a better walk around lens as soon as I get completely sick of the 18-55 IS kit lens, but for now its a good starter lens. Though I honestly think the nikon d80 and the 40d are better cameras for experienced and serious users, primarily I am loyal to Canon (best brand) and the 40d is just too bulky and expensive for me. I don't need all the extra bells and whistles provided by the 40d at this point of my life.\nIf you want a light, easy to use and learn (for first time users), long lasting battery (about 500 images), nice clear LCD and fairly cheap price to performance ratio this camera blows out all nikons, pentax, and sony's out there for the beginner/transitioning to intermediate shooters. I chose this camera over the 40d because its more suitable for me and most importantly I can use the price difference between the XSi and the 40d to get my 70-200 4L for free basically.\n\nCons: Again the common gripe over the grip, but honestly its not that bad if you have small to medium size hands. you will adapt quickly as the pro's of the camera immediately mask any cons present. No better kit lens option out yet.\n\nOverall: Fantastic lens for beginner/beginner-intermediate users as the vast majority of professional reviews have stated...\n\nNote: Please get a nice memory card I recommend the 4 or 8GB SanDisk EXTREME III (it's worth the extra $5-10) or any SDHC that is class 6, save a little change for some other lenses as you will fall in love with this camera and will be compelled to buy more lenses, and lastly buy some decent filters as you will appreciate the image quality and protection they provide. the RC-1 is a nice accessory.

Always liked the XSi since the 2008 introduction and it was a perfect storm to buy it just as it was being discontinued. Bought the camera new, with the 18-55 kit lens, on Amazon for ($549). I purchased a couple of non Canon spare batteries, a UV filter for the kit lens and two Patriot class 10, 8gb SDHC card ($17.99/ea at Fry's). Since then I have added through the local Craigslist a Lowpro Rezo 180AW bag for $20, a \"nifty fify\" f1.8 Canon with UV filter for $70, a 55-250 f4-5.6 with UV filter for $175, and a 430 EXII for $200. Yes I would like to have some better lenses, but the speedlight is by far my best investment. My indoor \"baby\" shots are awesome. Bounce flash (and off camera flash) has taken my \"snap shots\" to a whole other level.\nI have about a $1100 in my kit and enjoy it everyday.

I wanted to get a \"very nice\" camera, but one that I would also be able to use. I purchased this camera the day before leaving to Thailand on my honeymoon. It was great, and the pictures (about 3000 over two weeks) turned out great! It was easy to use, durable and the pictures came out crystal clear. I read the manual over the 20+ hour flight and learned a lot about the features of the camera. It was comfortable in my hands, and I even taught my technologically deficient wife how to use it once I was comfortable with it myself! The pictures from our honeymoon were applied to my slideshow screen saver on my computer and as my friends looked at them, they thought the pictures looked like post cards, and didn't believe that we took the pictures and figured that the screen saver came standard on the computer!\n\nI will say this, originally I figured that the screen would have live viewing and you would not be forced to look through the eye piece (similar to most point-and-shoot cameras of today). However, it was not as annoying as I thought, and I'm not certain if any higher end SLR cameras have this feature (or at least any under $1000). Aside from that, the camera was great, pictures were great, and it was easy to use! I'm sure that there are 100's of features I'm not sure of how to use, but if I have up to it, I'm sure that I can figure it out. The manual constantly said that it's easier to use the automatic focus options, which I did, and had no complaints!\n\nI would recommend this camera to anyone that likes to vacation, or has children in sports and wants to take great pictures. This camera is one of the most recent to come out. And I cannot wait to get a higher zoom lens and a wide angle lens for Christmas!\n\nHope this helps to the amateurs out there!"},{"reviewerName":"P.

I liked this camera as an improvement over my previous Powershot. The SLR offered the focusing and lens possibilities I had experienced with my film Elan camera. However, I found the Canon XT did not do well in low-light situations and that it did not handle situations with varied lighting very well.\n\nThe new Canon XSi is a VAST improvement over the XT and well worth the investment. Photos are much sharper. The XSi easily adapts to all types of lighting situations. Also its new larger LCD screen is much easier to use. This camera feels more substantial in the hand, and I find all the buttons smartly placed for ease of use.\n\nI might add that I have added the 55-250mm IS lens to the 18-55mm IS lens.

I am one of them. After years of Point and Shoot camera use thinking the convenience of carrying them and using them was worth it, I came to the realization that I wasn't happy with most of the pictures I took. They preserved the moment but almost none of them were worth blowing up or printing. Mediocre flash, zoom, megapixels, etc limited me and the pictures.\n\nI love all the features of this camera for the price, especially the dedicated ISO button on top and the menu system is very easy to figure out, and the 3 inch LCD screen. There is also the switch to SD memory cards which are apparently easier to use than CF. It is so easy to take the card out, put it in an SD USB card reader, load the pictures and return the card to the camera, rather than have to fiddle around with opening the little door on the camera and connecting a cable from it to the PC.\n\nIf you are contemplating buying your first DSLR you must remember that the camera is just the start. You will need to invest in a quality external flash to improve your flash pictures. And there is the various zoom lens, that now utilize Image or Optical Stabilization, a technology worth the extra cost. I was happy to do all this and I am absolutely satisfied with this camera and the Canon lens and flash as well.

With film, I get very graceful degradation (grain). With digital, low light noise is not as pleasing as pushed 400-speed film. I also seem to get more chromatic aberration with digital. Finally, I really dislike the smaller sensor on digital SLRs. It makes all my lenses more telephoto, and increases my depth of field quite a bit. I miss how my 50mm/1.8 EF lens looked wide open; the ability to really blur the immediate background came in handy.\n\nIt takes an impressive digital SLR to make up for these issues. The XTi has been my first digital SLR, and I haven't yet gone back to film. Besides the convenience of processing (with Lightroom), the XTi performs well. Its low-light sensitivity, on-camera JPG processing, form factor, and interface all work well for me. The biggest feature I'm missing is a decent spot metering mode. I still break out my Pentax spotmeter (1 degree) occasionally--although with digital, it is just not as much fun as using the zone system and waiting for the negatives."},{"reviewerName":"Gregory Balzer","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Should Have Moved to a Digital SLR Earlier","reviewDate":"June 8, 2009","reviewText":"First SLR owned since my old film Canon TLb about 30 years ago. This camera, together with books by Scott Kelby, Videos [...]. and the Strobist website have reignited my passion for photography. The best thing about a Digital camera is the instant feedback loop. Now I can experiment with various apertures, shutter speed settings, compositions and flash settings and get back instantaneous feedback. And you can take as many shots as you want and then just delete then if you don't have any winners. Digital SLRs really speed up the learning process.\n\nThe XSi is a great camera, and Canon produces a great variety of lenses. The only area that I am less than impressed is with off-camera flash where Nikon MAY have a slight edge.

I am not a hardcore amateur and consider myself more interested in documenting the growth of my two daughters with quality photographs then I am about the techinical art of photography. Throwing it up and there, shooting, and having a reasonable outcome is my primary objective. I am also fully aware that beauty is in the eye of the beholder and I certainly do not want to take anything away not from those people who do. I appreciate and respect beautiful photographic work. For my situation however, I looked at several different cameras in this price range and settled on Canon. Primarily because I had a Canon A1 for years and always thought highly of their cameras and lenses. I looked at the Olympus E520 and probably would have bought the D90 if I had wanted to spend that much money. I think the XSi was ultimately the best value. I placed my order through Amazon and eargerly awaited its delivery. I received it in time for Christmas and out of the box was able to figure out enough about the camera to get some great Christmas shots of my two girls. Once I came inside however...there were problems immediately. When operating in lighting environments where the flash was required the camera failed alsmost continually. This was manifested by Err 99 messsages in the viewfinder. This as maddening especially with all the nieces and nephews over for Christmas morning gift unwrapping. I finally had to abandon the the XSi and revert back to my wife's point and click. A dubiouos beginning to say the least. Later, a little reserach on the internet and I found that many other XSi customers had similar issues with this camera. There are various remedies posted on various websites but mine was to return the camera to Amazon for a replacement. This part of the experience was outstanding. I requested a replacement on Friday and my new XSi arrived the following Monday. Amazon did not wait for the return of the broken camera and paid for the price of return shipping as well. Out of the box I see now that my new camera works much better. There is slight pause when you fire off multiple frames under flash. The camera will say BUSY but will not lock as the other one did and this passes in maybe 2 seconds. All in all..I am happy with the experience and was happy that Amazon did such a good job getting a working camera to me. Oh..one more thing....I bought the \"Dummies Guide to the Canon XSi\" ....that is a very nice companion to the purchase of this camera and possibly the most beautiful \"Dummies Guide to ....\" that I have ever seen."},{"reviewerName":"Chalko","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Excellent SLR for beginners","reviewDate":"December 27, 2010","reviewText":"For those of you wanting to step up to an SLR from a point and shoot camera, you definitely cannot go wrong with this camera.\nI have owned this camera for almost two years now and have nothing that I am disappointed about.\n12.2 Megapixels are more than adequate for most of your shooting needs. You can blow these images up to 16 by 20 without any issue.\nIf you are jumping up from a point and shoot camera, you will definitely be impressed with the all the customizable settings available with this camera. It can take a little time to learn by playing around with all the settings but you will find it to be thoroughly enjoyable as you discover how the image changes be tweaking the settings.\nAs compared to the newer T1i and T2i, if shooting video is not a priority to you...then I would save a little cash and go with the XSi. In terms of the improvements made in those two newer cameras with respect to photography, I don't feel like you will notice too large of a difference. However, if being able to take video is important than obviously jumping up to one of those two cameras will be necessary.\nOverall, a great entry level SLR camera!!"},{"reviewerName":"Chiu Kwan","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Should you trade-in for the T1i?","reviewDate":"May 1, 2009","reviewText":"I've been using the Canon Rebel XSi for about half a year.\nQuestion to all XSi and XS users, \"Should I trade-in my XSi/XS for an T1i?\"\n\nAnswers all vary and depends what you need.\n\n1. Overall I think the Canon Rebel XSi is a very very good camera. It has more than enough megapixel as a regular digital camera. It is also very affordable and comes with its own lens.\n\n2. The screen is pretty amazing but not as clear as the T1i which has 920,000 pixel on it. But, that doesn't really matter.\n\n3. Picture taking, I think that the XSi actually take sharper and clearer images than the T1i. Probably because the T1i has more megapixel and if you use 18-55mm lens, it will actually show that the 18-55mm lens is pretty cheap when taking pictures. I also tried on the 50mm on both camera, pretty good result but XSi just a tiny little bit sharper. And when you reach ISO 1600 on the T1i, it get pretty noisy. T1i just a bit noisy than the XSi. When you reach ISO 3200, things get pretty loud and you would like one of those expensive lens that take silent pictures. Overall the T1i and XSi picture taking is almost the same. XSi if you want silent pictures and T1i if you want ISO 3200 or more.\n\n4. Liveview, I see no difference and both look the same and take the same picture quality. So no problem there.\n\n5. Digi Processor, the T1i has an upgraded processor, probably because 15 megapixel is a lot and takes time to save it into the memory card. But, the XSi may have a downgraded processor but it still save the picture at the same time as T1i. So there also no problem there.\n\n6. HD record on the T1i is pretty amazing when is on 720p. But if you 1080p I recommend getting a video recorder. dSLR aren't really meant for taking HD record and I would highly recommend that if you need to record video, I would go for a video recorder that can take true HD. Also, worst part about the HD record, the sound is pretty lousy. There is NO PLUGIN for a mic for the T1i. So not recommend if your using the HD record taking a speech.\n\nOverall I think the T1i is a pretty good camera. But there's no reason to trade in your XSi/XS for a T1i unless you really need that ISO or the HD recorder. I think the T1i should be $50 cheaper because the only thing I see in the T1i compare to the XSi/XS is the megapixel and the HD recorder. I would recommend getting the D90 if you have a bit more money to record HD. D90 not only record HD but it take pretty good pictures compare to T1i.\nIf you want more information heres a link comparing D90 and T1i: [...]\n\nResource: I own Canon Rebel XSi, Canon Rebel XS, Canon Rebel T1i, Canon 5D Mark II, and Nikon D90.\n(Note: I rarely use Nikon D90 probably cause I have more lens for canons.)"},{"reviewerName":"K.

I decided to go to the digital SLR since I am going to have daughter in a couple of months and the cost of film and developing is crazy. The lenses on my EOS 3 were interchangeable with the new digital Rebel lens mounting system. This was one of the main reasons that I stuck with Canon. Keeping the lenses and flash I already had saved me about $1000. I have the Canon EF 75-300mm f/4-5.6 IS USM Telephoto Zoom Lens for Canon, the Canon 24-85/3.5-4.5 EF USM Black Zoom Lens Canon AF Zoom Lens and a Canon Speedlite 380EX. All of these products work very well with with the new digital system.\n\nI have had this camera for about 30 days and have taken around 500-750 shots. I mainly take landscape/nature and portraits. The quality is excellent. I have taken a whole lot of photos of my dogs and while hiking in the mountains, I live in Arizona. The camera's automatic shooting modes are pretty good but if you can take the time to learn how to use the manual Av and Tv modes this camera is AWESOME!\n\nI just bought a new portrait lens, the Canon EF Lens - 50 mm - F/1.8 - Canon EF. It is Canon's lower quality model with the plastic mounting system of lenses but it is very, very good for natural light portraits. As long as you don't need a portrait lens for professional use, this lens is great.\n\nThis camera picks up every detail and is unbelievable at 12mp. I bought a 8gig SD card to go with it for about $10 shipped. It was the Transcend 8 GB SDHC Class 6 Flash Memory Card TS8GSDHC6. I found it on Amazon. It holds about 1300 pictures at 12mp. It is a great combo for the Rebel body.\n\nI highly recommend this camera. It has very easy to use manual and automatic settings. It has cool features like live view and depth of field preview too."},{"reviewerName":"LightsCA","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great Beginner DSLR - Features, Hardware, Etc","reviewDate":"December 20, 2008","reviewText":"I purchased this product as a present for myself for Christmas including the 18-55 IS kit lens. I have owned numerous P&S cameras - Casio, Canon, Nikon, etc, but decided it was finally time to upgrade to a DSLR - and at a great price. I have taken about 500 pictures so far - with flash, with manual controls, in auto mode, pretty much everything already.\n\nThe Camera body - very solid build. I had read some reviews which were critical of the use of plastic over metal but I really think that the plastic is great. I'm sure a drop would damage it in some way, but the plastic feels very sturdy and has no flex in the body at all. Every compartment opens and closes tight and with some resistance, which gives a very stable feeling. The buttons all feel great to press. The shutter feels very sturdy and has great feedback when you press it. The camera body is a good size for me. I am taller than average but not giant and my hands are pretty good sized and even the smaller body on this camera (compared to the 40,50d, etc) feels fine. My only complaint is sometimes tiredness which I get in my right pinky finger from the grip on the camera. I'm sure in the coming weeks I'll work this out as I experiment with new ways of holding the camera most comfortably. Overall, the camera body is sturdy and feels very well made.\n\nFeatures - Wide spread. I am coming from a Canon G9 which already has a pretty full feature set, but the ultimate manual controls on XSi just lets me feel much more connected to this camera. The Auto mode seems to work fine. I'm not experienced with any bigger or fancier DSLR's, so this mode seems fine to me - autofocus, flash and everything. Manual mode allows for the ultimate control of pretty much everything. I love taking nighttime, long exposure shots and the XSi allows for up to 30seconds of exposure or a BULB function. The results are great out of the box, though I'm sure with post processing some of the graininess that results can be cleared up.\n\nSpecs - The images are crystal clear with the kit lens compared to my G9. Even though they are both 12MP, the XSi at a 100% crop is so much clearer. I now don't worry about zooming in as far as I can - knowing I will be able to crop out a larger, closer image in the future if I want to. The built in flash is sufficient and has a pretty quick refresh time. I also have a Canon 220Ex which is a bit more powerful (not much though) but does have a much quicker refresh time. In burst mode on the XSi I can shoot twice as long and 1.5x as quick with the 220Ex which could really come in useful. I would invest in an external flash unit but for everyday shooting the built in one is fine. The autofocus is quick in my experience so far and is pretty accurate. It is much quciker than the G9, even in low light. Low light does slow it down a bit, but not bad at all.\n\nKit Lens (18-55) - As I have said this is my first DSLR so I don't have much knowledge of lenses, but this one is pretty GOOD, not great. The zoom is pretty basic - less than my G9 but wider angle to begin with, which I find more useful. I will eventually invest in a probably-Canon longer range zoom but for now, this is fine to be begin on. It is a quick lens and the Image Stabilizer seems to help (haven;t tried many moving situations yet) so I can't report completely on that. I do miss the focus distances on the manual focus ring (infinity to close, etc) so it is sometimes confusing to see what distance I am focusing at. Overall, a good lens and definitely worth the kit price if you are just starting out.\n\nBattery - The battery is great. I have taken almost 600 shots on the first full charge still, many of which have been flash, and the battery is only down one notch. Obviously this will go down with time, but it seems great.\n\nComplaints:\n1. Body size is good but takes some getting used to. not really a complaint, but just saying it will take a while to find a completely comfortable grip.\n2. Live view sucks. I love shooting through the eye piece, but in just using live view even for fun, it is bewildering and slow and bad. If you have a tripod it will be fine, but otherwise, do not buy this camera if you MUST have live view. I wanted the XSi because it did have live view, but I now realize I much prefer using the eyepiece. It is nice to know live view is there if I need it, but I cannot really see myself using it more than 1-2% of the time.\n3. Battery door almost impossible to open. I don't know why - it could just be mine but I'm thinking it is the way it is designed. I have to use a pencil tip or a butter knife in additon to my finger to slide it open and out.\n4. Lack of movie mode - I know, I know - its an SLR. But I have seen that Ashton Kutcher ad for Nikon with their HD movie mode, and I have to say that would be pretty cool to have on here. I have a feeling on the 500D or whatever the new Rebel is, Canon will install that. But I wish this one had it.\n\nOverall - Great beginners camera and even for a moderately experienced user. Only drawbacks are minor ones and for this price point, cannot really even be considered. I've wanted the Rebel since the 300D came out, and I now finally have one and I am in love."},{"reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great camera, zero effort at packing","reviewDate":"October 13, 2008","reviewText":"Marvelous feel to this body with the BG-E5 grip.

I finally made the jump from point and shoot to DSLR. Picture quality is way better in indoor or low light shots. I now realize how flash pictures are generally bad (and try to avoid if possible). I was unsure about the wide angle lens, so I bought an additional 50-250 lens. Well, I hardly ever take that out. The default lens is great and the wide angle setting is what I end up using most of the time. There are many automatic modes for newbies, but I like the straight forward aperture priority mode.\n\nIt certainly is bigger than a point and shoot but it is not very heavy. Finally, there are no autofocus problems as some reported. However, I don't use the default 9 point AF. The camera assumes the wrong area of focus in full auto mode and pictures may come out blurry. I use only the center AF point and make sure its where I want the focus to be. It focuses sharp and fast."},{"reviewerName":"kelsey Larsen","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"So cheap now!","reviewDate":"July 7, 2010","reviewText":"I bought my baby back when it was brand new $800 at Best Buy.

It is an EXCELLENT entry level camera for those moving away from point and shoot cameras. The lenses for it are inexpensive and it takes great photos. I can't say anything bad about this camera. If anything is bad it is that it uses EF-S lenses which you will eventually have to abandon once you get a full frame DSLR. I can't imagine after a few more years that all DSLRs won't be full frame and EF-S lenses will not be usable with those cameras.

They had the best price, amazingly fast shipping and they sent me an actual Canon lens with the camera. I took the big leap from a Fujifilm FinePix S700 (7.1 megapixels) to this new Canon EOS. My yearbook teacher allowed me to use the XTi for a little bit and I was amazed at the quality, rugedness, and the speed of the camera. I wanted to get something that I knew wouldn't be completly outdated once I get into college as I plan on being a photographer. This camera operates so much better in low-light situations than my last one that words can not even describe it. There is practicall no noise even at ISO settings as high as 1600. The software that was included is amazing, I can not get enough of the EOS utility. I might be doing a shoot for one of my teachers for christmas cards and I plan on bringing a laptop with me so that we can all see the pictures right away. I have rather large hands so a bigger camera was welcomed with wide-open arms. The IS on the lens is amazing, if switched off I could tell an imediate difference in the quality of the photograph. I was so excited to be able to have a camera with 'bulb' in its settings, this setting is extremely useful for astro-photography or very low-light situations, as it allows the shutter to stay open as long as the shutter button is held down. If you do not have a remot control yet, I wouldn't advise using it as any shake at all will be apparent in the resulting image, so use a speed like 30\", that should do what you need it to. F-Stops vary greatly which is always welcome in my back, my Fuji had F5.6-16.8 while this one has f5.6-38 in manual mode. The flash also rises high which helps a lot in distance as well as using the flash while taking macro pictures.

Viewfinder itself is good, however your eyebrows may hurt after 2-3 hours of continuous shooting. All in all, very happy with the camera.

Also sometimes in low light situations the camera's AF does focus on something other than the subject, but using manual focus fixes the problem. I just recently purchased a converter and attached a spotting scope to the camera, making the scope into a 1000-4000mm lens.

J. Markovitch","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Upgrading to XSi or 40d??? Went with XSi!!!","reviewDate":"August 7, 2008","reviewText":"I've been a long time photog. Back in the 80s I got into 35mm cameras with a Canon AE1 and A1. I then purchased a Rebel 35mm and used it for many years (still have it). A couple of years ago I purchased a digital Rebel XT which was soon uprgaded to an XTi. Both camera's were awesome and I never had a single problem with either of them. As most upgrades go though, each newer model provided new useful things which made the newer camera that-much better than the old one.\n\nI'm not going to write all the \"the camera does this and not that\" type things that everyone else has already written. You can go the Canon's website for all the specs. I am however going to say that I have purchased many things from Amazon over the years and never had a single problem. I decided to go to my local camera store for this purchase though; only because I wanted to handle the camera and play with it for a while before making a decsion.\n\nI was torn between upgrading to the XSi or 40d. I had heard many rumors that the 40d would soon be replaced with a newer, more advanced model. At time of this writing that has not happend yet. After handling both, and playing with them for several hours in my local shop (I think I drove the salesman nuts!) I have the following to say:\n\nThere is no doubt that the 40d is a bigger, more rugged appearing camera. It is however too big for me. It is not much heavier, but the grip and shape are bigger. The processer and guts for the most part are the same in both cameras and some of the features of the XSi are actually more advanced (since it is a newer model). The viewfinder in the XSi was clearer and sharper in the XSi and I just liked the overall feel better (may have something to do with being familier with the XTi). The overall sound of the camera functioning sounds great. Very professional. The 40d actually sounded too robotic to me when the shutter was used or the flash fired. The Live View feature on the XSi actually has one extra option that the 40d does not, which is great for me since I really enjoy macro photography. Most importantly, the camera is easy to use and very user friendly. The manual it comes with is pretty detailed, but I would still recommend buying a good aftermarket book on the XSi to really get to know it. I really couldn't see spending $400 more for the 40d. I'd prefer to put it towards a nice lens.\n\nUltimately, I decided to spend less money and get a great camera that will keep me happy for a couple years at which time I'm sure the next latest and greatest camera with already be on sale and I'll be ready for a new one! :)\n\nIf you are in the market for a camera that will do everything you want it to do, get the XSi. Whether you're an amature, pro or just a family member looking to take great photos of their kids and events, this camera will fit your needs. With the right lenses this camera will take magazine quality photographs. If you can't afford that, get the XTi, it also takes great photos. And if you have plenty of money to burn and just want a bigger camera, the 40d is no slouch."},{"reviewerName":"C.

We usually reserve the SLR that we are using for the more intense photo opportunities, and a good point-and-shoot for general travel usage, where its lighter weight and less cumbersome support equipment is a welcome respite for the shoulder muscles. But this XSi is really no heavier or larger than our latest Olympus point-and-shoot, so we may be rethinking our approach.\n\nThe XSi is a move up for us from one of the earliest Digital Rebel camera models that came out a few years ago, mostly so we could take advantage of a better-controlled internal flash unit and the new image-stabilization lenses. The old Rebel flash unit burned out every photo we ever tried with it. All our old Canon lenses work on the new camera as well, especially the 50 mm fixed lens that we use for family portrait shots.

Since this appears to be your first DSLR, let me offer you one tip on improving focus on your baby's face. Do NOT use \"autofocus\" (which is really nine point focus) for your portraits, or any other images for that matter. Instead set the MODE dial to the creative zone (NOT THE BASIC ZONE), using \"P\" will work well for you until you gain additional skills and confidence. Then press the focus button (see page 61 of your User's Manual) and move the MAIN dial until the only focus point selected is the center one. Next compose your shot by centering your baby's face in the center of the viewfinder, press the shutter half way, recompose if you want a different view (rule of thirds helps with composition) and shoot! Presto...your baby's face is now in sharp focus with all images! And when you're finally feeling that you've mastered the \"P\" setting, move on to learn shutter, aperature, and manual modes in the creative zone. Now you're a savvy photographer! Good luck!\n\nOne correction: The focus button I reference above (shown on page 61 in the User's Manual) is actually called the \"AF point selection\" button.

Once my baby turned about 7 months old, however, good shots became harder to come by since she moved so quickly and her expressions changed with a blink of an eye. I've always hated using flash, because it washes the photos out and you completely lose the background and natural tones. The Rebel XSi at ISO 1600 doesn't have noticeable grain, which allows me to capture more photos of her playing calmly or exploring a new object clearly without having to turn on the flash indoors. My baby is now 10 months old and stumbling around on two feet. Without upgrading my lens, I still have to turn on the flash to catch her 'on the move', but the flash on this SLR produces much better results than my point and shoot. I give the XSi 4 stars because it doesn't always pick out the correct focus plane (my baby's face) on autofocus -- which of course makes a big difference when your depth of field is more limited. I wouldn't get the XSi just for taking baby photos or if you plan to just use it in auto mode, as it has much more potential than that.

Because I find their prime lens to be much more affordable than Nikon, and customer reviews on the prime lens are outstanding. Even with the newly released Nikon D700, I decided to get the Canon XSI for a backup camera until Canon releases their new pro DSLR in the near future. The Canon XSI takes amazing pictures, is user friendly, and with the 2 prime lens that I already have; the results have been exceptional. I could not be happier.

The packaging is well thought out and the lens is pretty good for being all purpose.\n\nI really think this camera provided me with some excellent results so far and the settings are easy once you get used to how to access them.\n\nMy only beef with this product is that the selector wheel could be placed in a different location and that would make it easier which is the case with the nikon.

The price is one of the cheaper for what you are getting as a kit that Canon sells as separate pieces which if bought through them they would be about $100 more expensive. The photos are absolutely amazing and this is one heck of a jump up from my old point and shoot Canon Powershot A530. The strap for around your neck is really nice and easy to adjust depending on where you want it to sit. The software that comes with the camera is absolutely amazing and easy to download to your computer. The one thing that you need to get when you are first getting is a case for the camera. Other than that this is one amazing camera even in really low light. We had a haunted house we were putting on and we had a black light with people drawn on in highlighter and the pictures turned out amazingly for the fact that no other camera in our area could show the highlighter so vividly and without blur. The lowlight setting that you don't want a flash is what I set it to and the pictures are just about like if you were there."},{"reviewerName":"S.

My previous camera was a canon Point & Shoot (P&S) with which I felt limited although I was shooting times to times in manual mode.\nOne of the reasons that encouraged me to stay with canon was the good quality of my previous camera and because the canon cameras interface is quite similar (this saves time). The 450D/XSI is an excellent camera and the kit lens is very good and it can be complemented for a limited budget (less than 300$) with the good canon IS 55-250mm.\n\nI will not do a technical review as a lot of experts already did. [...] My advise or comment is for the people who are upgrading to a DSLR: you need to spend time to learn photography techniques and how your XSI/DSLR works. If you are buying this camera for just using the automatic mode it is not a wise investment (although the XSI automatic mode is excellent as well) and you can find cheaper and better alternatives (point &shoots, some other DSLR like the XT....\n\nIn addition I read in forums a lot of questions/remarks that would not have been raised if the people took 5 minutes to read the user guides or if they experimented by them self.\n\nAfter around 1000 shots with the XSI my photos improved significantly thanks as well to the use of the canon post processing software delivered with the camera.

The 3\" LCD monitor is amazing for viewing pictures and the size of the camera is perfect considering it goes everywhere with me.\n\nIf you are nervous about stepping into the world of Digital SLR camera's, don't be.

However there are a few things that bother me right now, on is that it's a slightly smaller size than I need with my hands anyway, I did read the specs just the feel of the camera is a a bit off compared to my previous canon film slr's and there is no surprise there. Another is that the digital noise has been somewhat bothersome on some of my night photography but no more than anticipated, noise doesn't have the same charm that film grain has though. Aside from a few minor complaints about size and noise of the camera, I'd like to be able to step down to 50 iso or even 25 maybe that could be done with a firmware update down the line. And I would have loved it to be full frame at this price but I can't complain I don't have enough money to buy a higher end camera. The lens is nice but nothing fantastic, IS works good for about 2 or maybe 3 stops which is swell. I've been using it heavily since late December and so far I feel confident in my decision to buy this camera. The colors are accurate and shooting in RAW helps to maintain great detail in the image. All in all its a nice camera for an introduction to digital nothing spectacular but its doing well enough for me.\n\nOn a side note I've been playing a lot with mounting other brand lenses on this camera coming up with somewhat of a lomo feel to the digital world without messing around with photoshop. So far I've used a holga, and diana lens and been able to produce some lets call them interesting images, still working on the best way to mount them but I'll try to post some images once I get it worked out.\n\nI hope the review helps and that I didn't babble on too much, its a nice camera but you get what you pay for don't expect the best but you can make great images from it still."},{"reviewerName":"Massoud Vaziri","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"It's a good camera for the price.","reviewDate":"November 10, 2008","reviewText":"Mine came with two lenses, an 18-55mm and a 55-250mm IS lens.

Brett","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Photography Addiction!!!!","reviewDate":"March 18, 2010","reviewText":"Since I was a child I always had a camera and loved taking pictures. My first camera was a Kodak 35mm rectangle job. You know the one with the square one time use flash on top? I then had Vivitars and Ritchshot In May of 2000 I bought the Canon Rebel EOS for trips to China and Australia. I never fully got proper use of the camera because film does not show the errors of your settings. I then went on to buy several Nikon Cool Pix and a Canon Powershot S2. In December of 2009 my wife and I bought each other as a gift to ourselves this camera. Words do not describe the feeling of \"arriving\" as an artisitc photographer. Ous lives will never be the same.\n\nI must say I am biast against Nikon SLR's because my friends have them, and with the graduation to lenses and accessories I will be Canon 4 life.\n\nThe functions of this camera are amazing. Eveything I struggled with for years in film, and inept point and shoot and powershot cameras came to an abrupt end by purchasing this one. The functions people struggle with, tones, lighting, sharpness are answered in a matter of a few test shots going through normal photography education (a quick reference guide in the owners manaual gives a brief overview that you can learn what you need to know). The book was a guide that in the 1st week and several hundred shots later were answered by photographs that made friends and family think they were fake or not done by this camera. I will be posting photos here on 3/19/10 of what I am trying to convey. The use of the picture style defines the photos that you take. Monochrome, Sepia, landscape with the right filters brings out the inner photographer you never knew you had. You will never, ever go back to the automatic settings after two weeks of using P, TV, AV, M, and A-Dep setting. The 12.1 Megapixles is great for framing the highest quality photos in 11x14 frames. I do not belive in the near future our walls we be able to hold our photos, we will have to keep switching them out.\n\nThe only warning I have for buyers of this camera, or any SLR is that these are the cameras that take you to a new comfortable level and that comes with a price!!! you start off with the 18-55mm lense. That is not good enough. You must then get filters to bring out the landscapes and protraits you are taking. Then you move on to buying the 70-200mm or 70-300mm lenses, because you need the advance lenses to take action photos, or landscape photos. Then you need a wide angle lense, because taking pictures in the mountains or indoors, or of landscapes you get tired of backing up and not getting what you want in the shot. Then comes the hood for the wide angle, and the UV filter, and it goes on and on. Think of the camera as a foundation to advanced photography, however the lenses, the flash, and the filters, which will run you $700-$2000 it is what defines the pictures themselves. This camera is an awesome tool to capture your view of the world, the events in your life, and convey them in a professional manner. The price is fair and it will be a camera for years and years of professional photography."},{"reviewerName":"liza","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Simple?","reviewDate":"June 24, 2010","reviewText":"I have been using this camera for a few months.\nFirst of all, I'm not a professional. I am a hobby photographer and I enjoy photography really much.\n\nThis is my second DSLR. My first one was an olympus E-410 (which I really don't like), and GOD I love you for this thing.\nThe first time I held the camera in my hands it felt like it was made for me. I have small hands and this thing is so adorable. It's light (no pressure on the neck/shoulders), easy to use, FAST to use (when changing setting and stuff) and its a steal for the price.\n12.2 megapixel is alot, and probably more than I'll ever need. But I got this thing to 'grow' with. I want to get better and better everyday I press the shutter.

Right?\nI don't see any difference between the camera's.\nSame body, same feel, just the video-thing what makes them different. If I didn't have an iPod with a video recording setting, I would have gone for the later version(s). But hey that me, and I only bought this dslr for photography. Not for video.\nBut, If you're interested in buying a 1000D and can't decide, I suggest not to pic the 1000D (I don't know what the american name is, rebel xs or something?)\nIt feels so plastic, so 'novice'-like. If you want a camera that isn't a beginner model and you have a budget, this is definitely your choice.\n\nI bought this dslr with a 50mm f/1.4 lens. And maybe if you have done your homework and researched a bit, you know this lens knock's out all the others. Its cheap for its price, and a perfect match with a 450D.\nReally lightweight, superior image quality. The colors and DoF are...

The 12 megapixel camera goes great with the (decent) starter lens, and it seems to have just about the right amount of features to create those professionally looking pictures.\n\nI was a bit worried about the autofocus problem that some people have reported, but, as I see it, it was just that those people used all of the focus points when shooting, which could cause the camera to focus on something different from the desired target. If you are experiencing any problems, I recommend shifting to center point focus and see if that helps.\n\nPersonally, when purchasing, I was a bit stuck in between this camera and Rebel T1i. I chose this camera, first of all, because it was cheaper, and as money was a bit short, I was also attracted by the lower megapixel count (so I wouldn't require a better lens immediately). I thought the Rebel T1i's HD video function was pretty cool, until I looked into it. Turns out that its \"full HD\" function is only at 20 fps (which is not desirable). Also, it is only possible to record sound in mono and you cannot attach an external microphone.\n\nIn conclusion: I recommend this camera to anyone who is just starting out with photography, as this will stay with you for a long time. If you really need to be able to record HD video, I recommend buying a cheap HD camera and use that instead, as the quality and sound will probably be better than that of the Rebel T1i."},{"reviewerName":"Larry S.

The camera takes great photos even with the kit lens. I bought the EF 28-135mm just for a better range and USM focusing. The camera is very easy to get used to. The buttons are laid out well. The XSI is much lighter than higher end DSLRs (7D) and the portability is great. With the kit lens attached, you barely notice your carrying it. (the 28-135 adds significant weight) The only feature I wish it had is a higher ISO, although the pictures at ISO 1600 are pretty good with the noise reduction on. I would definitely recommend this camera to anyone looking for an entry level DSLR or even a back-up camera. Great value for the money."},{"reviewerName":"Taylor K.

If you are wanting a camera that take great photos and is easy to use, this is it. Take a day to read through your entire manual. If you are thinking about getting into the photography business, this is a great camera to learn on and in time upgrade to something a little better.\nIt, like all other canon cameras are interchangeable with all the canon lenses.

I'm sold to the XSi mainly because of the new Spot metering and 3\" screen!! Live View is a plus but I only used it a couple of times.\nPeople always compare the XSi to the 40D. Price w/ feature wise their prices are pretty much the same, but the main reason that I chose the XSi was the SMALL SIZE. For people with small hands like me the 40D is too wide and heavy. On the 40D I couldn't reach some of the inner buttons without taken my hand away from the grip.\nThe IS kit lens is an excellent start but the camera quickly out grown its resolution.

I love the larger screen on this camera - a definite step up from my Rebel XT. The flash really leaves something to be desired, especially when it fires several times prior to taking a picture in low-light. My camera had the dreaded \"BUSY\" reading that many people have complained about. It is currently on it's way back from Canon's repair facility and I'm hoping they found a solution to the problem.

I had to put it back in the car for several minutes until it began to operate again. Finally, after over an hour of annoying, unannounced shutdowns it started doing what it's supposed to. The pictures it takes are nothing short of spectacular. I love the design and the interface. Overall a great camera. I'm afraid, however I will have to stick with my erstwhile Canon S2is.

The Rebel XSi is a great camera to transition into the DSLR world.\n\nThe EF-S 18-55mm F/3.5 IS Lens is a good lens to take average photos. The images are decent enough to get by but if you buy an additional lens with upgraded glass the sensor truly shines. It is a APS-C size sensor which is the same sensor used in the Canon EOS 60D that recently hit the market. If you find that you like the DSLR world and want to upgrade to a better body then the additional lenses that you purchased for the Rebel XSi sensor will work on the Canon 60D sensor so you will save money there. You will also have a good second body to carry with you on shoots and what not.\n\nI have owned this camera for two years now and I am happy with my decision.

Individually they are both incredible components. The camera has most of the features of more expensive dSLRs and the lens is an \"L\" lens, possessing incredible optics and quality. But I'm not sure they work well together.\n\nWhen I first lifted the camera from the shipping box I was impressed. The camera felt solid, not like some cheap plastic cameras on the market. And it was relatively light-weight.\n\nThe lens was built like a tank, solid, bulky at 77mm diameter, and quite heavy. But when the lens was attached to the camera something strange happened. It didn't feel right. The balance was way off. Since the lens was 50% heavier than the camera, it tended to point downward, like a divining rod, when the camera was suspended by its' strap. But, of course, \"heavy\" is a relative term. I had just upgraded from a compact P&S. And most quality dSLR lenses tend to be \"heavy\". I read about photograpers who label camera and lenses even heavier than mine as \"light\". This is just a personal reaction I want to convey. I had anticipated I would be supporting the weight of the camera almost totally with my right hand, using my left had only for balance. But I find I am also using my left hand to support considerable weight.\n\nI won't go here into much detail about the specifications. They'll be discussed in depth by other reviewers. Suffice it to say this is a quality camera with advanced features and \"predictable\" controls.\n\nThere is one operational issue I think should be addressed, however. It's almost impossible to frame a shot using the viewfinder without smudging that beautiful 3\" LCD monitor with your nose. There are eyepiece extenders available, but most users are not satisfied with them. It is said much of the image is blocked with their use.\n\nI have addressed this problem by installing a plastic protector over the LCD monitor. I suggest you do the same. Now I can rub the protector to my heart's content without fear of scratching the LCD glass.\n\nOne other thing: Protect your lens with a quality UV filter. it would be pointless to install a cheap UV filter over a high-quality lens. I went for the B&H.\n\nIn summary, although I'm not yet comfortable with my combination of camera and lens, I did not let this detract from my grade. After all, this is a review of\na camera, and not of a lens or even a combination of the two. Hopefully my discomfort will pass as I use the camera more frequently."},{"reviewerName":"Rudra","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Review of Xsi Canon","reviewDate":"October 24, 2009","reviewText":"This is the first camera I've ever owned - including point and shoot cameras...yes, i popped my cherry with a canon Xsi.\n\nThis camera has me wishing that I could relive some moments of my life just to be able to capture them with the Xsi.

It is very simple to open up and start taking pictures with. It has basic modes that figure out the settings for you, and then creative modes where you can modify the different variables to your liking once you learn how to use the camera that way. I recommend reading David Busch's book on this specific camera before using it. It really helps you learn how to use the camera, and it also serves as a great manual. This is a sweet camera, and if you are not a professional photographer then I think this kit will have everything you need to take your picture taking to the next level."},{"reviewerName":"David S","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Amazing camera, price, and results!!!","reviewDate":"October 14, 2008","reviewText":"I have had this camera for 5 months, since April 2008. At first my results were inferior to those of my Rebel 300D images. I just assumed the camera would just produce better images! well it does, but you need to unlock its potential.\n\nThe Canon XSi is a fantastic SLR for entry level digital SLR beginners/amateurs. It allows your to have a light weight camera, that still can stand up to some abuse.\n\nIt is possible to take over 1,000 images on a single battery charge. The XSI has a peppy 3.5 FPS shooting speed so you can capture sport images at your local high school with ease and pride.\n\nWhen switching from a compact point and shoot to an SLR, there is a learning curve. As long as purchasers realize they are not acquiring a more advanced point and shoot, they will on a better path to great photos.\n\nAs I said, there is a learning curve. You need to learn about aperture, shutter speed, ISO, and how those combine to create an exposure and scene. Furthermore, there are some nice customizations available by the XSi such as focus and exposure lock separation, spot metering for accurate exposure control, live view focusing (2 modes).\n\nSLR photography is a fun and exciting challenge. If you buy this camera, do not just use the auto mode!!!\n\nI have created a free resource at [...] to provide for free tutorials on maximizing your 450d/XSi experience."},{"reviewerName":"Davin Coleman","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Canon XSI","reviewDate":"April 16, 2009","reviewText":"I am new to DSLRs cameras. I like the canon XSI, it has outperformed any digital camera I have had in the past. However, I would think the Canon XS is just as good for a beginning photographer, with a smaller price tag. The Canon XSI does have more features but may not warrant the increase in price over the XS. Now if your one of those people, (like me) that want all the features, go with the XSI. You will be happy you bought it.\n\nPros: Speed\nQuality photos\nCreative mode\n\nCons: Had to buy the opteka battery grip to improve the canmeras grip.

I also bought the 55-250mm SI (image stabilized) zoom lens instead of the popular 55-300mm unstabilized zoom lens. I use this lens as my default lens, with the kit lens mainly used for wide angle and scenes. I love the image stabilization feature as this allows me to take handheld telephoto sports and nature shots. I don't care for the APX format sensor, though, with its 3:2 aspect ratio.

With the expert reviews I have read about the other amateur level cameras in the market, this seems to be the best one. The manual modes take a bit of understanding before you want to operate the camera in those modes. But automatic modes are also quite good. The sensor and the lens both are very good. IS works superbly. Very user friendly.\n\nThe only disadvantage is that is comes with no in-built memory.\nAlso in some of the modes when the sensor senses less light it prompts automatic pop-up of the flash. A few times I tried to put my hand on the flash to prevent the pop-up. In those case the display monitor shows some kind of error and blacks out. I had to turn it off and turn it back again.\nBut then there is an automatic mode which does not use the flash.\n\nIf you are planning to spend the money I would recommend to spend it the best way- buy the XSI. It is worth it."},{"reviewerName":"Dale H. Hall","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Canon Rebel Xsi a camera for the serious enthusiast who knows how to shoot","reviewDate":"November 10, 2009","reviewText":"I have owned the Canon Rebel Xsi now for almost two and half years. This has been by far one of the best camera's I have ever owned. This review is for those who are serious about shooting and will use the camera on a near-daily basis.\n\nI got started in photography by taking a required art class in college at the University of Mobile. Since I cannot draw, paint, or sculpt , the logical choice for me was photography. While taking the photography 101 class I used my room mates Canon film camera that is over thirty years old. Oh, and I got an \"A+\" in the class. Yeah who cares right, yes I know I am just saying.\n\nWhile shopping for my next serious camera I decided to go with Canon for several reason's. There are more professional photographer's who use CANON camera's than any other brand combined. I was first trained and taught on a CANON film camera. CANON offer's more lens to choose from than any other brand. You can use any kind of CANON lens you so desire. The best part is that the sensor buried deep inside of the camera is NOT a full-frame sensor. Unless you are a photographer shooting for an ad agency that puts up billboard signs you will most likely never need a full-frame sensor. It gets even better. Because the Xsi is not a full-frame sensor you are getting a .6 of a zoom in. This means that you are getting at least an extra half times zoom free just for buying a 1.6 size sensor!\n\nInitially, I bought the Xsi because of the price and features offered. I am not going go into every feature, just what was and still is important to me. I really liked the huge 3 inch display on the back of the camera. The display in terms of color quality really is just that good. I initially bought the camera so I could see my settings on manual on the display screen. However I have recently been shooting so many concerts and events that happen at night that it is easier to just look through the viewfinder.\n\nI have small fingers and I like how all of the buttons are on the right side of the body on the back of the camera. Keep in mind the back of the camera is where you will see most if not all of your buttons and functions. All of the buttons are easy to find in the dark and become second-nature should you invest the time to find the appropriate button and learn how to adjust settings on-the-fly. Ideally as a photographer you should be able to adjust all of your settings in the dark (school plays, concerts, firework displays)\n\nMost of the professional series camera's have CF cards that hold all of the shots on the camera. I really like how the Xsi uses SD cards. I have found unless you are shooting high-speed photography (airshow, sports, etc.) a class 2 (known as classII) SD cards will always get the job done. However, if you shoot weddings, basketball games, soccer, hockey, concerts, airshows, etc.; you will most likely want to spring a little extra money for the Class III SD cards. Is it worth the money? In a word if you shoot all the time, yes by all means. I have taken my SD cards swimming in the ocean by accident and even forgot to remove said SD card from my shorts before drying a load of clothes! SD cards can take a beating and still perform flawlessly.\n\nI have really become enamored with the menu button switch on the back of the camera. With this button I can select the file quality, AEB, Flash exposure, picture style, format cards, custom settings, etc.\n\nThe AEB stands for Automatic Exposure Bracketing. If you are in love with HDR photography , you can hit the AEB button, tell the camera how far apart you would like to set the exposure(s), and press the shutter once for 3 different shots taken without having to do any of the work. In other words, you press the shutter and 3 different shots are taken for you.\n\nIf you are still reading my review the file quality is there in case you need it. Serious photographers shoot in RAW and use Lightroom or photoshop to convert the images over to JPEG for saving to a PC and printing at a lab. The advantage with RAW is that RAW gives you way more control over the shot you took. In other words, let's say you took a shot and the flash did not go off. You can used RAW to pull more information about that image to bring out the natural lighting and color all in this same shot!\n\nWhat's nice about this feature is if you need to dump tons of photo's onto someone's PC you do not need to convert the files!\n\nWhite Balance is your ability to set the true color in any environment. Very few churches look the same on the inside. Likewise there are places that have crazy color's. An example are children's rooms, rooms that are completely covered with wood paneling, places where it is very dark, brightly colored rooms in orange, pink, purple and of course red. With white balance I can use a sheet of typing paper, or a white balance card. All I have to do is press the \"WB\" button take my white balance photo and we are done.\n\nP stands for program. So, you do not want to shoot in auto because auto is for idiots right? Use P for professional.\n\nTv stands for time value. If you are shooting with a flash indoors at a wedding birthday party, etc use Tv at a setting of 1/125 of a second. If you are shooting in very low light you would use 1/13th of a second.\n\nAperture Priority is for the experts. No need to explain.\n\nM for manual use for concert studio photography. This is also for those who are hard-core shooters.\n\nThe Xsi can be remotely fired with a remote for group shots (with yourself in it). The remote is $30 and is not a bad investment. You can use a small 5-6 foot cord to prevent shutter shake if your camera is placed on a tripod. The Xsi also has a several settings for a timer with a flashing light on the front to indicate time left before flash goes off. The mount for a tripod on this camera is just outstanding I have never had any issues with it.\n\nISO button can be slightly hard to reach but, I have found you will never need to see where it is located. It will almost always be bright enough for you to see. The ISO button has saved my behind so many times it is not even funny. ISO button is always of great importance when selecting a camera.\n\nOK have you ever noticed how some of the pop-up flash(es) out there are really weak? Well with the Xsi you can dial up or down just how much power (light) the pop-up flash puts out. If you are shooting a wedding or some other high-profile event, the external flash can be controlled through your lens and your camera. This feature is called E-TTL II. It stands for electronic Through The Lens Light meter! Your sensor tells the flash when to go off how bright, flash duration, etc. In fact you can simply use the flash and forget that it's there; it simply works automatically. I have found with CANON flash systems however I like to set my flash exposure at 1 F stop greater than zero.\n\nNow for the review of the 18-55mm AF IS lens. People who tells me this lens is a piece of garbage have no clue as to what garbage is. I am not sure what the fascination with zoom lens is. If I am shooting a ballet or a wedding I can expect a minimum of 4 or 5 people to ask me how well a 70-200mm lens works.\n\nGetting back to the 18-55mm lens this is the lens to use for architecture, night scenes, fireworks, family photo's, landscape, vacations, etc. Just because there is very little zoom does not mean this lens sucks. It is great for which it is intended. If you wish to have greater zoom simply buy a lens that has greater zoom built in. A 17-85 IS AF lens is a great example and it is relatively cheaper than say a 24-105mm lens.\n\nIn a word will buying this camera make you a better photographer no! No camera out there can do that for you! Is this a great entry level camera to use? Heck Yeah! I did not mention the Live View function for good reason, it sucks. Live view is a useless feature that is useless on nearly every camera out there. While your friends are setting up their shots with their fancy 'lil purse pocket camera's you are long done with the shot.\n\nThe only thing I do not like about this camera is the body is made of plastic.\n\nIf you would like to see high-quality shots please visit my flickr site at\n[...]\n\nBelieve it or not the rules of photography have not changed, they have become even more important than ever before."},{"reviewerName":"M.

Overall, it's a solid camera. Color reproduction is wonderful, it's quick, low noise with high iso, and terrific macros. The camera is blazing fast. Please refer to the other posters for the good points of this camera.\n\nNow i'll discuss the shortcomings. The major one, which has been referenced to in various forums such as dpreview and a few online review sites is poor AutoFocus. Not all cameras are affected, but mine was. If you shoot at an object from w/in 10 ft, it has trouble over 50% of the time picking up the autofocus point and often selects the wrong point. If you use center focus, it gets pretty close but final image is still a bit blurry. It becomes a bit sharper w/ the live view autofocus system. When I took some outdoor pics of some animals, i couldn't quite lock on what i was interested in. Even when taking shots of people outside w/ a prominent background, it seems to have trouble deciding if it wants to focus on the person or the background. I'd say that 20% of my shots were actually in focus and those look wonderful. The remaining ones had the focus off. So i'm gonna send my camera to canon for repair. I went to best buy and tried out a 40D and the focus was rock solid.

My situation started in January of 09 when I bought the XSI along with the 50mm f1.8 and the 55-250mm IS lens after reading extensive reviews on the internet before I purchased the camera. After receiving the camera and lenses I started to see a focus issue very quickly with the kit lens. I then contacted Amazon and they promptly sent me a new XSI camera. When I received that camera I used both kit lenses on both bodies and they both had the very same AF issue when you use the center focus point. When I used the 50 prime and the 55-250mm IS with both camera bodies neither of those lenses missed the focus using the center focus point. I never was in auto mode always in shutter or aperture mode. Every picture with the kit lens was clearly very soft and out of focus. I then returned the first camera back to Amazon for credit and I sent the second kit lens to Canon for recalibration. When I received it back from Canon I then started the process again and there was some improvement but they were all out of focus using the center focus point or any one of the 9 individual focus points. I then started to experiment with the camera by using aperture priority and center auto focus point and I would use the AF shutter button pressed half way and then switch to live view and the image would be out of focus so I would refocus in live view and it would nail the scene every time due to the fact they use different focus methods in live view. This is unacceptable. Furthermore when I contacted Canon CS they portrayed that I was the only person that has had an issue with the XSI and the kit lens. Even after I got the lens back and contacted Canon CS I got the same response about me being the only person with this issue. I still thought it was my technique but I can tell you that after 3000 pictures with the camera I cannot be that BAD there is an inherent problem with the communication between the kit lens and the body of the XSI period! Canon can say what they want but after taking the camera to 2 different professionals we all came to the same conclusion. I know the kit lens is NOT L quality but the kit lens should perform to the same standard as the 55-250mm IS lens and if not then back to the research for a different camera and that is when I am after 2 months of frustration with the camera. The lack of Canon recognizing the true issue and being able to fix it really has me stumped. I could have sent the body and the lens back to Canon at no charge because they sent me a return label but my time with Amazon return policy was up so I had no other choice but to return the 2nd camera that I tried to like. If you would like to see the pictures I would gladly send them to you. You can contact me through this site I think?\nLpowers"},{"reviewerName":"Claudia J.

This is my first SLR so I thought the focus problem was user error; that I just didn't know how to use it. I've used manual focus on a tripod with a 2 sec delay to make sure the issues wasn't shake. Now I see other's with the same problem so I believe it's a camera problem. I'm going to send it in for repair, so hopefully they have a fix for the problem. It's pretty sad when my little point and shoot has superior photo quality.\n\nOn the positive side, I love the ergonomics of the camera. It's easy to use and the battery life is awesome. Over a 2 day trip and 300 photos, the battery held up great.\n\nI actually love the camera except for the focus issue which when resolved will improve the rating significantly."},{"reviewerName":"M.

However, I installed the software with the discs provided,excitedly connected the camera to my computer to download and found that the software did not include a required .dll file. I have to say I was pretty proud of mysself that I went online, found the file on a free download site and got it all going. BUT WHY DID I HAVE TO DO THIS??? Also, I wish the website had a way to inform a buyer off additional items I would need to operate the camera.

I can take the exact same picture, on a tripod, without moving the camera or changing the focus and one image will be blurry while the other will come out fine. The camera also does not consistently download pictures onto our computer or any other. It had to be serviced once already about 2 weeks after getting it for this problem. We tried a couple of different computers with tech support walking us through. What a disappointment and a waste of money."},{"reviewerName":"M. khoee","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"good midlevel digital camera","reviewDate":"September 5, 2008","reviewText":"much better than the model it has replaced.2nd curtain flash is an advanced feature.live view can't be beat."},{"reviewerName":"Adam","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Satisfied","reviewDate":"November 29, 2008","reviewText":"This is our first DSLR.

This is my first SLR camera. It impresses me with its rapid focus adjustment and low-noise performance even at area without enough lights. However, the reason I don't give it 5 stars is I found there are three fixed position noise points on the sensor chip of this camera. Fortunately, it is unnoticeable unless I print out the pictures in large size. So this doesn't matter very much for ordinary use. I love this camera."},{"reviewerName":"Pupillo Sebastiano","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"almost perfect","reviewDate":"August 17, 2008","reviewText":"a very short review because I don't speak english: this camera is almost perfect for a non professional user (like me) and deserves a better lens, you have to buy separately of course. the only strange behavior I have encountered is that sometimes it needs a \"reboot\", but speaking of an electronic device it's not surprising at all; also, it's impossible to change all the parameters in full manual operation with your eye on the viewfinder."},{"reviewerName":"Patrick K.","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great camera","reviewDate":"January 12, 2009","reviewText":"The camera is very versatile and easy to use, however has many complex features depending on your skills.

This camera turned out to be terrible in numerous apspects. Auto-focus is next to useless. Nothing seemed to be in focus, even pics taken with our old Powershot 610 were better indoors and out. Flash is worse then a candle for typical lite rooms. Expect to have to buy an add on flash with any of these DLSR the image processors just dont work with adundant light just like camcorders. Pictures were either under or overexposed and sometimes the flash wouldnt even go off. The camera grip is aweful and you constantly either cover the red eye reducer or the flash with your hand while trying to hold it. Even my wife who has small hands had a hard time holding it. The auto-focus issue seems to be a recurring issue with the this camera for months now after reading reviews.

I own XSi for 3 months, I agree it's a fine camera for many scene, but it failed at some senarios. There are too many praise for the XSi, I'll focus on a couple of things that are failed and Canon can improve these features for next model.\n\n1. The full auto mode always over expose when background is bright and flash is on. I shoot picture with Mt. Rainer at background in sunny day, but no picture expose correctly, piture is too bright to show mountain.\n\n2. The auto mode also over expose when background is dark. I shoot picture of water birds in Lake Washington. The color of water is dark, all duck, goose are over exposed badly.\n\n3. XSi exposure evaluation function can't adjust shutter speed according to lens type. When I use EF-S lens, XSi shall lower the shutter speed warning limit. When I use a non-IS EF lens, XSi shall raise the shutter speed warning limit accordingly, so I can adjust with a higher speed above 1/125 to shoot a clear picture without IS. It's easy to add the small but extremely useful function.\n\n4. Continuous shotting such as AEB Auto Exposure Bracketing and sport mode, the reflection mirror flipps for each shot in order to let the sensor recored the picture. Mirror flip action limits the number of pictures/frames XSi can take in high speed. In continuouse shooting, the sensor itself shall able to record the picture based on shutter speed continuousely without flipping the mirror. It's not a film camera that need roll film for each shot. Sampling of image signal is electronically, 100 samples can be taken in a second easily many years ago.\n\n5. Not a full frame view finder and sensor. The view finder is very narrow and small, can match with the lens's angle. It wastes the ability of any lens because only 2/3 of the view is taken into the picture. My EOS-5(35mm) works much better on view finder, very comfortable and clear.\n\nI shoot many good pictures with XSi, with above enhanced features it will make me easier to take great pictures."},{"reviewerName":"debra-do","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"amazing camera","reviewDate":"September 7, 2008","reviewText":"love love love this camera-response is fast, design is user friendly with dedicated hard buttons for the controls you change the most, and the menus are easy to navigate."},{"reviewerName":"Vicky Batten","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Without a doubt, the best camera out there","reviewDate":"March 12, 2010","reviewText":"You dont have to spend any more than this to get a top knoch camera.

Shuler","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"The next/best thing from Canon","reviewDate":"May 3, 2008","reviewText":"We'll start with what this camera is NOT:\n\n1) It's NOT a full-frame camera. That means it's smaller, lighter, and the resulting 1.6x crop factor is important to remember if you have EF lenses already. But because it's smaller it offers less features making it easier to use at the expense of being slightly less functional. These are, for the most part, obscure features nobody will ever use anyway. Also, because it doesn't have features like 6.5 fps, a pentaprism, and Flash Exposure Bracketing, it is less expensive than the x0D series.\n\n2) The XSi is NOT a point-and-shoot digicam. Don't expect it to do videos, sound, or to incorporate all kinds of convenient uber-automation. While 'cool', this automation usually just keeps you from controlling what you want to do yourself. Most of the time, this camera will stay in \"P\" or \"program mode\" for me. There is a green setting for point-and-shoot operation, but all this does is disable most of the features that you buy the camera for.\n\n2a) Live View is NOT the same as the LCD viewfinder on point-and-shoot digicams. Don't expect it to focus fast or provide the same functionality. Live View is intended for a camera mounted on a tripod or held steady. It is a GREAT way to get perfect focus when you need it. You just zoom in to 10x magnification and manually focus or let the contrast detection do it for you. But, it is NOT an LCD viewfinder. As long as you don't think it will be (I was stupid enough to think that way) then you know before you buy.\n\nThe bad: (in all fairness, these are true of most modern DSLR's)\n\n1) The battery is improved, yes, but it's REALLY expensive. I bought a generic battery for a backup. Keeping the Canon battery fully charged, of course, and only using the generic when the Canon is charging.\n\n2) The LCD screen is right where my nose and cheek go. You can't avoid getting the glass all dirty and that gets annoying. And if the S5 can have an articulated 2.5\" screen, why can't the XSi?\n\n3) A cheesy rubber cover. I like that all of the inputs are on the side, but I just hate these cheesy rubber covers. I would prefer a sliding cover or, better yet, use the space next to the SD slot.\n\n4) Battery door on the bottom. On my tripod, I can't access the battery without removing the camera from the tripod. This was also an issue with my first two digital Rebels.\n\nNow, we'll do a reality check:\n\n1) To those who say, \"It's only 12mp,\" they're right. But, understand that unless you're printing bigger than 8x10\", this resolution is better than adequate. In fact, the majority of the lenses out there don't have sufficient resolution to go above 12 megapixels. What I mean is that you can have a 100 megapixel camera but your lens is only really pushing out 10mp worth of quality resolution, what's the point? Many point-and-shoots have too much resolution for their lenses. Just try blowing up a typical 10mp p-&-s image to 8x10 and see what you get. Chances are, the 8mp sensor from the Digital Rebel XT did better.\n\n2) Some will say \"It feels flimsy.\" I completely disagree. It feels solid and durable to me. Now, if you don't know this already, the plastic is actually a covering and environmental seal. Underneath, there is a stainless steel frame that holds everything solid. Your strap attaches to the frame directly as does the lens mount, tripod mount, and sensor. The plastic isn't structural so however it might FEEL to you, the camera is, in reality, stronger than you might think. Now, I can understand if you're used to tough magnesium shells that you might be prejudiced against the plastic, however this camera costs hundreds less. One cannot justify criticizing the Rebel series if they aren't willing to pay the extra for the x0D series.\n\n3) Critics say that APS-C is going to be obsolete. That's absurd! Remember that there are now scores of APS-C lenses from Canon, Nikon, Pentax, Sony, Sigma, Tamron, and Tokina and those numbers continue to grow. Further, APS-C cameras are selling like hotcakes without any sign of slowing down. These people are the same ones that kept their Reel-to-Reel players because they were higher quality. Higher quality, yes, but you can't say that CD's aren't going to sell well because reel-to-reel is higher quality. APS-C is becoming the DSLR equivalent of what 35mm film was. Meanwhile, so-called \"full-frame\" sensor cameras are going the way of older 6x7 and 645 film cameras. They are limited to professionals and high-end enthusiasts. Why? Film was limited and topped out at resolution long ago. To get higher resolution, you needed bigger film. Not true with digital sensors. APS-C has not maxed out on resolution yet. Smaller sensors haven't even hit their stride. There is no reason sensors cannot hit 20-30 megapixels in an APS-C in the near future, but why? The lenses are still the limiting factor. In fact, it might be true soon that SMALLER will be better. As sensors get better, they can get smaller. It's cheaper to make a four-thirds or APS-C than a full-frame of the same quality level.\n\nHere's where I get to play designer... what does the XSi need?\n\n1) Articulating LCD. Like I said earlier, if Canon can add the articulating 2.5\" screen to their S5 camera for $350 total, why in the world can't they put it on their best-selling DSLR?\n\n2) Sliding door for the inputs. Cheesy rubber covers are not as cool as designers think they are. Why can't Canon just put one environmentally sealed door for the battery, SD card, and all the inputs? And, hey, why not put it on the side so you can access it while the camera is on the tripod?\n\n3) Why all the inputs? Just have one USB slot to connect to the computer, to the TV, and use the same USB port for a DC input?\n\n4) One dial? Why not two? The Pentax K20D allows you instant access to the aperature with one dial, shutter with the other. Cool.\n\n5) Where did FEB go? Flash Exposure Bracketing? They had it on the XTi. Why did they take it away from me?"},{"reviewerName":"Andres Muoz","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Perfect camera","reviewDate":"February 14, 2009","reviewText":"All its features are great.

My first SLR was the AE-1 Program and was a wonderful camera for years. My last few cameras have been point and shoot digitals with some ability to manually control things like shutter speed, white balance and the like.\n\nI bought the Canon Rebel Xsi a little over a month ago and have consistently had problems with the auto focus. I called Canon tech support and after much discussion and evaluation of my test shots they asked me to send them the camera and lens for evaluation. They were both returned about 10 days later with the note that the lens needed some adjustment but all was now within factory specifications. More test shots showed the same blurry images when zoomed to 100%. By comparison, my point-and-shoot digital produces sharp images at 100%, as a much more expensive DSLR certainly should.\n\nThe bottom line is that repeated calls to Canon Tech support have yielded nothing but blaming me for not understanding how DSLRs work or understanding the \"softer focus\" of DSLRs compared to P&S cameras. I have seen other complaints on blogs about the bad focus of this camera - unfortunately after my purchase. I don't know why Canon does not stand behind this camera but their attitude is \"you bought it, get used to it.\"\n\nIf a camera cannot accurately focus, what good are all the rest of its abilities? As far as manual focus (one of their suggestions to avoid the auto focus problem), there is no built-in help for manual focus as there was in the old film SLRs. After all, you're supposed to be able to rely on the elaborate auto focus system to do its job. Nothing they have suggested, and I have tried mightily, has fixed this basic problem. I'm now planning to sell this camera online since my return window (30 days) passed while I spent too many hours trying to get Canon to take some responsibility for this problem. Maybe someone else will be happy with this camera if they never want to see their photos at 100% of the image size or never expect to crop them.\n\nShame on Canon for this defective camera and not standing behind it by replacing it. They apparently care little about customer satisfaction at least with this model."},{"reviewerName":"F.

Not wanting to break my bank account I had been eyeing up the latest consumer level SLR from Canon, the Rebel XSi, and eagerly awaiting its release date.\n\nCompared to other SLRs in this class the Canon Rebel XSi includes the following:\n\n- 12.2 Megapixels: They just keep going up! This alone gives the Rebel XSi an advantage because (at this point in time) there is no other consumer level SLR camera with more megapixels on the market. I've even had a few friends tell me they're looking to upgrade from last years Rebel XTi which had 10.1.\n\n- 3.0\" LCD Panel:. Just when you thought they couldn't make it any bigger Canon upgrades their LCD screen yet again. Another reason amateur photographers will be happy to either upgrade or flat out purchase the Rebel XSi is because Canon has added an extra half-inch of screen space on the back, making for easier viewing and putting a stop to blurry photos before they get a chance to spread.\n\n- 9-Point AF: The EOS Rebel XSi has a high-precision 9-point wide area AF sensor for fast, accurate focus even in dim lighting. It has a number of focus modes, including One-Shot AF, AI Focus AF, AI Servo AF and Manual. In Live View Function, the EOS Rebel XSi has two AF modes: Quick mode, which uses the camera's standard 9-point AF system, and Live mode, which is a contrast-based AF system that reads the sharpness of subjects right from the imaging sensor, and can be overridden by pressing the AF mode selection button. A familiar feature in PowerShot cameras, Live mode AF uses similar technologies to achieve focus, while Quick mode is more appropriate for capturing action or for shooting in low light.\n\n- Outstanding Image Quality: Canon's CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) sensor captures images with exceptional clarity and tonal range, and offers the most pixels in its class. It offers many of the same new technologies to maximize each pixel's light gathering efficiency that were first seen with the professional EOS-1D Mark III model. It's an APS-C size sensor (22.2 x 14.8mm), and there's an effective 1.6x increase in the lens's marked focal length when attached. Canon's DIGIC III Image Processor dramatically enhances image quality and speeds up all camera operations for intuitive operation. It works in concert with the EOS Rebel XSi's sensor to achieve unprecedented levels of performance in all lighting situations.\n\n- 14-bit A/D Converter: With the EOS Rebel XSi, analog to digital signal conversion is executed by a 14-bit processor, which generates digital data with incredibly smooth tones. Formerly a feature only present in top-of-the-line pro digital SLR cameras, the 14-bit conversion gives incredibly smooth transitions from light to dark colors, with far less risk of \"banding.\" A sky at sunset is a perfect example. With this rich 14-bit gradation the EOS Rebel XSi offers RAW images of the highest quality that can be processed with Canon's Digital Photo Professional software. Even JPEG files, which are always finished at 8-bits per channel, use the full 14-bit conversion initially to generate the best possible color and tonal detail. Another huge benefit of the 14-bit conversion is the Highlight Tone Priority option, which allows critical shooters to increase the level of detail in bright areas of a scene up to one stop, without affecting overall exposure.\n\n- Auto Optimization: The EOS Rebel XSi's Auto Optimization is yet another image-quality tool that comes to the rescue in tricky lighting conditions. It can actually lighten dark areas of a scene while ensuring that bright areas maintain tonal detail. It's now available in all shooting modes, including P, Tv, Av, and Manual.\n- Precision Operation: The EOS Rebel XSi operates with such effortless speed that operation is nothing short of intuitive. With instant startup times, speedy autofocus and minimal shutter lag, the EOS Rebel XSi is one of the fastest cameras available today. It can shoot up to 3.5 frames per second, in bursts of 53 JPEGs or 6 RAW files, so you'll never, ever miss a shot.\n\n- Advanced Features: The EOS Rebel XSi's 35-zone evaluative metering system with improved white balance analyzes light based on each zone in the viewing area, enabling the camera to choose the overall best exposure for the entire scene. It now features a spot meter, which reads a tiny area (about 4%) of the picture for extremely precise metering. It also provides Center-weighted average metering and partial metering for accurate exposure no matter the situation. The EOS Rebel XSi also has an improved, high magnification viewfinder that provides a larger overall view, and increased brightness and clarity. And the EOS Rebel XSi has a Display-Off sensor that automatically turns the LCD monitor off whenever the camera is at the photographer's eye. All relevant shooting information, including ISO, is displayed right in the viewfinder so it's easy to change settings without moving the camera away from the eye.\n\n- Flexible Storage: The EOS Rebel XSi is the first EOS Digital SLR camera to use popular SD and SDHC memory cards only. Compact, inexpensive and available in increasingly large capacities, SD and SDHC memory cards are a perfect complement to the EOS Rebel XSi's compact and lightweight body design.\n\n- Self Cleaning Sensor Unit: It's Back! A key element of minimizing dust is preventing it from clinging to the front surface of the imaging sensor. To combat against this, the EOS Rebel XSi features a Canon-designed Self Cleaning Sensor Unit. The low-pass filter at the front of the sensor shakes off dust automatically with ultrasonic vibrations, removing dust from the sensor assembly. The EOS Rebel XSi has a new coating on the front surface of the low-pass filter, to increase its resistance to dust sticking to the sensor.\n\nThis is about as good as it gets for consumer level SLRs. Canon has done it again with it's innovation and user-friendly design. Well worth the upgrade from the Nikon D40."},{"reviewerName":"teresa cookingham","rating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"this camera sucks.","reviewDate":"June 26, 2015","reviewText":"It sucks.

It is specifically for this reason that I bought the camera (I also wanted a somewhat smaller slr than the one I am currently using, a Nikon D50). The Nikon to eos mount worked quite well, and the camera was able to meter through the lens, and the autofocus confirm seemed to work (of course, the lenses are all manual - but the light goes off to indicate when focus has been achieved). However, I was disappointed that the focus confirmation was not very accurate - photos seemed not perfectly sharp. When I put the Nikon lens (an old 50mm f1.2) back on the D50, the focus confirmation was much more accurate. Perhaps equally important (?more important?), the overall color and \"feel\" of the pictures was definitely better on the old Nikon D50 - they seemed colder on the Canon. Also, the default setting on the Canon, when using its kit lens, seemed to somehow underexpose the pictures. Certainly, it is possible that I could have adjusted things considerably on the camera, and possibly helped things out some; however, I did not have the patience for that, and frankly, did not think the overall feel of the pictures was as good on the Canon as on my old Nikon.\n\nI was very sad to do it, as I was quite excited about the prospect of using lots of old lenses, but ultimately the cameras output did not seem to justify the price, and so I returned it. A HUGE thumbs up, though, to Amazon, for the absolutely painless way they assisted me with everything - the whole experience with them was outstanding.\n\nThis is actually not the first time I have been a little disappointed with Canon output - perhaps it all comes down to personal preferences, but the pictures out of my Nikon just seem a little better. Too bad the Nikons are a bit more expensive, and that I cannot use other (non- Nikon mount) lenses on them."},{"reviewerName":"John Karush","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Awesome camera!","reviewDate":"March 24, 2010","reviewText":"This is an awesome camera! the HD video quality is pretty darn good, most people are surprised that the video I shot came out of this tiny little camera.

I previously owned a Powershot A540, and this SLR is no better than it, for five or six times the money.\n\n1)The camera will regularly not take pictures. Despite the fact that the subject is in focus, the shutter will not release. You press the shutter button, and nothing happens. You press it again, nothing happens, etc. At times, the camera will simply not function.\n\n2) The delay between pictures is ridiculous. The delay on the point and shoot camera was already bad enough. But it's worse on this SLR. It regularly says it is busy and won't do anything. I miss all kinds of pictures waiting for this camera to let me take another picture again.\n\n3) The image stabilization system is a joke. I have just as many blurry pictures on this camera as the point and shoot.\n\n4) The 9-point automatic focus sytem is also useless. This camera is just as bad as the point and shoot at focusing on only one thing and leaving everything else out of focus.\n\n5) This camera will not take closeup pictures. The closeup setting on this camera is meaningless. I can take pictures closer to the subject with my point and shoot than with this camera.\n\n6) The continuous shooting feature of this camera is worthless. Why is it that it only works on the Portrait mode? What good is that? Why not just admit you don't have a continuous shooting feature?\n\n7) Unlike other SLR's, you have to look through the viewfinder to frame a shot, because the LCD screen does not show you what you are shooting. While the LCD may not be a completely accurate depiction of the picture being taken, in most cases it is a sufficient and convenient guide, rather than having to squint throug a small viewfinder.\n\nI have increasingly come to the conclusion that Canon is an inferior camera manufacturer. I only wish I had known that before I spent over $700 on this piece of junk."},{"reviewerName":"T. E.

I can't see why anyone in that position would choose to go with the XSI. The build quality on the 40D is infinitely better. It has weatherproofing and a magnesium alloy body. It's shutter is rated for 100,000 shots whereas the rebel series has been rated for about half that (That means the 40D could last twice as long for 150 bucks more). It has a much better and clearer viewfinder; a pentaprism instead of a pentamirror. It is faster in terms of burst shooting and can reach faster shutter speeds than the XSi (1/8000 sec vs 1/4000). It also has a much larger memory buffer for when you take bursts of photos. The 40D can be pushed to 3200 ISO while the XSi tops out at 1600. This is a big deal when shooting in low light. The 40D also has longer battery life.\n\nFurther, most people will never use 12 Megapixels. 10 is perfectly adequate. I can understand buying an XTi over a 40D. The XTi is half the price. But for the small difference the 40D is definitely the smarter buy when compared to the XSi. If the price comes down, then the XSi will be worth it. Until then. Do yourself a favor and get the 40D. Just my two cents.\n\nMy three stars are strictly based on a price to performance consideration. I'm sure the XSi performs great. Canon dSLR's are excellent all around."},{"reviewerName":"Joel F.
