Goonan","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Compact, affordable, improved w some great unique features","reviewDate":"July 8, 2006","reviewText":"The first thing that impressed me about this camera was how well thought out it was in terms of size, position of controls and practicality. I purchased the version with the 18-55 mm EFS zoom lens and was impressed how light the whole unit was without seeming flimsy. I'm also 6\"0\" tall and have fairly large hands, but I don't find this camera to small to handle at all.\n\nI don't want to repeat a lot of the things other reviewers have said, so I'll make some additional observations that will hopefully add value to what others have said. One of these is a comment about the fact that the camera is faster than the original Rebel due to the 8 MP CMOS and DIGIC II processing image. This gives it higher resolution, faster recovery time between shots and almost instant startup time when compared with the original Rebel. I found the camera overall to be a bargain considering its performance and the fact that they included a good lens.\n\nTwo modes that I appreciated were the While Balance Bracketing and monochrome mode for working with black and white photography. The bracketing allows you to automatically take three images for every shot with different white balancing settings. Given that I can erase the pictures I don't like, I think this is a great feature. I also like that I can experiment with black and white photography.\n\nAnother interesting feature of the camera is the CloseUp mode. It works at wide angle settings and at 55 mm as well. When you use it at 55 mm it magnifies the image and you can focus in as close as 6 inches in order to capture detail in flowers or whatever your subject is. This opens up a lot of possibilities for some interesting shots that would otherwise be difficult.\n\nIn short, this is a lot of camera for the price. I am very pleased with my purchase and pictures can be blown up very large at 8 MP resolution.\n\nWhile I haven't tried it yet, I'm interested in experimenting with some astrophotography using this camera. Given its light weight, small size and accessible controls, I think it might be excellent for some astronomy applications where you need to piggy back a camera on a telescope."},{"reviewerName":"CanAmGuy","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"perfect starter SLR","reviewDate":"July 18, 2013","reviewText":"I've always enjoyed photography, but couldn't justify spending a lot of money on a camera. I came across this one on Amazon, used, for a very reasonable price. reasonable enough that I figured I'd give it a try and see if I liked it, and if not I wouldn't be out a lot of cash. So far, loving it. Still learning all the features on it, but having fun practicing with it. Of the pictures I have taken (the ones that I got right) they look amazing. The used one came with a 1GB flashcard, which I found out isn't quite big enough if you are taking photo's at a wedding (had to quickly download them and clear the card for so I could take more photo's). Not a big issue, will just pick up a bigger card here on amazon. I would also recommend a second battery as well.

I have not been happy with the sharpness of the point and shoot cameras so I thought it might be time to try the digital SLRs for sharpness and higher resolution.\n\nI ordered the silver body Rebel XT camera as I like it better than a faux pro black camera (this is afterall not a pro camera), and black cameras look dirty or dusty all the time. It came rapidly from Amazon.com. I have had mostly good pictures with this camera, but there are a few things I would add to the other posters.\nPro: compact, light, fast, good in outdoor daylight.\nCons: in incandescent light the AWB is only fair. The picture color is better if you set this manually in a manual mode rather than using the AUTO mode.\nSometimes the autofocus has a tough time figuring out where things are indoors, and sometimes there is severe hunting, with an occasional focus which is way off. You can fool this autofocus in situations where the subject is further back than foreground objects unless you set the focus point ahead of time, which is usually not what you think about on the spot.\nISO speeds in AUTO mode is 400, and cannot be set higher. You can set this to 1600 with very little noise in the non-auto modes.\nKit lens is a bit soft in my example, despite good reviews. I got in a Tamron lens (28-75) which seems sharper, but some say this lens has a yellowish cast, which I have not seen yet. One other thing pointed out by the professionals: you have to wait till the buffer has saved the picts to the CF card or they will be lost. So long as the little red led has stopped flashing you are OK.\n\nOverall I am happy with this camera. I wish it were a bit more user friendly and intuitive, and there was more control over the ISO and AWB in auto modes. You can't expect the kit lens to be very good considering the price it is, but I would rather have a better prime lense than a cheap zoom which you have to replace anyway. Next time round I will just get a body and forget about the kit lens. For those looking to step up from a point and shoot film camera or a lessor digital, this is the right direction. I do wonder if I should have got the 20D instead, but for the difference in price, I got my Tamron lens and I am happy I did it this way. Good luck and happy picture taking to you all...\n\nEdit 4/10/2005: before doing my 24-75 zoom Tamron lens rebate, I wanted to be absolutely sure there were no front focus issues with this lens in this camera. Some have said the Tamron lens might have a front focus issue, and I spent a lot of time yesterday and today specifically looking for front focus problems, and found none. I took dozens of pictures indoors and out, with flash and without, and found no consistent problem worth sending the lens or camera back for. As I said above the focus is sometimes off indoors, probably due to low light, but much more often than not it is good. Outdoors today I shot some sharp pictures which focussed spot on, and I am pleased with the Tamron len's performance in my Rebel XT."},{"reviewerName":"Eaglechick","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"DSLRs; worth every penny of the extra hundred or so you spend","reviewDate":"January 8, 2008","reviewText":"I researched DSLRs for the last year before choosing the Canon; I had a Fuji finepix that I loved, but I wanted something more advanced now that I know what I am doing with a digital camera. I also wanted speed; my son plays soccer and football and the regular digitals are too slow for fast-moving bodies. So far, I am extremely pleased with the fast-action sports photos I have taken. After playing with the camera for a few months and reading the manual thoroughly, I realized using the manual Tv mode outdoors and setting the shutter speed to around 1600, I get crystal clear, \"action\" photos so detailed you can sometimes see the letters on the ball and the dirt flying up, etc. With the shutter speed set at that speed or even a little lower, I can still take multiple pictures per second like in the sports mode, but much clearer and crisper. I will never buy a regular digital camera again after having a DSLR; I also purchased the 55-250 IS lens for the further away shots, and I feel that the lens is a must-have for anyone who wants to take great shots from a distance.

I finally decided on 350D for its balance of a great value and a huge variety of after-market accessories and web-based support and advice.\n\nI recently received this camera from Amazon and, though my expectation was rather high and the camera did not blow me away, I'm very happy with the purchase.\n\nPROS:\n- Light, compact, and ergonomically designed.\n- The camera does NOT feel plasticky at all. It feels solid and radiates the craftsmanship of a prosumer product.\n- Easy to use. Take the camera out of the box and start snapping away.\n- The bundled software is useful if not professional quality.\n- Amazing flash performance. Pictures taken in total dark comes out looking professionally lit.\n- Quiet when snapping pictures. Fast startup time. Very good batter life.\n- For a fan of Canon, add to the inventory of other Canon products, from camera to lenses to printers to photo paper.\n\nCONS:\n- The EF-S zoom lens that comes with it is rather slow and a bit disappointing in picture quality.\n- The camera - as many reviewers complained - is ergonomic but does not feel very well balanced. It's very awkward to take a picture with only one hand holding the camera - you need two hands. No matter how I tried, my grip on the camera never feels comfortable.\n- Documentation is buggy and uneven. Some of the step-by-step instructions simply do not work, and I had to figure out the correct steps by playing with the controls myself.\n\n(...)Amazon double-boxed the package, which arrived without a dent."},{"reviewerName":"Barry S.

I'd held off on buying a digital SLR due mainly to price. Finally, with the Digital Rebel XT, I could buy for less than $1,000 the quality that pros paid $7,000 for just a few years ago.\n\nLikes:\n\n- Size and feel: it's about as small as you're going to get for an SLR, yet it still feels good in your hands, with all controls pretty accessible.\n\n- Speed: having spent three years cursing shutter lag on my point-n-shoot S110, it's amazing to be able to get off 2 or 3 frames per second. You'll quickly find that you shoot 3-4x as many shots in a day, just because you can get them off quickly.\n\n- Battery life - I purchased a second battery but have yet to have to use it. I can shoot 200+ shots and the battery is still going strong.\n\n- automatic modes (portrait, action, etc) with options to override focus mode\n\n- Basic 18-55mm EF-S lens is a solid, well-performing lens\n\nDislikes:\n\nNo strong complaints overall. It's taking me a little longer than I expected to learn all of the control options on the menu. Also, in bright daylight, the menu's not that easy to see on the LCD.\n\nAll in all, the combination of high picture quality (equal to that of the 20D) and virtually no shutter lag makes this a fantastic entry level digital SLR. The ability to change lenses, use filters and modify settings as you would in the 35mm world changes the whole realm of digital photography.

The landscape pictures that come out on my Dell Ultrasharp 2007FP monitor really blow me away.

This DSLR model is the least expensive currently only offered at Amazon, if you like to take your photography experience to another notch while not busting your pocket, this is it. Since DSLR cameras depend primarily on the lens, you can always start off with the kit lens, and gradually migrate into other pro lens given your shooting habits. Sure there are other newer models available from Canon as well, but $400 saved for an investment of a much better lens make this one a no-brainer.

It's amazingly sharp for $80.\n\nBe advised Canon is no longer offering updates to this camera's firmware. Not that it needs it... I assume from that, that canon has discontinued this camera.\n\n8 megapixel is all I need or I may have looked at the XTi.

While this is not Canon's or anyone elses top of the line, it is a great choice for an amteur or semi-professional photographer.\n\nI have been a technical writer, so I need photos both in color and B&W. With 35 mm film SLR, I always carried two - one with color and one with black and white film. With the Digital Rebel, I can take both color and B&W with a single camera - a real plus. Since a lot of my photos have been taken in a manufacturing plant or in the field, I like the image stabilized EF lenses and the ability to select either aperture or shutter priority - and let the camera thoose the appropriate shutter speed or aperture.

However, I grew tired of dealing with poor auto-focus, unnatural colors, lack of manual controls, etc, and after my friend let me borrow her Nikon D30 for a bit, I decided that it was time for me to upgrade to a DSLR. After days upon days of research, I decided to go with this camera, pairing it with a Canon EF 28-105mm f/3.5-4.5 II USM Macro Lens, which I bought from a separate dealer. The camera came right on time in a nice box which contained software, a USB cord, a charger and battery, manuals, and of course, the camera itself.\nIn terms of ergonomics, the camera with the lens attached maintained a decent, balanced weight. I had no problem in terms of holding the camera, but others with larger hands may feel that the grip is not big enough to comfortably hold onto the camera. Performance-wise, the camera simply amazed me. it created excellent reproductions of colors, and it also took absolutely beautiful macro shots. The camera's also got a pretty good battery life, but it wouldn't hurt to get a backup. If you're an amateur or hobby photographer who wants to upgrade to a DSLR camera, you should definitely consider this camera.

I got this one because it would be compatible with all the lenses and filters that I already have for the film Rebel, plus have the convenience of a digital camera. I am learning a lot more from this one than I could have from the film version. With the film version, you have to remember what you did to each frame, or write it down. But, with the digital camera, all I have to do is look at the details, either in the camera, or on my computer to know what I did to each shot I take. It's not exactly an ideal camera to take with you everywhere you go, because it's a little bulky, plus you have to carry around the additional lenses, filters and whatever else you might want.

It's lighter (which really does matter when you have a heavy lens on) and faster in many respects than the 300D because of the DIGIC II image processor.\nThe image sensor (8MP) is comparable to the 20D's which is 8.2 MP.\nThe continues shooting speed is also a bit better at 3.0 fps.\nThe control layout was redesigned with a new drive mode button, new metering mode and AF buttons.

Save your money on the Rebel XTi and purchase the XT, so you can invest in some nice lenses, filters, etc. A nicer lens will get you a lot farther than a slightly larger LCD screen and 2 megapixels will. Honestly, unless you are looking to blow up you pictures to a full poster size, there is no need for more MP as they don't determine the sharpness of your photos; they determine how large you can blow your prints up while not distorting them.\n\nAs for the LCD screen, whether you have a 1.8 or a 2.5 inch, the screen is so small that every photo will look sharp until you put it on your faithful computer screen; when the real truth comes out. So regardless of 1.8 or 2.5, you still need to zoom in on every photo on the screen to check for sharpness.\n\nThis camera does shoot in RAW as well which is always a nice plus.\n\nThe size of this camera has been a concern for some. I have large hands, as I'm 6'4, and with the added battery pack grip, it fits my hands perfectly. The battery pack is a huge plus anyway for those all day hikes/photo shoots when you don't want to keep changing the battery every few hours.\n\nThe features/options on this camera are enough to keep every amateur photo enthusiast entertained for years to come, as well as those considering the entry to professional work.\n\nAs for the kit lens, I haven't used it or seen it in action, but if you are on a budget, the reviews I've read assure me that it will cover all of your needs until you are able to invest in a more expensive lens.

I won't launch into superlatives you can read in all the other reviews other than to agree that it is the best thing this amateur has ever bought.\n\nIf the XT is going to someone that will only use it 5-10 times a year, the kit lens is fine.\n\nMy advice for those like me that are trying to step up into taking photographs rather than pictures? Buy the camera as a body only, spend 80ish dollars on the 50mm 1.8 prime lens, and another 20ish on the remote. You will still come out cheaper than if you buy the XT with a kit lens AND have an amazing, fast lens that gets raving reviews on Amazon and elsewhere. Check the lens reviews for yourself, especially if you're not familiar with prime vs. zoom lenses. The tiny remote is handy too!\n\nI'm betting you will eventually buy at least one more lens than what you start with to explore the capabilities of the XT. This is true whether you start out with the kit or the 1.8. I use the 28-135 IS and the 1.8.

I was torn between the XTi and the XT. After doing much research, learning, and getting information overload, I decided for my needs, I'd pick up the XT. From what I read, the difference in MP wouldn't be much of an issue for me. The self cleaning on the XTi would be awesome. It came down to an issue with money and \"wife\" approval. At just under $600 with kit lens, the XT was \"psychologically\" a little easier to buy than the XTi. Anyway, I'm in the tech field and began thinking of the bodies like computers. New and better stuff will keep coming out faster and cheaper, in this hobby the lenses seem to be the real investment.\n\nAnyway, so far I love the camera. I'm learning still but I do like the creative modes the XT offers. Kind of like step learning. I've got down all the terminology and what each thing does, but need to learn how it actually works and think the creative modes offered on XT are the perfect bridge.\n\nI have absolutely no complaints so far about the camera (although i did get the dreaded 99 error that I've read about, but I turned off the camera and it went away. I hope I didn't get a dud).\n\nThe Good:\n\n1. Great value in my opinion\n2. Camera feels good overall (some have complained about it being too light or feeling cheap). I don't get this impression at all. Although one of the cons I'm listing does have to do with the shape.\n3. Easy to use with plenty of different modes to help you along the way\n\nThe Bad:\n\n1. Like others have complained, the grip feels a bit compacted. I don't have really big hands, but it feels a tad unnatural holding the camera. Its not terrible though, but its a little annoying\n2. Not necessarily against this camera, but one thing I didn't think about is that you can't shoot with glasses on. Too hard. But it does have an adjustment that goes to -2.5 (right at my vision) and I can shoot with no glasses, or contacts.\n3. The kit lens leaves something to be desired. I'm a newbie and I can already feel the limitations of this lens. Under sunny conditions, the lens performs pretty good, no complaints. But indoor photography sucks for lack of a better word. Plus the range doesn't seem useful. Its a short telephoto and maybe a long wide. Would I buy it with the kit lens? Yeah, for only $70 or $80 more, I think its worth it. However, if choosing b/w the kit lens and picking up the nifty fifty (Canon 50mm prime), I might have been better off picking up the body only and getting the nifty fifty. I'll know when I actually order the nifty fifty. I guess I felt I wanted some range, so I went with the kit.\n\nI am going to pick up the nifty fifty to see what this camera can really do. I'm pumped about the hobby and so far so good. I think I'd be even more excited if I had better glass on the cam. But I'm still learning. Maybe the kit lens isn't all that bad and its the photographer.\n\nThe only bad thing about this hobby though is that initially, I thought I would be happy with the body + kit lens. Now I want more glass, better flash, monopod, etc, etc."},{"reviewerName":"Michael D.

After much online research and several sessions flipping a quarter, I ordered the Canon EOS 8MP digital Rebel from Amazon.\n\nAlthough lugging it around Ireland for 2 weeks was something of a challenge, it exceeded my expectations from a photographic standpoint. The photos are perfect, 8X11 enlargements are crisp and detailed, the colors are true...

I have had this camera for about 3 weeks and have taken a lot of pictures with it. Having used a \"Rebel XS\" film camera for about 15 years before it died, I was glad to see how similar the operation and feel is on the XT. This made for a short learning curve.\n\nI was hesitant to leave film for digital, but am totally glad I did. The advantages far outweigh the drawbacks. One adjustment I am having to make is that pohtos are slightly underexposed on the fully automatic setting, this is NOT a problem with the camera, but the nature of the technology and something that is easily overcome.\n\nThis is an excellent camera for the person who wants really top quality snapshots AND the ability to go well beyond snapshots on occasion. I actually think a pro could use this camera with success, since it is my belief that a truly creative photographer can take top quality photographs with a box camera - the bells and whistles are nice but the most important part of this machine is the operator."},{"reviewerName":"mom to 3 boys","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Finally","reviewDate":"April 5, 2008","reviewText":"I owned a canon rebel film loading camera for years and my pictures were always perfect.

Canon's kit lens gets 1-star for destroying the whole experience. The combination is worse than just about any modest point-n-shoot. The upshot ... most buyers who are the slightest bit picky will discover the cost of the kit is a lot more than it appears.\n\nUnless you are not going to be very picky, ditch the kit and research the cost of replacement lenses, first. Start with Canon's professional 'L' and consumer EF-S just to get the PUCKERING over with. Then, take heart.\n\nWhile many will offer Sigma, I like Tamron lensing made for Canon EOS bodies. For starters, Tamron offers a 6-year new warranty, the best I've seen (NOT honored on gray market copies) and it just seems their lenses get, copy for copy, a tad better nod with a slightly higher price. Ideas include Tamron's basic 18-200mm, improved 18-250mm and the too-new-for-review 28-300mm with optical stabilization ... all of them a one-lens-does all idea ranging from $350 to $600 new, roundhouse.\n\nIf you are REALLY picky, it's tough to beat the performance combo of a current $400 Tamron 17-50mm (very well rated by pro and consumer) plus a $140 Tamron 70-300mm basic telephoto with macro, a surprisingly good lens for the average person's need. But, don't take my word ... research hard and find your own gems.\n\nWhat you get with the kit is a faster, more capable camera with sorely degraded optics. To get the results your Rebel XT can deliver, the cost is closer to $1000."},{"reviewerName":"Hugh Long","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great camera for the price","reviewDate":"August 29, 2008","reviewText":"I bought this camera couple months ago, got a great deal on Amazon.com at that time - camera, len included and 2GB memory card for under $450.

The main reason for the switch was because I wanted to take night shot without having the lag that is normally associated with Point and Shoot cameras. My impression:\n\nThe Good stuff:\n\n-Camera shutter speed is fast. It was better than I had expected.\n\n-Easier to use than expected.\n\n-Shoots great photos in Auto mode\n\n-Good amount of manual selections to work with\n\n-Lightweight and small\n\n-Compatible with many Canon lenses\n\n-Priced very low for a DSLR\n\nThe Bad stuff (opinion):\n\n-Camera feels cheap. Too much plastic, but I'm sure canon had to cut cost somewhere to be able to sell the camera this cheap. At least they cheapen the external rather than the internal.\n\n-Cannot turn off flash in some mode. You'll have to either set the exposure, aperture, or the contrast in order for the flash to not come on. It's very annoying since some of the photos I want to take do not need more light.\n\n-The camera will not take pictures because there is not enough light for a particular setting. I cannot see why the camera cannot just let me take the photo and let me do whatever I want with it. I am using the camera to take picture. I'm the photographer, not the camera.\n\n-LCD screen is a bit small (hence the XTi is better in this department)\n\n-Camera kit does not come with a standard memory card. I recommend at least 1GB. You'll be taking more pictures than you'll anticipate.\n\nConclusion: For the price I paid for this camera, I am happy with my purchase. It's a great camera, and I can see why it's been one of the best selling cameras in the world. However, if you can fork out a bit more for the XTi, I would recommend so for the bigger LCD and the self-sensor cleaning system.

I have 2 very active kids, 6 and 8. I've had the camera for a few months and love it! The biggest advantage to me is that I can fire away at the kids continuously, and dump the bad pics, which is a significant percentage! I have caught far better pics than ever before with my previous camera. The first set of prints I ordered online are wonderful. For action shots this camera is perfect. The advantage of the SLR is that you don't have the delay found in the majority of point-and-shoot cameras marketed to people like me, and the burst rate is more than an amateur like me would need. I found that the P&S type of camera caused me to miss the good shot more frequently than getting the good shot.\n\nMake sure to get a big memory Compact Flash card. I've found good deals for 2 gig cards with rebates, which can hold 500+ pics in JPEG format, and still a few hundred even if you shoot in the RAW format. I have not found problems with the 40X write speed.\n\nThe battery life is very reasonable, allowing at least 250 shots before recharging in my exerience. I also recommend shopping for extra batteries, which can be found for a very good deal for the non Canon brand. I have not noticed any problems with the lower priced battery.\n\nI purchased the optional battery pack, not really for extended battery life (it holds two batteries), but because I wanted a larger grip area and the pack has extra controls and shutter button for vertical shooting, which I find to be a huge advantage.\n\nThe software that comes with the camera is reasonable at doing basic photo editing (red eye reduction, etc.), but those who are more into it probably would be happier getting 3rd party software for in depth editing.\n\nI also bought the Lowepro 100 Slingshot pack to carry the camera. It just fits this model with room to spare for accessories.\n\nFor those amateurs who are willing to spend some extra cash to get these advantages, I believe the camera is well worth it, especially if you're a family man and those kids will only be this age a short time!"},{"reviewerName":"Nils","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Good but dated.","reviewDate":"January 31, 2008","reviewText":"The Digital Rebel XT is a pretty fantastic camera if you just look at the unit itself.

Canon released information about the XSi which includes a new battery type and SD cards instead of CF.

It is my fourth digital camera in the last 8 years. First I had an Olympus 1.3MP (D320L) that took great pictures, but had poor resolution for printing and literally ate my batteries! However, I traveled around the world with it and was perfect! Also, it was pretty fast compared to the two digital cameras that I bought after. Then I bought a Nikon CoolPix 775, 2.1 MP. I was kind of dissapointed because my previous camera took better and more colorful pictures. Also, this camera took very bad pictures with flash, many faces came out just white. However, the battery lasted much longer and the resolution was OK for printing, so I kept it for a while. My third camera was a Sony DSCP150, a powerful 7.2 MP camera, in which you could see the blurriest pictures ever! It was terrible! Also, it was so slow, even with Sony Memory Stick cards, that if you tried to catch a baby making a funny face, probably you would get him gone to highschool or married! I had it for a few months and the decided to buy the Canon Rebel XT... the best choice I've made in these 8 years!

I did a little research on this material and found that it is virtually unbreakable and in laminated form is used to make \"bullet-resistant glass.\" Of course, no matter how tough the body is, something else will break, such as the lens or the internal workings, if the camera is dropped on a hard surface. That's why I always place the camera's strap around my neck before handling it.\n\nAlthough a couple of reviewers stated that the camera feels too light, I've found that it has plenty of heft with my 28-135mm lens.\n\nThe Rebel XT is an excellent camera.

The XT is a great second camera for me as it has most all the features of the 20D and is MUCH lighter. 8 megapixels and the RAW + Jpeg mode are new as is a faster start-up and a greater image buffer for when you are shooting action. Using PhotoShop CS2, I can take the RAW files and turn them into 70 meg files with amazing quality and clarity.\n\nI recommend the external power grip as it adds a vertical grip and also the ability to use AA batteries or 2 lithiums! Consider also adding the 420EX flash if you plan to do a lot of flash photography. The 420EX will allow you to save the camera's battery and also give you a more powerful flash that syncs at ALL shutterspeeds in Program, TV and AV modes.

I've been very happy with it. Great pictures and overall, very easy to use. The kit lens is cheaply made and a little slow to focus, but photo quality is good, and the 18-55mm range is appropriate for the smaller sensor.\n\nAs others have commented, the grip is probably more suited to the average woman's hand than a man's, and can be uncomfortable with on-camera flash. Also, no ISO shown on the LCD. Since you can change ISO so easily, it would be nice to have a quick reminder what it's set for, and not get extra noise when you don't need high ISO.\n\nThe software is ok, but a card reader and Photoshop are the way to go. Adobe Bridge makes working with camera RAW much faster and easier. If you're a student or know one, you can get MAJOR discounts (about 75%) on Adobe Creative suite or Photoshop through the college bookstore.\n\nBasically, I would have bought the 30D if I could afford it, but for half the price you definitely get more than 3/4 the camera, with just a few minor differences that you can live with if you're reluctant to part with another 600 bucks."},{"reviewerName":"Evelyn Schmitten","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"MAking money right outta the box!","reviewDate":"March 23, 2007","reviewText":"This camera is just plain awesome.

(a 2003 camera in 2012 technology...)","reviewDate":"March 13, 2012","reviewText":"This camera is nearly a decade old. This review was written in March 2012 and this camera came out in 2003.\nI bought it because I was interested in beginning photography, and didn't want to spend too much. So I bought an older model to get the feel.\n\nI read countless reviews before buying this camera.\nI am very impressed. A family member of mine has a Canon XSi that I have used a few times, and I honestly think this camera is much better quality.\n\n-The first thing I noticed when I opened the box was that it was very small, very narrow.\n-In reviews, I read that this camera has a tiny view finder, equivalent to viewing \"a postage stamp at the end of a tunnel.\" I do not find this to be accurate. Sure, it would be nice for the viewfinder to be a tad larger, but its current size is perfectly manageable.\n-I was worried about the 8MP compared to the modern 12MP or so. I shouldn't have even hesitated. The detail on this thing is quite good. I uploaded three photos. One of paint splatters to show off its colour. Second of the Santa Fe railyard to show off its nice contrast. Third of a tree to show off its detail. Those pictures were taken with a 28-80 lens, rather than the kit lens.\n\n-One thing that really bugs me truly is the small LCD. I barely get an example of the image with that thing. The only true way I can determine if an image is good is when I upload it to my computer. Newer models have larger LCDs, some 3 inches, which I'm pretty sure is twice the one on the XT!\n-The memory cards for this thing are different than current models, and can go up into the $40's for only a few GB!(sandisk compact flash) Luckily mine came with one, but be warned.\n-Sometimes the shutter-release-button (not so great on my terminology yet) sticks. I'll hold it half-down to focus, and it won't take the picture when I try to push it down fully. Happens probably 3/10 shots. Mostly why I gave this 4 stars instead of 5.\n\nSo if you're a beginner, this camera is perfect for you."},{"reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Very good older camera","reviewDate":"May 20, 2019","reviewText":"As expected due to age of item.

To be frank I did not compare with Nikon counterparts or other Canon cameras, I also have never used another SLR before so I went with what most reviews said about the XT. Almost bought the XTi but price difference at the time was $200. Plus I love the information screen on these cameras and dont mind the small LCD screen. XTi seems a better deal now as the price difference has shrunk (bye bye XT). Anyways, this is a GREAT camera. Pictures are way way better than a conventional digital camera. Even at ISO 1600 pictures look great. Bought a Canon 50mm 1.8, and Tamron 17-50 F2.8 + Tamron 70-300 lens. Great combo, stored kit lens in the closet (ok lens but kind of boring).

Actually, it's still my only SLR camera, but I'm ready to purchase a newer model after having used this one for about 5 years. I loved this one so much that I thought I should comment on it first.\n\nThis camera is very easy to use. It looked a little intimidating at first, but after I spent some quality time with the camera and the manual, I realized that it wasn't difficult to use after all. It does take practice to make the most of the features offered with this camera, but it's hard not to take a great picture with this camera. The lens that comes with it is a great general purpose lens, but be warned that additional lenses can be addictive!\n\nIt's a small camera that is easy to hold and balance. It's not very heavy, either, so it's easy to handle when I have to get in awkward positions to get a good shot.\n\nIf you are a novice considering a high quality digital SLR camera, I highly recommend Canon. It's not just for pros or experienced photographers. The Canon Rebel has a huge following and there's an amazing amount of support available to help you get started and achieve the results you are after. The internet is filled with tutorials and community forums with free advice from users who love to share their knowledge of this camera. There are also plenty of books and even DVDs that can be purchased to help you learn everything you need to know.

I have seen what others have said about the auto focus, it tends to focus on the wrong things in the seven point mode. You can bypass this in the P mode by choosing the central point focus, but then you lose out on the other Auto features. The only other problem I have had is that the flash sometimes seems out of sync. Some of my shots you can actually see the flash on the left side of the picture, that it hasn't made it across in time.\n\nBut don't let this slight irritations stop you from buying it!

When lighting levels are low the camera pops up the flash automatically, however with this one several malfunctions occured simultaneously:\n*the flash popped up, but did not fire\n*the camera made a weird rapidfire clicking sound like keys being quickly pressed on an old-fashioned typewriter\n*the camera would \"seize\" or lock-up, the only recourse being to cycle the power off and on manually\n*the only item then displayed on the LCD was a low battery warning (even though the battery was fully charged. This indicator would revert to charged status after cycling the power.)\n*lastly, of course, no image would be stored.\n\nI will say Amazon was exceptionally prompt in issuing a replacement order.\n\nI've owned a Canon A-1 for 23 years and it's seen a lot of use.

If you don't plan to have larger than 11\" X 14\" print enlargements, the XT really is a smart choice for the serious amateur on a tight budget. To use more than 8 Megapixels doesn't do much except allow larger prints, but only with lenses that are better the kit lens that usually comes with with the camera body.

Lots of fun, get a zoom lense if you don't have one. I used it with a Kensington 2GB Compact Flash card. I took about 700 pictures at Medium/Fine resolution and had room for 300-400 more pictures. Some of the button placement takes some getting used to for quick shots... but no real complaints. Download a manual if you don't believe me regarding the features.

The experience has been fantastic. The pictures are nothing less than stunning. Colors are great, resolution is amazing, and the software package is very complete and easy to use.\n\nProbably the best features are the number of modes that are available, and the ease of use. It can be set to a full program mode, and used as a point and click snapshot camera by anyone at all, or put into full manual mode for the more experienced.\n\nI do have a couple of suggestions. Order this body without the Canon lens. I upgraded to a Sigma 28-300 mm Macro Zoom for about the cost of the original lens, and now have one lens for virtually any situation.\n\nAlso, get top notch compact flash card. I bought high speed, 1 GB Lexar 80x flash because I really wanted the ability to take high speed repetative pictures. I was not disappointed. You can either take one picture after another about as fast as you can hit the sutter, or put the camera into repeat-shot mode and hold the shutter button down. This is a great feature.\n\nAlso order a spare battery or two. It takes a lot of pictures on a single charge, but seems to go from a full battery indication down to dead real fast, so there's not a lot of warning that you need to charge up.\n\nAll in all, a very outstanding bit of technology."},{"reviewerName":"D M Pax","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Amazing Hi-Def Photos, Speed, Quality @ a Great Price! 6-Stars!!!!","reviewDate":"January 10, 2008","reviewText":"- As one of my X'mas Gift's, my GF purchased the Rebel XT 8MP Digital SLR Black 'body'.\nSome of you might have come across some of my other product Reviews and might recall that I use exclusively Canon & Nikon Digital & 35mm cameras.\nI still own several 35mm models from each manufacturer, and have some very\nexpensive lenses that were in storage.

Anything faster will not improve camera speed... only \"download to PC speed\".\n\nSelf timer is 10 seconds, and I cannot change it to 2 seconds, although you can change setting to \"Mirror Lockup: On\" which will then give a \"2 second delay\" while using the self timer function.\n\nAdorama Camera shipped my Canon Rebel XT w/ kit lense FASTER than Amazon shipped my 75-300mm USM lense.

Colors are vivid, white balance is spot on, and automatic ISO selection is OK. For the real enthusiast, the multitude of options gives something for nearly every situation.\n\nAs with any DSLR, shot composition is done exclusively through the viewfinder. This is not a limitation once you realize the advantages of optical correctness in shot composition. The RAW output comes in handy for print use of the shots.\n\nOverall, a great buy!"},{"reviewerName":"Don Juan","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Price is fine","reviewDate":"January 17, 2019","reviewText":"Quality is not good"},{"reviewerName":"D.

This way you won't loose it and have to buy another one.\n\nI wish I had a better lens though. This is just a basic one that doesn't get you too close to any action.

Despite some minor complaints with the design of the camera, I enjoyed it for just over 12 months until it seemed the battery was quickly fizzling out and then suddenly stopped powering on all together. I thought it was a poor battery so I ordered 2 more, which had no effect. Canon tech support was compltely useless and bascially told me that the only option was to send it in. There are not local shops to fix these cameras because they are so intricate and specialized. So I went ahead and spent the money to send it in, which isn't cheap when you add the insurance factor. Now I just found out that it will cost $228 to get the thing fixed. That's a lot of money for something I owned for such a short period of time! However, I feel it has to be paid because of the amount of money I already invested in it and how much more it would cost just to buy a new camera. To add to my frustrations they never indicated what was wrong with the camera. All I was told was how much it would cost to fix it. Just like another reviewer asked, is it wrong to think that such an expensive piece of equipment should last longer than 13-14 months? Needless to say I have lost my faith in Canon and don't plan on buying another one of their cameras. Now that I go back and look at these camera reviews again I am seeing that other people had the same problem as me...what a disappointment.\n\nFYI - Should this happen to you and you haven't sent your camera in yet, the written warranty is 12 months, but the Canon repair rep told us they will honor warranty repairs up to 14 months (they don't advertise that)."},{"reviewerName":"ron palmer","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Good Deal","reviewDate":"March 4, 2016","reviewText":"Very pleased.

At 8MP it is all the serious amateur will need for good prints up to 11x14. It is very user-friendly and I judge user-friendly by how often I have to refer to the manual. All controls are easily accessible so it is easy to switch from 100 to 400 ISO or from flash to no flash or from aperature priority to speed priority. Also, there is vely little delay between shots. My only quarrel with this camera is that the resolution choices do not go low enough. If you know you want to use photos on the Internet, you don't need more than 200 KB; larger resolution settings use up memory space both on the memory card and on the computer and are slow to send with e-mail.

Rich colors, practically no noise, sharp and full of detail. The A-DEP mode is my favorite feature for those arty shots. The instant response makes for much better photos than a compact digital camera.\n\nFor me, the killer feature of the Canon over other DSLRs and high end all-in-one cameras is the usable ISO 1600. Yes, there's noise, but only about as much as my old PowerShot S100 produced all the time. Put a cheap 50mm f/1.8 lens on, and you can take handheld photos indoors without flash. In old churches, even.\n\nThe only downside with the camera is that your 50mm lens becomes an 80mm, and it's very expensive to get anything equivalent to a wide angle lens on a film SLR because you need it to be a 20mm or less.

I even recently purchased another 400 dollar lens... and have a long list (thousands of dollars worth) of new toys (photography equipment) I *NEED* to buy.\n\nI do let my wife use the camera every once in awhile... but boy was this the best Christmas give I ever got."},{"reviewerName":"Mema","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Five Stars","reviewDate":"March 16, 2018","reviewText":"Awsome camera for beginner"},{"reviewerName":"Alyssa S","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"A little bit old and busted","reviewDate":"July 26, 2014","reviewText":"I certainly wouldn't purchase this camera today, but at the time I purchased it, it was a good value for the money. It's a beginner's DSLR for sure, and while lacking many of the neat features that I take for granted on my new XT, it remains a fair beginner's DSLR for those in the market for an older camera. I would almost always recommend that anyone getting into photography buy something newer rather than older, and this is no exception. It's a noticeably slower to focus, shoot, and startup and shut-down compared to my newer Canon XT. Fortunately, I was able to transfer all of my lenses to my new camera was which was a nice way to save a bit a money. I could see this being an acceptable \"beater\" camera for someone who must have the lenses, but at this price point, you'd be well tempted (and rightfully so) to go for a point-and-shoot if your cell phone lacks an acceptable camera."},{"reviewerName":"Guy K.","rating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Two Stars","reviewDate":"September 9, 2016","reviewText":"Had to send it to canon to have it repaired, pins missing in the flash memory bay."},{"reviewerName":"Cristina Dominguez","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"... for my son for his birthday couldn't be more happier.

The upgrades to later versions give you a larger display screen, sure, but the basic functionality doesn't change much for at least two generations. While I'd like to be able to preview the picture in the display (which you can't do on this model), the quality of photos as well as the excellent feature set (all laid out in other reviews) make this an excellent choice.\n\nCombined with the incredible array of excellent lenses, the compact size, excellent battery life and great feature set make the Rebel XT a great choice on the used market."},{"reviewerName":"R.

Time to replace the Sony and move up a notch! Having been well-impressed with the Rebel 6.3 and the two lenses we'd added (EF 55-200 4.5-5.6 USM and the superb EF 700-200 2.8 with Canon's 2X extender bought used), we decided to jump on the Digital Rebel XT with the 18-55 lens.\n\nIt arrived Thursday, and we sent it back Monday. Here's why. It was too small. Smaller is usually better, but the XT started to feel and look like a toy camera, or at least a point-and-shoot. My wife and I both have smallish hands, and the XT was bordering on being too small to be ergonomic for us. With the 70-200 lens attached, the Rebel XT disappeared.\n\nThe second why is features. This is not a knock on the XT, which is a fine (excellent, really) camera with significant improvements over the original Digital Rebel. When we sent the XT back, we got Canon's 20D. Aha! you say. The XT and the 20D are basically the same camera. Not completely, and here's Canon's language comparing the two:\n\n\"There are, of course, some very real differences between the EOS Digital Rebel XT digital camera and the more advanced EOS 20D. While the 20D SLR includes performance features such as faster continuous shooting speed (5 frames per second [fps] vs. 3 fps) with larger burst capability (23 frames vs. 14 frames) and custom function settings (18 vs. 9) that more than justify its heftier price tag, this new Rebel XT model was created for those dedicated SLR users who are migrating to digital for the first time and don't wish to give up the flexibility an SLR system offers.\"\n\nAfter using the Digital Rebel and three lenses (plus extender) we evolved from point-and-shoot to serious amateurs, and now we're knocking on the door of \"prosumer.\" The 20D puts us there. It also uses the same batteries as the Digital Rebel, which is a plus. Like the Digital Rebel, the 20D is the size of a traditional SLR and easier to handle than the XT, even if it weighs a bit more.\n\nThis is not a rip on the XT, but a word to the wise for folks like us who feel ready to move to the next level. We took some fine photos with the XT, which we aren't discarding just because we sent back the XT.\n\nA final note: If you get the XT (and that is not a bad thing), get the body only and a lens other than the 18-55 that comes standard in the Digital Rebel and XT kits. Again, this is a fine lens with good, middle-of-the-road capability. But if you're getting serious, you need all the lens you can afford, or even a little more than you can afford. The Canon EF-S 17-85 4.5-5.6 gives a lot of range and versatility and would be great with an XT if you're trying for really good photos while keeping life simple and your camera-lens package light. Even better is the EF-S 10-22 3.5-4.5. But the prize of our collection is the EF 24-70 2.8. It provides superb performance. Yes, the cheapest of those is about the price of an XT body. You get what you pay for. We were lucky enough to have fallen into a little cash and put it into a 20D and a great lens (24-70), a really good lens (10-22), and a relatively compact versatile lens that performs well in good light (17-85).\n\nIf you're sitting on the fence as to your photographic future, I hope this helps."},{"reviewerName":"TheBrownThor","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great entry camera.","reviewDate":"February 7, 2018","reviewText":"Great DSLR camera for an entry into photography and all buttons worked as stated."},{"reviewerName":"Jeannine J.

Who is thinking of buying his next camera.\n\n2. Have never used SLR before.\n\n3. Wonder if it is really worth it to spend extra for Rebel, instead of a good point-n-shoot from Canon (for half the price?).\n\nWell, Yes it is worth it, even the complete automatic mode is much better than best in the class point and shoot. And as you try other semi-automatic modes (like sports, night, portrait, closeup), you will realize it was all worth it.\n\nI have recently promoted myself to using Av/Tv mode and took picture at very less light, without flash.

I can honestly say that the only photos that haven't come out the way I wanted them to were purely my fault.\n\nGave it 4 stars for 2 reasons.\n\n1. I am used to changing the focus from Single to Servo using a dial. Since I change this setting a lot I do not really like having to push buttons to do this.\n\n2. They have made this camera a lot smaller than the 'traditional' Canon SLR. Mostly in the width...I did prefer the larger body size personally.\n\n3. Having to push buttons to change the focus point really does annoy your subjects for portrait shots.

So now jumped back into SLR's with the Digital Rebel XT, what a great camera, easy to use for anyone who has used any EOS before, quick as you can basically turn it on and shoot, extremely light, maybe a little too light but still great for most uses. Must admit the kit lens feels a little on the flimsy side but as I splahed out on some other lenses this should not be a big issue.\n\nThe pictures and I must say the software that comes with the camera have proven to be great, great clarity, good colour reproduction and easy to play witht he photos on my PC anyway.\n\nAll in all a great deal of performance for the money."},{"reviewerName":"Eagle Cowboy","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Love this camera","reviewDate":"March 6, 2008","reviewText":"Great product at a good price.

I have been snapping photos every day with my XT. Today, at my daughter's birthday party, no less, the camera died without warning. I took a few shots, turned it off as carefully as ever, and set it on the table. When I tried to turn it back on a few minutes later, it wouldn't work. No LCD, wouldn't turn on. NOTHING! I assumed it was the battery. Took the battery home, charged it, and it still doesn't work. Since the company's policy is 15 days to return an opened item, and I've had the camera for 20 days, I am wating to hear about any exceptions to the returns policy, or whether Amazon will step in somehow and do what is right. I am sick over this. Did I just throw $600 out the window, or will Canon, Vann's (the independent company) and Amazon do what is right.\n\nRead other 1 & 2 star reviews. The same thing seems to have happened to others as well. Perhaps these cameras have a fatal flaw. I am discouraged, disappointed and disheartened. Buyer Beware!\n\nWill update!\n\nUPDATE - 6 months later:\nWith Amazon's help, I was able to get another XT instead. (Why should I have to send a 20-day-old camera for repairs?!?)

W.","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"The best thing I've ever bought","reviewDate":"March 23, 2005","reviewText":"The XT is amazing. The battery comes partly charged so you can immedietly start using the camera (thank you Canon!) I've already shot about 200 pictures with it and the battery hasn't died yet.\n\nI can't give you a comparison between the XT and the 20D as I haven't owned a 20D, I can tell you a few things you may wish to know before buying.\n\nThis camera, is TINY. Extremely tiny. I'm a woman in my early twenties and I have small hands. The camera fits just right in my hands, but honestly, I don't see how someone with bigger hands would be 100% comfortable holding this. If my hands were any larger, they would be slipping off the bottom.\n\nI had tried holding a 20D at a camera shop once and it felt too large in my hands to grip. The camera size is perfect for me, but just beware if you have larger hands. You may want to look into the battery grip, or test out holding the camera at a store before you order it. See the picture I uploaded above to get a size relation and how the camera fits in my hands.\n\nFor anyone who is migrating to this camera from a standard point and shoot digital camera, you cannot frame the image you are about to take using the LCD screen on the back. You must look through the viewfinder. The LCD screen is soley for menu use and preview mode after the picture has been taken, nothing more.\n\nSomething I've noticed is the camera makes a ratteling sound when moved around. I couldn't figure out what the heck it was, and then I finally reazlized it's the hinges from the pop-up flash. It sounds like they are loose when the flash is closed. I went to Best Buy and looked at their display model, and yep, it has the same problem. Well, it's not really a *problem* but frankly something ratteling around like that sounds cheaply made to me. My Canon film SLR doesn't make that sound.\n\nI use a 420EX Speedlite flash with my SLRs so the popup flash doesn't concern me, but it was something I noticed and thought I would share.\n\nI love that Canon gave the option to have a black finish over a silver one.\n\nThe startup time is instantaneous which is absolutely wonderful.\n\nThe burst mode is excellent with 3 fps.\n\nIt's extremely quiet.\n\nThe image quality is excellent. You can get photo quality prints at 20x30, and even then I bet you could push it further.\n\nI really can't elaborate more then what other reviews have said. If you are looking for a step into the digital SLR world, this is the ticket. Or you can even check out the newly reduced original Digital Rebel, but for the extra hundred bucks or so, I would just get the XT. You will not be sorry.\n\nTwo upgrades I would make right away: Get a Speedlite flash and the Canon 28-135mm lens.\n\nAlso, I don't know why people are submitting bad reviews grading Amazon on shipping for the Rebel XT. When I preordered the XT from Amazon (not from another 3rd party), it said it would be released March 20th. I got my Rebel XT in the mail yesterday (the 22nd) which if you ask me, is pretty darn good. Want something right away? Then walk into a store and buy it instead of ordering from the internet."},{"reviewerName":"L. A.

This is my first SLR. It is really good and I like it and I am glad to have it! I was really suprised how light is it! If you hold it in your hands.. it just fit really good! I use 1gb flash card II and I can fit about 262 pictures on standart Large size and 118 in RAW format. Thats, I think, pretty good. Camera is really quick. I like the flash (you can change the flash exposure) I like the parameters and b&w filters. You also can change the white balance in many different ways. AF mode and metering mode is good too! In automatic modes everything works properly.\n\nOne night it was snowing and I wanted to take some pictures at night about treets with snow on but it didn't let me take picture because of snowing...\n\nIt is lot of work to set everything correctly but if you know how the picture look really pretty!!! I am also fine with the battery. Some reviewers criticises it but I like it. I was taking lot of pictures outside all day (without flash) and my battery is still ok.. so I can not say anything bad. The thing I don't like the most is the strap. It is cheap and non comfortable! I also bought the EH18 case for this camera but I am very disapointed, such as I wrote in the review about it. It is really complicated to put the camera out of the case and then after that you have to put the case somewhere because it doesn't have any strap. Also the front lens cap. You have to put it somewhere because it is not connected to the camera by any string or something.\n\nI am really enjoying this SLR. Now I need other accesories... I would love the 17-88 zoom lens but is expensive!\n\nThe price of this camera is ok. I found it today $50 cheaper then I payed but it is ok. Also tripod and better case is needed.\n\nIn the end, I really like this brand New Digital Rebel XT SLR!"},{"reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Five Stars","reviewDate":"March 16, 2017","reviewText":"Nice!!"},{"reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"One Star","reviewDate":"May 21, 2017","reviewText":"scam"},{"reviewerName":"Eileen Pitts","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"One Star","reviewDate":"June 27, 2014","reviewText":"Mailed it to someone else."},{"reviewerName":"T.P.","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Excellent Camera","reviewDate":"November 25, 2005","reviewText":"This is a very good DSRL camera for the price.

I'd purchased its 35mm film-based cousin last month and when my wife's Minolta point-and-shoot started acting up, I figured it was time for an upgrade; and since most of my former camera work was done with 35mm SLRs with real glass lenses, I opted for something that looked familiar. Only after I bought the Rebel did I find out that it was a fairly well-rated camera.\n\nTwo things that caught me off guard: 1) it doesn't come with a memory card, and 2) it doesn't support video recording. Neither of these are deal breakers, but for a $500 camera a $1 memory card should have been in included. And the non-video capture ability just surprises me as I see this feature in lower priced units.\n\nI'll update this review after spending some time using the camera."},{"reviewerName":"Larry L.

Make sure you do your homework and don't be drawn into something you can't easily undo (even if you're close to NY city they won't provide a real address). Likewise if you used, as I did, a search to find vendors outside Amazon.\n\nMy suggestion is to get into Google and look up as much info as you can on a potential storefront or even a user. Last night I was considering buying from the one offering a Canon 20D for about $750! After checking them out, I discovered multiple complaints and nothing that indicated they were a legitimiate enterprise.\n\nAlthough I was torn between the XT and the 20D, I decided to place an order with Amazon for the XT. Now, I notice a post that says his delivery date for this item from Amazon is 2 months out! My order was immediately 'processed' so I can't change it, but you can bet I will do whatever it takes if I have to wait that long. The 20D was available for immediate shipment, so I may regret not ordering it.\n\nI'll update this post to share how this works out...\n\nSince my original post, I have sent Amazon 2 messages to try to cancel my Rebel XT order (and then order the 20D). I have heard nothing back in 2 days. Note that the Amazon order page for this item says 'you can cancel your order at any time'. Not true, as mine says it's being processed and no changes can be made. Yet, it has not actually shipped nor do I expect it to anytime soon. Ad also says 'first come, first served' 'as soon as it's available'. So why not let me change my order rather than place it in limbo where I now am stuck with whatever date they decide to ship it? Not good customer relations!\n\nAlthough I'm a big advocate of Amazon, I feel I'm getting screwed on this transaction. Hope someone is reading this as well as the 2 inquiries I have made...\n\nIt's now Friday - 3 days since my order was locked in - and to my surprise the camera has just been shipped!!! I never received a reply to my customer service inquiries, so I'll now have to be content with this purchase. I'm sure this will be a great product but I'm still a bit miffed about the lack of flexibility in changing the order. The morale is to be sure you're absolutely sure about what you want before hitting the 'place order' button."},{"reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Five Stars","reviewDate":"January 11, 2017","reviewText":"Everything worked fine.. exactly as described"},{"reviewerName":"tia","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"digital camera","reviewDate":"February 17, 2014","reviewText":"black paint damaged but still good...works well could have a camera bag though...great job...helps me take great pictures for my college class"},{"reviewerName":"Timothy J.

I had been using point-and-shoot's for years and I wanted to get into amateur photography. I had considered older Canon and Nikon models such as the D70 but ultimately I went for the Canon because of the lower price. I bought it with a 28-80mm lens and some basic accessories.\n\nFirst off, the camera is LIGHT. That could be a good or bad thing, depending on your experience holding dSLRs and the size of your hands. Some people have mentioned the rattling sound the pop-up flash makes, and I warn you it is present. That being said, I have zero gripes about the build quality and durability of this camera. It has survived countless drops, the worst outcome being merely a few scratches. It's build should be sufficient for almost everybody. If you want a more solid-feeling camera, get the 20D, a Nikon, or buy a battery grip.\n\nI like both the silver and black models, although I went for the black, both models are identical. The black looks more like a typical dSLR, and the silver, while may looking cheap to some, nonetheless looks unique and provides a neat color contrasts to your accessories.\n\nThe interface on this camera is straightforward, and previous Canon users will recognize its familiar mode dial and status bar above the LCD screen. It has a good setup of features that. Both autofocus and manual focus work perfectly as expected. Just a reminder for people still using point-and-shoot cameras, you cannot preview your pictures using the LCD screen. The knobs for adjusting shutter speed and aperture are easily acceptable, and there are no complaints on the grip and feel of the camera.\n\nPicture quality is excellent, whether shooting RAW or JPEG. Its 8 Megapixels should satisfy all but the pickiest detail photographers and the people using their cameras to print out large images. The detail is great, focus for single-shot images is consistent. The camera takes great pictures in nearly any environment, and its 3 frames per second burst shot is pretty good as well. Settings for both manual and auto modes should satisfy most, beginners can chose auto and shoot away while pros have plenty of settings to fiddle through. Noise isn't much of a problem, although the ISO range only goes to 1600. The flash is only average, but the rattling seems to bother me more than the risk of overexposure.\n\nOne minor problem I note is the autofocus for the continuous shots. While taking continuous shots on auto (burst mode, servo AF) the camera doesn't always focus in on the subject; pictures are occasionally blurry and other times it will focus on the wrong thing. I blame this on the age of the sensor. If you want to take many frames per second for moving targets (sports, etc.) you might want to consider a newer camera with more autofocus points.\n\nThe software is easy to use, it works with no issue on either Windows or Mac OSX.\n\nThe startup and write times are speedy: it starts up almost instantly and writing times are immediate (except when taking several frames). I consider this a major upgrade to older dSLRs.\n\nThe battery life is good, nothing to brag about but it should last you a week on little usage or 3 days of continuous shooting.\n\nNote the LCD is very small for a dSLR. It's still very functional, however I find myself squinting to see it in sunlight.\n\nThere is no video or 'movie' feature on this camera. It's all about the pictures here :)\n\nSo my few final complaints are (in order): rattling noise caused by flash mounts, continuous autofocus, and LCD screen size and brightness.\n\nIs it still a good buy in 2014? Should I consider a newer camera considering its age (2005)? Will it satisfy beginners to photography who are on a tight budget?\n\nHere's the answer: as far as buys go, this could be among the best buys for an entry-level dSLR around. For what you get in image quality and flexibility, it is certainly still up for the task for photography. Newer cameras may have blings such as 1080p video, larger displays and more intuitive controls, and more megapixels, but this Canon EOS 350D is a good example of what the heart of beginner and amateur photography should be. If you just want to takes pictures, good pictures, by all means go for it. This isn't a professional camera that shoots in 10 frames per second, and this isn't a camera with 20 megapixels and a 4 inch display.

I have had all types of cameras over the years, mostly 35mm film Canon slr's. I too bought all sorts of these 5-7 MP point and shoot digital cameras before returning to my true love, SLR's. I have had my digital Canon Rebel XT about a month now and I can't keep my hands off of it. It lacks nothing. Although the kit lense is good, I bought a 28-135 Canon zoom lense with image stabilizion and have produced stunning photo's with it. I love the way you can use the 7 points to focus, I mainly use only the center point with focus lock and never get an out of focus picture. I guess the nicest thing for me is that I now don't have the urge to buy every point and shoot camera that is paraded out on QVC or HSN that has a \"wonderful\" new feature like \"low light or non-shake.\" This Canon has every good feature in the known universe and you can't outgrow it. Its a camera that will let you be as good as you can be, it won't hold you back. The battery life is great, the built in flash is good but I bought a 430EX and that's even better. I never figure I'm wasting money buying accessories for this camera as it will be my main squeeze for many years to come. I always missed my 35mm Canon slr's and now feel that I have an old friend back again, only much much better.

Don't listen to those pro/photosnubs who lambast this very powerful camera. Don't feel envy or inferior than this camera's \"bigger\" sister (the D20) because it offers, by far, pretty much the same specs. This camera feels solid, very easy to handle and get around of. The plethora of Canon lenses you can attach to this camera is big enough to let your imagination do its work (limited only by the depth of your pockets).\n\n*Image quality is bar-none.\n\n*Noise @ relatively high ISOs (400-800) is negligible.\n\n*Battery life is decent (buy an additional battery).\n\n*The auto focus is blazing fast (with canon lenses).\n\n*Start-up time is unreal!\n\n*Menus and configuration settings of the camera are well thought-out and designed.\n\n*Very versatile; in fact, extremelly versatile. Just as it can work for those new to SLRs, it can work for advanced amateurs and semi-pro photographers as well.\n\nThings you need to (must) do and buy to make the most of this camera:\n\n* Ditch the kit lens...leave it as a \"just-in-case-of-doomsday\" lens.\n\n* Buy at least 2 more lenses one for wide-angle shots and one tele-foto (zoom). I recommend buying Canon's as they perform the best with their cameras (though if you're on a tight budget, you can get Sigma's).\n\n* Tripod.\n\n* External Flash (if you plan to use it in less-than-ideal light conditions).\n\n* Carrying case.\n\n* Filters.\n\n* Insurance!!!\n\nYes, I know that buying all of the above will set you back $1700-2K (camera inclusive), but in this field is more true than anywhere else, \"you get what you pay for.\"\n\nIf your hands are big and don't feel very comfortable with this camera, you might then try a D20 (or buy the external battery grip for the Rebebel XT).\n\nIn short, very good camera, good price, good upgrade options, and reliable service from Canon.

Here's the list of problems I found based on my use:\n\n1. The sensor gets dirty easily (I do switch lenses often, never in any dusty environment though), and hard to clean.\n\n2. Shutter button becomes sticky just now, won't release once pressed sometimes.\n\n3. View finder is small and hard to manual focus in regular day light, impossible in dim in door setting for me.\n\n4. The menu has most of the things I need, but not quick to get to during shooting. I have to give up so many good opportunities just to adjust the settings: focus (single point to muli-point), white balance. Yes, the custom white balance works great. But I didn't realize I have to rely on it in most of the in door settings. Auto WB fails in door most of the time with strong color bias without flash. When different rooms have different lighting condition, I have to set each one up before I can make my shots. And it ain't easy or quick. This is the pain in the ... Tried Olympus Evolt E500 and the auto white balance on it was worse. Maybe this is an inheritant DSLR problem because of the current limitation of the sensor technology?\n\n5. The building flash is kinda weak, but the recycle is fast. The external flash just is too big and slow. Wish Canon will make the new ones more powerful in the future.\n\n6. The camera's software gives me errors from time to time, regardless which lenses I use, Canon or Sigma. Pull the battery and restart usually solves the problem. But at one time, it went totally crazy, none of the lenses I have can auto focus. I ended up reinstall the firmware and it solved the problem.\n\nI am going to send it back for service, and hope things will get better after that.\n\nAll in all, this really is an entry level DSLR, something supposed to be a lot more expensive. Canon managed to make it affordable for us mortals with a catch. I think I'll move to the 30D line when it comes out with auto sensor cleaning. The full frame is great (better view finder and faster AF, among other things), but it places too much pressure on the lenses. I just can't afford the right lenses for the full frame. Haven't heard any rumors on 40D yet. The new 400D XTi supposes to have better AF and sensor cleaning. But I am far more cautious about the Rebel line in general now. Perhaps Canon made too many comprimises to make this line affordable.\n\nBy the way, I took over 80,000 pictures with this camera in less than a year. So I real used it.\n\n--------------------------------\nUpdate Sept 2008\n\nFinally updated to 40D, right before 50D was announced, thanks alot Canon :) AF is so much better on the 40D! But everything else is still the same, except there are more buttons so I can have better control more easily, most of the time. AWB still sucks, so I shoot RAW these days. Just take much much more time for the home work afterwards. But I wouldn't blame 350D for its limitations. Because no matter which way you cut it, it's in a different world from any point and shoot, even with the humble kit lens. For those who want to have something to shoot their small kids, go get an entry level DSLR like this one, or maybe a Nikon if you haven't already got so many EF/EFS lenses like myself. With those point and shoot, you have missed way more great shots than you realized. I only got mine when my slow little Olympus died on me. Then I discovered DSLR. But by that time my daughter is already 1 year old! Get it before the baby comes out and do some practice before the big bang.

I have never had any problems with this camera and it has performed amazingly. I have taken around 50,000 pictures with my Rebel and it is still going strong. I have the same original batteries that I got with my camera. My batteries have always lasted a long time before needing to be recharged; when I shot sports I could use one battery for roughly the whole day. Canon products are very high quality, which is what you can expect with brand name Japanese electronics. The Canon lenses are also fantastic; I have owned the high-quality standard 50/1.4, the portrait 85/1.8, the mid telephoto 70-200/4.0, the amazing 100/2.8 macro,and the wide-angle 17-40 L. These are all fantastic lenses to put on your Rebel, and you can rest assured that there is a whole range of Canon products to suit your needs. The only downside to these products is that they are quite expensive.\n\nAs far as the Rebel, the only complaints I have are these:\n\n1. The amount of noise at 1600 ISO makes these pictures generally unusable.\n2. The AF system is not robust enough for sports; you can do it but it's hard.\n3. The grip, somewhat small, can take getting used to.\n4. The camera can't take too many RAW or high quality JPEG pictures in succession (important for sports).\n\nIn general this camera is a dream for most peoples uses. Eight MP will give you high-quality prints.

Buy the body only!","reviewDate":"May 27, 2007","reviewText":"Great camera. It is sold as a non-professional grade DSLR but I have sold pictures taken with it professionally, as I'm sure countless others have as well. I don't think I need to be the 999th person to wax poetic about it, so I won't go any further. There are plenty of other well-written reviews detailing the good points in better ways than I can.\n\nI did want to write this review, however, as a cautionary tale against buying this crappy kit lens. Please just buy the body only and get a decent lens separately! I sure wish I had.\n\nAgain, I am talking only about the kit lens here: horrible in low-light, horrible in too much light. Here's the biggest issue, however: porous construction allows dust inside. I kid you not, day one of owning it after cleaning it with a lint free cloth, there were about 20-30 little dust particles visible ON THE INSIDE! No way to get them out, either. I tried blowing on it with a compressed air can (just to hopefully move them to the sides and out of the middle) but all it did was move them around. How is this lens so porous right out of the box? If the dust was already there out of the box and I just didn't notice it, that would be just as bad if you ask me. Of course there is no way to open it without sending it off, which would cost more than the lens is worth. I will say the dust was so tiny that I never saw any interference in the picture output, but just knowing it is there is enough to drive a perfectionist like me CRAZY. Sidebar: I don't imagine many people who are purchasing DSLR cameras for several hundred dollars are not perfectionists, but I digress.\n\nAnyway, again great camera just don't get this worthless kit lens. Spend a couple of hundred extra and get a decent USM lens. If there one more issue to mention, it would be that the built-in flash is laughable. I don't know why they even bother putting it there. It should be used in case of emergency only! If you are planning on shooting indoors you must get a flash. Not you should get a flash, you must. The built-in flash is a joke. that being said, this is the case with every digital SLR camera I know of."},{"reviewerName":"Brian Groover","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Outstanding Quality and Versatility","reviewDate":"August 16, 2005","reviewText":"I've had my Digital Rebel XT for several months now, I've taken over ten thousand pictures with it, and it is without question the most versatile camera I've ever owned. It is also one of the easiest to use. With a simple turn of the dial, you can put it in point-and-shoot mode, specialized automatic modes for various situations, or any of the \"artistic\" modes, including fully manual.\n\nYou'll want to shoot using the higher-end modes, because you can save your pictures in RAW format, allowing you to fix errors afterwards that cannot be corrected in a jpg.\n\nIf you can afford it, get this camera body only, and skip the kit lens. Instead, fork over the $600 for the 17-85mm IS lens by Canon. The Image Stabilization is well worth it, and the lens is versatile enough that you don't have to change lenses at all for most shooting. Although I've not had any problems with dust, this is supposedly a weak spot for digital cameras, and not having to change lenses is a major plus. (In fact, the only other lens I use on this camera right now is a 600-1300mm zoom.) The camera's computer will automatically balance the lens IS feature in both automatic and \"artistic\" shooting.\n\nI also got the Canon speedlight 580 with this camera, and the camera's computer also accurately balances with the flash, syncing at up to 1/200th, I think. Outstanding.\n\nThe only thing I wish this camera had that it doesn't was 1/8000th of a second. There have been some bright daylight shots in which I didn't have time to get the shot in, because 1/4000th wasn't enough, and the shot was gone before I could adjust everything to it. Shooting in RAW, however, I was able to correct most of it afterwards.\n\nI did lose some pictures by snapping the shot right before turning the camera off. If you do that, you will lose the shot. (It only takes about a second to save a shot, so you just have to not turn it off instantly after the shot.)\n\nAll in all, I could not be happier with this camera. I've used it to shoot baseball and softball, both portraits and action, including action close-ups with a long zoom and both a tripod and monopod, several thousand wildlife shots, mostly with a long lens, several hundred outdoor scenery shots, and several thousand candids. It hasn't faltered once, and it has performed perfectly.\n\nAlthough it is easy to use right out of the box, it is WELL worth reading the manual."},{"reviewerName":"Brian M.

Though Canon has rapidly expanded its entry-level EOS line, this is still a great camera to seek out as its price is falling pretty rapidly.\n\nThe obvious downside to buying this camera is that its screen is much smaller than just about any LCD screen currently on the market. Its a good screen, though, and be sure to check your histograms regardless of camera.\n\n8MP is a fine pixel count, there is more to a good picture than the the number of pixels on the sensor, and if you shoot in raw you will be able to get decent sized prints, if you print at all (I rarely do). Even the \"large JPEG\" mode is great for smaller prints like 4x6/5x7 prints.\n\nWhat this camera's low price allows you to do is spend more money to get the good lenses and other equipment that you will use well beyond the life of one camera (hopefully). Yes, the APS-C sized sensor creates that 'crop factor' but it is workable and there is a wide range of compatible lenses designed for Canon's EOS line. In addition, I would recommend picking up the 430EX flash, as your indoor photography will greatly improve with something better than the pop-up flash.\n\nI have been very satisfied with the results and it is a great way to get started in DSLR photography, which is a different experience from point and shoot cameras.

This is not necessarily true especially when using a cheaper lens (ie the kit lens) compared to a great point and shoot cameras such as the canon SD700, fuji f31fd, olympus C-7000 or panasonic DMC-FZ5. I found a better lens than the bundled 18-55mm kit lens that sells very cheaply (especially used), the canon ef 28-80mm 1:3.5-5.6 which results in more realistic color and brightness especially in automatic mode. A good point and shoot is much more practical for carrying around and really does as good a job for image quality under most situations and better in some others (such as photographing objects at different distances simultaneously and trying to keep all in focus). The real advantages of this camera over a point and shoot are that almost every conceivable setiing can be changed manually; the availablility of so many lenses (though the really good ones are very expensive); the feel of a professional camera and much better flash range. I believe that most people that buy this camera will also own (and use) a small point and shoot camera. If you have no desire to use manual settings, consider this purchase carefully.

Other Canon cameras I own include the Canon EOS 10S, the EOS Rebel G2, the EOS Elan 7, the EOS Rebel digital (6.3 MP) and now the EOS Rebel Digital XT.\n\nCanon products keep getting better and better and less expensive. I used to be a big Minolta fan, but then Minolta did its swan dance and I got stuck with a couple of Minolta bodies and a bunch of Minolta lenses that were no longer supported. That will never happen with a Canon camera.\n\nBut back to the Rebel XT. This camera has all the wonderful features that made the first EOS Rebel digital such a big hit and then improves upon them. The obvious improvements are a smaller and lighter body as well as a bigger sensor (6.3 vs. 8.0 mp). The other not so obvious improvements include much faster response time (I can't tell you how many shots I previously lost due to lag time) and a new accessory battery grip that takes rechargeable batteries as well as AA batteries. While traveling is not always feasible to bring a charger along, so the ability to use standard and readily available AA bettereis is a major plus.\n\nThis camera is a true joy to use. I passed up on the XTi (like I passed up on the Elan 7E) because I do not need or want some of the extra complexities of the XTi model. I don't need eye focusing (Elan 7E) and I don't need a CMOS self-cleaner (Rebel XTi). It is not all that hard to occassionaly clean out the old CMOS.\n\nIf this is your first digital SLR camera you will like the point-and-shoot auto modes found in the camera. If you are a more advanced user you will benefit from all the shooting choices available with the camera. In other words, this is a camera that you can grow with and will not soon outgrow.\n\nIf you already own Canon, or Canon-mount lenses, then buy the body only and skip the kit. If this is your first SLR, get the kit and learn your way around the camera using the lens included with the kit.

I'm partial to an eclectic review I wrote on my blog -- if you want to read it Google on [Gordon's Tech Digital Rebel XT review] and you'll find it. (Amazon does not allow one to put URLs in a review).\n\nI won't repeat the full review here; instead I'll focus on ... getting sharp images. The negative reviews on Amazon complain about out-of-focus images. I think I can help.\n\nIf you've used a consumer digital camera with a tiny CCD sensor, you've gotten used to great depth of field. The APS-sized (2x3 aspect ratio btw, not 3x4!) sensor on this camera is big enough that depth of field is back. When I use my 50mm Canon 1.8 (equivalent of 80mm on 35mm camera) the depth of focus is inches. That's not much to work with.\n\nAlso, the 'smart' 8 point focus tends to fail for me. I got much better results when I switched to a single focus point and started using focus lock.\n\nLastly, the default built-in flash settings favors an odd combination of flash and long exposures (so one gets the background exposed) along with wide open lens and ISO 400 sensitivity (to reduce power drain?). Bad choices for most of us.\n\nYou can fix the flash behavior. Read the manual carefully, there's an esoteric setting that fixes the shutter speed to 1/200 sec with Av flash pictures. Use that setting and use Aperture priority for flash images, set your lens to f 4 or better, ISO to 200 and you can expect sharp flash pictures.\n\nI think this is a solid camera, despite the annoying rattle in the flash unit \"arms\". I think we'll eventually move beyond SLR technology, but for now the power consumption of these larger more light efficient sensors requires that they be embedded in an SLR body."},{"reviewerName":"JM","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great Beginner's SLR","reviewDate":"November 20, 2011","reviewText":"Overall, this is a great camera, never had a problem with it. This was my first true SLR, and I've taken it many places and taken many pictures with it while learning how to really take pictures versus just pointing and shooting. I will admit that I haven't become familiar shooting with any other SLRs and I don't have much to compare it to, but with that in mind, it's a great camera. If you are looking to become more serious about your photography and want to concentrate on shutter speed, aperture, manual mode, anything besides switching it to auto and shooting away then this is perfect (although you can still put it in auto.) You can swap out the lenses, and it has many shooting modes and options. It's an older camera, and my smart phone has more megapixels than this camera. That being said, this camera still has a good processor and all of the other internal parts to make these shots ten times better than anything that would come from even the best cell phone. The only reason I'm even considering upgrading to the T3 is because the xT does not have live view, has a smaller display, uses a CF card, doesn't shoot HD video and has less focus zones and less megapixels. The only reason I haven't switched is because the quality on this still very good and I haven't had any problems with this camera, so I can't justify spending the money right now. My recommendation? Some reasons to get this camera are if you have never owned an SLR before, if you're on a lower budget, you want a nice camera but know you'll never use it except for Christmas morning and whatever graduations and family barbecues you have each year, and/or you are a new photographer. Reasons you might not want to get this are if you can't live without live view (seeing what your camera sees on the screen almost like a video), if you have a need to take videos with your camera, and/or if you're you're not a beginner and you're willing to put a little more money into it.

Also: Comparison b/w NIKON D70 and Rebel XT.","reviewDate":"January 19, 2006","reviewText":"I've been using this camera for a few months now and I can't say anything but praise. I've transitioned from using point and shoot cameras to the SLR. I just can't believe the difference. The quality of the photos is truly amazing.\n\nI was actually debating between the Nikon D70 and the XT. I had been preferring the D70 b/c of the \"better\" kit lens. But I actually went to Best Buy and took pictures with both cameras, side by side, at different settings including full auto. I then printed out prints to compare the two. The XT was ablt to pick up small shows and detail in the back of the store that the D70 just showed as a blur. All different settings looked better with the XT. The pictures were much, much clearer and crisper and the color was much more like actual colors in the store. Also, the D70 wasn't as easy to use as the XT. The menus were not as clear as the XT. Needless to say, I stopped looking into the D70.\n\nNow, over 7500 photos later, I'm totally happy with my choice. I have actually zoomed in on portraits using my desktop and was able to see the tear ducts in my daughter's eyes. The camera is also simple enough for my wife to take great photos.\n\nPros: 3 pics per second - super fast. Great price for a dig SLR. Easy to use menus. Great indoor photos. Battery charges in less than 2 hrs and lasts forever. Many great Canon lenses to choose from. Manual and auto focus lens is great. Great clarity photos. 8 megapixal is awesome. Prints great 8x10's. (I also just got the Canon MP500 printer AIO. Only 150 w/ free S/H)\n\nCons: only uses CF media (and doesn't come w/ a card) - I like CF though b/c you can buy the larger CF type 2 cards - I got the 6GB card - can take about 1500 pics on highest quality. SD or other types of media are more limited on size of cards.\n\nOverall - GREAT Camera. I totally recommend for regular home use or professional use. Great price. Can't go wrong with this one."},{"reviewerName":"M2","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Canon Kiss Digital N (Digital Rebel XT)","reviewDate":"April 18, 2005","reviewText":"I'm stationed overseas so most companies won't let me buy cool electronics like the Digital Rebel XT so I went out on the Japanese economy. This is my first digital SLR. I've struggled trying to capture great shots of my daughters playing soccer, basketball, running track..etc., with the \"enthusiast\" zoom cameras. The Kiss Digital N is made in Japan and has a few minor differences from the U.S. model. The kit zoom 18-55 lens for instance is USM. I bought it as a kit with another Canon lens as well, a 55-200 EF. It's light, cheap, and good enough as I'll get to in a minute. In the end it was between the Pentax istDS or the Digital Rebel XT. After completing all of my research on-line it came down to Canon picture quality, and technology. Am I happy? So far this camera is light years ahead of any digital that I've owned. It's fast, the pictures are sharp if you understand the limitations of the lens you are using, and it's easy. My wife can use it just fine and she doesn't have a digital clue. For the enthusiast, there is plenty of stuff to play with. The 8 megapixel CMOS sensor produces amazing results. The soccer pics tell the story for me. The 55-200 EF produced some incredible shots. It's USM and focuses fast and sharp. It's not an \"L\" lens but I don't even know what that means! This camera will sell like crazy. Eventually I plan on buying a 35mm EF prime F2.0 lens, the wireless remote, the battery grip, and Canon Flash.

I've used a T90 since they were introduced in 1986, added a Hasselblad in 1999 for landscapes and a Sony point and shoot in 2002 for \"walking around\".\n\nI found I was using the Sony for all our holiday and travel shots, and the Hasselblad just for my recreational landscapes, the T90 not at all. I began to want the creative control I had with 35mm but with the convenience of digital, and decided that a DSLR was the answer.\n\nHere's how I use my Rebel XT:\n\nWith a 24mm EOS as the ultimate \"carry around\" camera, it's very compact and light, has outstanding battery life and gets plenty of shots on a 1Gig card. Perfect for \"point and click\" type shooting.\n\nSwitch to the outstanding 17-40 f4L and add the battery grip for more \"serious\" out and about shooting. This is my typical vacation configuration. The battery grip provides a very comfortable holding position, and I can probably manage over 1,000 shots without recharging when using two batteries. The 17-40 f4L is a beautiful lens with outstanding color rendition and resolving power, it also has very good environmental seals that keep moisture out of the lens and the body. I've had the surface of an umbrella in Scotland dumped on the camera in this configuration and it survived fine.\n\nFor motorsports photography I use the 70-200 f4L and a monopod. I've had prints made at 24\"x36\" from these sessions that are simply stunning.\n\nFor closeups I use a set of fully automatic tubes and a 50mm 1.8, a great lens for very little money.\n\nObservations:\n\nBe prepared to do more work in post-processing than with a point and shoot, the Rebel XT does not pump up the colors or sharpening as much in camera as the strictly \"consumer\" cameras - but used properly the results can be much better.\n\nControl focus points yourself. I think many focus problems stem either from not noticing that the camera has picked the wrong point for you, or not paying attention to the aperture picked if using one of the more \"programmed\" modes. I use Speed priority or Aperture priority only, just as I always did with the T90. I tend to configure auto focus so that only the centre sensor is used and use focus hold to pick the spot and then re-frame. I initially had some disappointing results until I took more control of the process myself.\n\nAbove all enjoy!"},{"reviewerName":"Adam Hedrick","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"A Year Review","reviewDate":"December 30, 2006","reviewText":"Well, it has been a year since I recieved my Rebel XT and I am more than pleased with the camera. The build quality, features, and photo quality have made this camera a joy to own and use.\n\nWhen I first decided to move from film to digital, I began the long and tedious process of researching all the cameras on the market at the time. I had previously owned many Canon film cameras and compact digital cameras, so they were of course my first choice. I looked at Nikon, Olympus, Canon, and Konica(now Sony) dSLR's.\n\nThe Canon came out on top in all catergories with the exception of a few at the time, such as price because of the Nikon D50, though the Rebel's other features clearly outway the Nikon. Overall, the Canon is just a superior camera, so hopefully, that saves you the trouble of spending nearly a month researching.\n\nAlright, so how is that camera? It is wonderful. It fits well in my hands and everything is where it should be. It does feel a little light, but it is made to be compact and light, plus that can easily be remidied by adding a battery grip. All of it's settings and features are virtually identical to the more expensive 20D, as is the image quality. There is a good amount of grain at ISO 1600, which is really a shame, but that can generally be fixed in an image editing program or by using a flash. The battery life is very good, but I do reccomend purchasing that battery grip that I mentioned before. Not only does it add weight and balance the camera, but it also doubles the battery life, which is good for those of us who go out and take thousands of pictures.\n\nThis is just a wonderful camera for the prosumer crowd, and there is no reason that it cannot be used as a pro camera for creating prints and such. I would recomend this to anyone looking to break into photography or someone who has been photographing for 30 years.\n\nMy recomendations:\n- Get a few extra batteries and a battery grip. Remember, you don't have to buy a Canon grip or batteries, and if you don't, you'll probably save at least 50%. Do some research on here. The Opteka grip is great, it is what I own, and you can find a huge number of batteries, just pick own with a good review.\n- Sigma lenses are generally in expensive, take great shots, and are durable. Some Canon lenses will have better optics, but will cost at least twice as much.\n- Get the Canon 50mm f/1.8. It is a very inexpensive lens(about $60 - $70) and takes amazing shots.\n- Big memory cards are amazing. Buy one, seriously. I have a 6GB card and shoot in RAW, so I get about 650 pictures. JPG will get 2000. I need another one because I shoot so much.\n- External hard drives are a must for all those big files. I have a 250GB Phantom Drive, and I reccomend that, but there are now many cheaper alternatives.\n- Don't forget a tripod and/or a monopod, a flash(though it does have one, external flashes are much better), and filters if you want to experiment.\n\nHope you enjoy your camera as much as I have!"},{"reviewerName":"Jared","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"LOVE my Rebel XT","reviewDate":"July 4, 2007","reviewText":"I have taken some gorgeous pictures with this camera and I know nothing about photography.

Near instantanous start up, and can shoot 3 shots/second. I purchased a 1 GB Sandisk high speed CF card to make sure the speed kept up.\n\nCanon's website has an extensive tuitoral about the Rebel, and from it I have found that Aperture priority (AV) mode works best in most situations.

I had tried some others, but I really liked, and still like, the way this camera feels. The image quality is excellent, the kit lens that comes with the camera is certainly better than most people lead you to believe, and the speed is fantastic, in both start up and burst.\n\nIt's hard to say what the one best feature of this camera is because there really are more \"best\" features than one. Like I said, I really like the weight and feel of the camera. I believe it's still the lightest digital SLR on the market. Some have complained that it's too small. I disagree. For me, this camera fits me very well.\n\nThe start up speed is very good, if not excellent. Once I turn on the camera, it's ready to shoot long before I am. The battery life is phenomenal. While I haven't recorded exactly how many shots can be taken on a battery charge, I can say that it's hundreds. I personally have never run out of battery. Of course, I purchased a second battery for back up and simply cycle between them after each long shoot.\n\nThe speed that the camera writes to CF is astonishing as well, as is the ability to take several pictures in a row. This comes in handy when shooting moving objects, as it's hard to get that \"one shot\" that makes the day worthwhile. As I said before, the image quality is brilliant. I shoot in RAW+JPG mode, and doing so doesn't appreciably slow down the camera or the writing of the files to the CF card and the clarity and trueness of the image really is captured in RAW.\n\nI cannot say enough about this camera. It is a steal at any advertised price."},{"reviewerName":"Matt","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"An entry level digital SLR that doesn't take entry level pictures!","reviewDate":"July 21, 2005","reviewText":"Perhaps the best quality of this camera is the image quality. Simply put, it is fantastic. In fact, I would go so far as to say that the quality of pictures taken with this camera equals that of the MUCH more expensive 20D. Image quality is also superior to the Nikon D70, both in terms of noise level and resolution (8MP vs 6.1MP). So while this camera may not have the metal body, substantial feel, and features of the above two cameras, it either equals or exceeds these two cameras in terms of image quality. And is image quality not perhaps the most important quality of a camera? I should also note that the Rebel XT is cheaper than EITHER of these cameras.\n\nOf course, this camera is not without some hitches. One is, of course, the lens. Many others have complained about this. Admittedly, it is not too bad in many situations. And perhaps I have not found all of its faults. But it has one SEVERE shortcoming I have painfully noticed - no numbers on the focusing ring. This is quite a problem if you like night photography. In such a situation, it is VERY hard to focus using the viewfinder. And an estimation of distance generally results in a better focus. Numbers would also make landscapes easier to focus on, as you often just go to infinity.\n\nSpeaking of night photography, another annoyance I have found is a few errant bright pixels in dark areas. This is a particular problem with high ISO and/or long exposure times. And the noise reduction does little to nothing to deal with this. However, I do not know that another digital camera would do better in this area. These sorts of artifacts could very well represent a shortcoming of digital technology (vs film) which has not yet been overcome.\n\nAnother issue is size. This camera is quite small. But this can be a good or bad thing. On one hand, it can make the camera more difficult to hold. But on the other hand, it makes it light and easy to carry with you. I guess it all boils down to what you are comfortable with.\n\nThe bottom line: despite any shortcomings, a GREAT choice for your first digital SLR. It's inexpensive. And it takes pictures that WON'T leave you wishing you had spent more."},{"reviewerName":"MD Boatbum","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"It refuses to die.","reviewDate":"March 23, 2007","reviewText":"I waited a while after purchasing this camera before posting a review, as I wanted to make sure I'd gotten to know it.

All the positive things that have been said are true so I'll spend my time with some ideas for those who are on the \"fence\" or who are not sure if a DSLR is for them.\n\nIf you are new to DSLRs and/or photography, this camera (and any dslr) takes more knowledge than a standard p&s camera. The biggest complaint I hear is it is not as sharp as my old P&S and the pictures are softer. DSLRs do not apply as much in camera sharpening so your images may not be as sharp straight from the camera (you can change that in the camera).\n\nBest results will always come if you do some post image processing (pp). If you do not like PP, this is a negative, however, you can set the in-camera options to apply pp to your liking. It is just better controlled in pp software.\n\nKnowledge of photographic concepts such as Depth of Field(dof) and exposure control are needed. People sometimes complain about the cameras soft images when in actuality it is user error due to the concept mistakes above.\n\nPlan to spend more money on lenses!!! The 18-55 is very good for the money ($80-$100 market) but is nowhere near the quality of other options that you have. Plan to spend more on at least 1-2 quality lenses for best results. There is really, really a noticeable difference.\n\nA few reasons I rated this camera 4 instead of 5: 1)The eyepiece view is a little smaller than other DSLRs.

My pictures almost always turn out perfect, and if they don't it's my fault due to still learning. I was also a little worried about the reviews that say so much has to be done in photo editing, but I don't find this to be the case. I spend only minutes on some pictures, and others I don't have to change anything, save for erasing some dust spots.\n\nMy only complaints are these; The view finder is very small... Being near-sighted, it makes it a very slow process for me at times to do manual focus, though I do it anyway. However after a day of shooting I find my eyes hurting from the strain. This is where the 20D or 30D win. I played with a 20D at the camera shop, and was so happy that it only took me a split second to do manual focus with it.\nAnd then there is the small LCD screen. I thought I lived with it on my point and shoot, I can live with it here, however I can't.

Higher resolution sensor, larger LCD with enhanced UI, and self image sensor cleaning system can be very beneficial to many as well."},{"reviewerName":"iheartBOOKs","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"If you don't know what you'r doing but want to learn...get the XT.","reviewDate":"May 28, 2010","reviewText":"With over 500 reviews what can I offer, not much, I just wanted to share my little experience.\n\nAfter I reluctantly handed over $60 to JCP for newborn pictures I decided to save money by investing in a good camera and taking my daughters monthly portraits myself.\n\nIt has been an exciting 5 year foray into photography with my little Rebel. I learned all the basics and have been off of manual mode for a couple of years and have been wanting to upgrade. The most important lesson I could pass on to a \"newbie\" is, \"No photographer is as good as the simplest camera.\" ~Edward Steichen.\n\n~~This past month my little XT has been dieing a slow terrible death. First the battery was draining after only two hours. Then the camera wouldn't function in manual mode. Once the lens wouldn't focus in auto mode I knew it was gone. But of course I still tried once in awhile. But with a full battery it won't turn on. After 5 years of being throw in the back seat with no camera bag, dropped many times in sand, dirt, water, snow, and being \"washed\" by my daughter, it has become part of my family. An extension of me. I don't know if anyone will recognize me without it covering half my face. I will definitely miss my XT.~~\n\nIf I wasn't ready to upgrade I would take it to a doctor. But lucky for me right around the corner the 60D is due to be released.

I take the usual memoir-type photos, but in addition I am a flora/fauna enthusiast. This camera with the stock lens--off the shelf--is great for taking close-ups of flowers and insects. I had anticipated having to buy a more specialized macro lens (and I no doubt will, eventually) for this type of work but I was pleasantly surprised to find that I could take better than expected closeups with the supplied kit lens.\n\nI also have aquariums and this camera is great for aqua-photography as well.\n\nPerformance: My last digital camera was a Nikon CoolPix. From necessity I got used to the lag-times involved in actually capturing images. With this Canon model, however, that's not an issue. When you click, you get your photo, and you can take one after another, without delay and with that satisfying \"click\" you get from an SLR. With the Nikon, I was never sure when I had even taken a picture.\n\nThis camera is outstanding. The only issue that may affect your decision is weight. If you're looking for a small, light-weight type of casual camera then go with something else. This camera is designed more for those who want the flexibility/options of the traditional SLR. It's got the heft of an \"old-style\" SLR, so if you want something less cumbersome this isn't the model for you."},{"reviewerName":"Charlie B","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"love it, with 1 exception","reviewDate":"July 30, 2007","reviewText":"I was new to 35mm cameras when I purchased this camera. Within a couple of hours, I felt in command of most of the controls, and was taking good photographs. It has a built in light meter display, so you can adjust your settings to get appropriate light, before you shoot the picture.\n\nOne nice thing is that the camera shuts off if you accidentally leave it on, which I have done on several occasions.\n\nThe only complaint I have is the autofocus. I shoot photos of animals indoors, and I have enough to worry about without having to manually focus the camera. At the same time, I need this kind of camera to have control of lighting. The autofocus in these situations is too slow, or it seems confused and unable to choose what to focus on.\n\nLoading photographs onto my PC seems to go very slowly as well.\n\nI recommend getting the best lens you can afford (widest range of focal lengths) since the one that comes standard in most packages is a little limiting.

I will skip the technical details (since they can be obtained from the Canon website), and get straight to the relavent points.\n\nThe camera is nicely designed, light yet packed with features. People with big hands, may find it difficult to use the camera, but since I have relatively small hands, I am not complaining. The layout of buttons and the menu is very clean and simple. The manual is very detailed and I would recommend you read the manual even if you have used a Canon earlier.\n\nThe body is all plastic and feels cheap. I would have really liked if there was say a rubber grip or something that would aid in getting a better hold. The lense that comes with the camera is probably not the best but still gives great shots! I would recommend buying just the body and a good quality lens preferably the image stabilized.\n\nTo sum it up, a great camera from Canon at an unbeatable price yet not compromising on features.

They are finally replacing my 20d with the new 30d - but that's another story. As an aside, I don't believe the problem was with the 20d as much as it was the company that Best Buy contracted with to do the repairs.\n\nAnyways, on to the review. I gave a rating of 4 stars because it is a good camera in its own right. But after owning a 20d for almost two years, I was much, much happier with the 20d than with the Rebel XT.\n\nBut don't get me wrong, the XT is still a very good camera for the money. The picture quality is superb, with crystal clear pictures. I did notice a difference in color rendering with the XT, but a lot of that could have been my lack of experience with the XT as the the controls are somewhat different than on the 20d.\n\nAnother major difference between the two cameras is size. If you have large hands, you will definitely appreciate the larger 20d. The XT is much smaller and feels more like a toy in my hands. Its plastic body (as opposed to the magnesium alloy body of the 20d and 30d) made me a little nervous as well. Although I've never dropped my camera (knock on wood), I think the added ruggedness of the magnesium body adds a bit of insurance to your investment.\n\nOne other major difference is the focusing. I noticed that the XT doesn't auto focus nearly as well as the 20d. It tended to focus on the wrong point more often than I would have liked.\n\nAll in all, the XT is a very good camera and is a smart purchase if your budget pushes the 20d or 30d out of reach. However, if you can afford to spend the extra money, I think the added features are definitely worth it."},{"reviewerName":"PhotoGuyCA","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great Camera for the money","reviewDate":"November 30, 2007","reviewText":"I am far from a professional photographer but I think anyone can take great pictures with this camera. I did alot of research before deciding wether to replace a privious pocket digital with the Rebel and I am glad that I got the Rebel. The picture quality is great and the fact that the camera is very user friendly is also obviously a major plus. I've always been one to take and share pic's and most people have noticed the change in quality of the pic's from my old camera to Rebel. I still havn't used all of the features but have played around with some nighttime photography as well as daylight and indoor and have been very pleased. Some of the features I don't know that I will ever use but I figure that if I ever decide to pursue them they are there.

It came just a few days before my trip so I had little time to get acquainted with all the features. In spite of that, it worked flawlessly during my week in Rome and I came back with hundreds of beautiful shots. Now that I have had a little time with the camera, I've found that there are a number of handy features I didn't initially notice. I'm just an amateur photographer, so I can't give a professional perspective, but from an amateur standpoint it is a superb camera that gives excellent results. Time exposures can be done automatically and come out great. Auto exposure usually works well, and it easy to override for special conditions. As with any digital camera, you can review the results immediately and make adjustments if needed. I only purchased mine with two lenses, to cover a wide variety of focal lengths, but as soon as I have the money, there are numerous available accessories I would love to have.

The 1st best thing about it is that it is compatible with Canon's film SLR EOS Camera lenses!! This alone makes it a great value!! All of the lenses I have fit and didn't have to spend additional funds for it. I spent the extra though for the standard Digital 18-55mm lens package and it is a nice lense but remember it is for the Digital Rebel only. The picture quality is also great!! You can set the settings for how well you want your resolutions and that means alot. This camera captures photos on a CF card. The camera has software included for editing and viewing your photos on the computer. But on the back of the Rebel is a viewscreen for viewing photos right after taking the photo as well as review. It is definately a plus having this feature. You also get a cord for transferring your photos onto your PC as well. I've been able to fit over 1000+ photos on my 1GB CF card.

Unfortunatly that is expensive with film. With digital, you can \"throw away\" for free any pictures you don't like. But, digital can be sloooooow. The Canon Rebel XT shoots three frames a second. Do you know what it was like at Christmas this year to be firing away at all the crazy kids and not missing a single moment? You know how you \"see\" a shot, and then a person moves before the digital camera catches it? Not with my Rebel! It is on in 1/5 of a second and I can fire a picture in the remaining part of that second.. and then keep clicking away with its powerful flash keeping up to speed. Sure, the price reflects all the myriad professional adjustments you can make to it. You say you are just an amatuer and don't need 'em? Put it in full auto and it sets up the shots for you!

I have pulled quite a few shots I have been extremely impressed with. However, I was recently performing some lens sharpness testing, and in the middle of it, my mirror lock-up feature stopped working: it would not record an image at all while that custom function was enabled. I called Canon's technical support number, and the guy on their end was very friendly and we tried resetting the camera to its default settings and custom functions. When this failed to work, he gave me the address to return it for repairs, not really mentioning that because I was out of warranty that this wouldn't be a cheap expenditure. I'm sure he couldn't really speculate as to how much since he didn't know the problem, but a heads up of the possibility would have been nice. Instead, I got an email notification of the repairs estimate, and it was $210!!!!! Not too much shy of what a person might buy a used or rebuilt camera for on here. For $50, a person can get an extended warranty from Canon for an additional 4 years. I think that would be well worth it, since you know you will pay significantly more than that in repair costs if and when your camera goes south. Something to think seriously about, because it is an electronic item, and the standard warranty of a year doesn't get you very far. I would have to say that I think Canon's repair charges are a bit steep though given the total worth of such a camera. I can't say that I'll take my shopping to another brand's camera lineup though, because I do like Canon's products, but I was just disappointed this time that they couldn't get that function back up and running for considerably less."},{"reviewerName":"Carol","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Awesome Camera","reviewDate":"August 26, 2005","reviewText":"Just received this camera as an anniversary present.

I photographed a painting on our living room wall from quite a distance. When printed on 4x6 photo paper, I could still even read the signature on the painting. As others have stated, there is almost no shutter lag at all--even with a standard 512mb Compact Flash card to record the images. The menus are very easy to understand, and the features are easy to choose and set. The Black and White capabilities are awesome! The ability create and set custom parameters is wonderful.\n\nThe camera accepts my lenses from the Rebel 2000; however, it does not particularly like my Quantaray 70-300mm zoom lens. Sometimes it works, and sometimes I get an error code 99. It prefers original Canon lenses.

This is perfect for me and the feel of the camera in my hand is quite \"hefty.\"\n\nI recommend a screen cover for the LCD because it is smudged by the nose while taking pictures.

It has all of the features you could want as an advanced beginner for setting the creative zones for personalized photography. I think it will even work for the novice who just wants to use it in the automatic zone, too!!

I first bought the Canon Powershot S2. I thought that was a decent camera, but after using it for a couple of days, it was obvious that in 6 months I would want more horsepower.\n\nSo I returned it and bought the Digital Rebel XT (otherwise known as the 350D). It was definitely the right decision.\n\nI won't go into many technical details as so many people already have, but instead would like to inform anybody on the fence between point and shoots and SLRs to definitely go with the SLR. The 350D is worth every penny. It is a joy to be able to grab the camera, flick it on (0.2 second startup) and shoot. At 3 frames per second with a good memory buffer, you will be all set to capture your shots at a moment's notice. That is something that point and shoots simply cannot do. I don't know about you, but I value the ability to flip on my camera and instantly get a shot.\n\nThe 350D was the highest rated digital SLR in the recent Consumer Reports magazine too. Everybody I know who has one loves it.\n\nFrom the camera startup, to shooting, to uploading the images on my PC, the 350D performs excellently. The menu system is well designed, the buttons are accessible. The more I use the camera, the more I like it.\n\nThis is a much lighter camera than Canon's next in line 20D. The 20D is made of metal and is about $500 more. The 350D has a plastic body (but it's quality, sturdy and has a very solid feel). Best of all, the camera is LIGHT. You can barely feel it hanging on your shoulder.\n\nThe 350D kit (as opposed to just the body) comes with an 18-55 lens. This is an economical lens, about $100 retail, but I think it's very good quality for its price.\n\nThe 350D, as well as the 20D, can use all of Canon's \"EF\" series lenses (the world's largest assortment of interchangeable lenses). This means that if you want to invest in lenses, you can do so with confidence because when it's time to upgrade the camera body, all of your lenses will fit.\n\nSo, yeah, this camera is fantastic. It's light, versatile and powerful. Because of this, barriers to usage are minimal. What I mean is that if you want to go somewhere, it is easier than ever before to bring your camera along. Its size, weight and ability to respond quickly to real life photographic situations make it a pleasure to use."},{"reviewerName":"Charles hardges","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"One Star","reviewDate":"May 20, 2015","reviewText":"Not good!"},{"reviewerName":"Bradley J.

The only downside to that camera was it was quite heavy and it was silver (my lenses were all black).\n\nSo when the XT came out I was excited. Initially I was expecting to see an improvement in performance, but when you go from 6MP to 8MP you're really not improving on the resolution (roughly the square root of the MPs). This camera still gives quick, sharp photos. Plus it's smaller and lighter than the 6mp digital rebel. I also found that the XT felt more solid and less like plastic. The setting dial is made of metal instead of plastic. I also found that the batteries seem to last for a really long time on this camera. So I don't really worry about switching out when I want to get a shot.\n\nOverall I'm really glad I purchased this camera.

Well, I received the camera over a week ago and I can't believe how good this camera is. Been a long time 35mm SLR user and a Digicam user since 2001. This camera is the closest to film you will get for the price and with all the advantages digital has to offer (technically speaking, a DSLR would have to be 12 megapixels to exactly match 35mm film quality). My only reservation is it's small size but that is a very minor complaint. A friend of mine has a Canon 20D and it is a better camera, but only slightly and costs $500.00 more. Save your money or spend it on a better lens, I bought the Canon EFS 17-85mm and it performs beautifully. By the way, don't believe all the critics that say megapixels aren't important and 6 megapixels are enough - that is not true. Even though most people are not printing large 8X10 or larger prints, many photos are indeed cropped and the more megapixel per photo there is the sharper the photo will remain.

Because anything more than 50 feet or if you're trying to capture a specific element of a landscape shot, you'll find the kit lens lacking.\n\n3. Manual settings are a little difficult to figure out. Okay, when I bought this camera I knew nothing of f-stops or shutter speed and any combination of these. I am still closer to confused than comprehending, but I've found I want to start trying out these seetings and it isn't obvious how to set these yourself. For those who want to just take a picture the cheat-sheet at the top (a wheel you turn to tell the camera what type of combination of f-stops/shutter speed/etc you want) is more than adequate (and I've had no problems using it). But after starting to learn what you can do by modifying f-stops and shutter speeds, I have started to yearn for a more newbie friendly process. Again, though, this is really dependent on the type of person you are. I like lots of control so this has started to gnaw at me some (though no where near enough to rate less than 5 stars)\n\nThe good (and I think they're real good):\n\n1. I've never had any of the pictures developed (I bought a digital camera for a reason), but image wise, the pictures are great quality. As I take pictures with the highest resolution the camera allows I find I'm often disappointed by a picture until I remember that the picture is 3x larger than what my monitor displays, and when I view full size the detail is incredible. I had a chance to shoot some tidepools, and I'm not sure the urchins and starfish looked that good in person.\n\n2. Lots of high-quality pictures. I bought 2, 2GB memory cards and I can fit 566 highest quality JPEG pictures on them. With two cards I've never had to worry about being selective with my shots. Professionals might find this untrue, but as a budding hobbyist, I'm extremely happy.\n\n3. Battery life, I read somewhere that you should have 2-3 times as many batteries as you think you'll need. Well I'm a little curious about that one. I have 1 battery and I've never been concerned about losing a charge. I've virtually filled both of my 2GB cards up on the same battery (800+ pictures) and it still showed a nearly full charge. Now I may be less demanding than most because:\na) I don't review pictures, I do that when I return home\nb) I don't take many pictures with the camera's flash\n\nBut even when I've forgotten and left the camera on for a few days after taking a few hundred shots, it still shows a nearly full battery. Now you probably should have a few extras just in case, but if you aren't away for extended periods, battery concerns are quite minimal.\n\n4. Ease of use - The Canon is VERY forgiving. Even right of the box, if you leave the settings on automatic and let the camera decide the settings you'll be very happy with the shots. Knowing how to adjust the settings will give you an incredible shot, but for the rest of us, we can let the Canon select the settings and come out with a very good shot that more than meets our hopes.\n\n*****\n\nSummary: This 8MP is a greaty starter camera and looks to be able to scale upward. It is very forgiving of your ignorance, allows you ample ways to upgrade as your understanding grows, and is a joy to use.\n\nEven if you plan on becoming a pro, this is a great camera to cut your teeth on without breaking the bank. I'd recommend this camera to any beginner or non-professional."},{"reviewerName":"Varun Sharma","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Best DSLR I have ever used","reviewDate":"January 24, 2009","reviewText":"I would have rated it 6 out of 5, but they didnt give me any option to do that.

You will probably not notice the 2 MP difference between this camera and the XTI unless you are doing a lot of photo manipulation or printing very large prints. Plus shooting in RAW will help you from losing data while correcting photos.\nThe Censor cleaner on the XTI is just one more moving part that could break.

If you've done any research you've probably come to realize that the 18-55mm kit lens is a dud. it produces poor color saturation, it's slow as Christmas, and is not very sharp. You can improve the color saturation a little with a polarizing filter, but you're better off just not buying the lens. For (...) you can get a great little 50mm fixed lens that is pretty sharp from about f1.8 - f8 and it has great color saturation.\nIt's also true that you have to compose the shot through the view finder and not on the LCD. You're playing with the big boys now! There's more to think about than whether to use the \"little mountain\" or the \"little stick man.\" Shutter Speed, aperture, ISO Sensitivity, White balance, Light meter, and the ability to lock the focus are all viewed through the view finder.\nHere's the rub with the XT... It's Tiny, It's plastic, and any thing shot with an ISO of 800 and above is pretty worthless. It's not a pretty grain!\nIf I had to do it over again I would have gotten the 30D for several reasons. If I was debating on getting the XT or the XTI I'd lean towards the XT. The 2MP difference wouldn't affect me.

The Canon Digital Rebel XT was my choice as I have always been satisfied with Canon and the quality of their cameras. The camera is aimed at the serious amateur photographer, and priced at under $1000. So onto my impressions of it.\n\nThe first thoughts on the camera after opening its box is the size, it is one of the more compact SLRs on the market. Some may dislike this, but for me it is a positive feature of the camera. The aesthetics of the camera are good; I choose the model with the silver body. The first minus is the lack of a supplied compact flash card. Canon are a little mean in this regard, and even with their point-and-shoot digital cameras only supply a small (32 MB or so) CF card. I would recommend purchasing at least 1 GB CF card for this camera. For the price Canon really should try and do better. The rest of the review is very positive. Computer support is good (Mac and PC) with the bundled CD applications, though it isn't good enough to tempt me away from Editing in Photoshop. The camera interface is straight forward, and the auto-focus will allow many to use this camera and produce great quality images without the need to change the settings. AT 8 MP, image quality and definition are very high. The manual and supporting documentation is very good and detailed, so without too much effort you can easily learn how to adjust the image settings to produce exactly the picture you wish. The user-interface and LCD is good and easy to work with, and I find Battery life is good.\n\nAll-in-all an excellent package. One of the best SLR cameras of its type on the market, and you don't have to be a \"pro\" to take excellent pictures with it. If you don't have one then definitely order a case for the camera, a good quality photo printer, and longer term you will probably want to invest in a tripod and extra lenses.

But then I would have had to figure out how to add a star to this rating.\n\nI bought this toy/tool for my work photos (I do custom woodwork and glass etch (home improvement, art, etc.)) and wanted a camera that didn't fight me for every photo. In short, a camera which was reasonably easy to operate, but which would not have to be upgraded any time soon. Currently, I only have the stock lens.\n\nThough it is going to take a little time to get to know the intricacies of operating this toy for that museum quality photo, I am able to get great photos from the start. The menus are far easier to navigate than my point and shoot (an Olympus C4000). I just have to remember to switch between program options (e.g., close up and portrait group, shutter and priority group). Too, of course, the camera can grow in capability, since the lenses put me back in the category of a 35mm SLR. While I miss the on screen view finder, for setting up certain shots, the trade off in quality of an SLR makes it easier to tolerate that compromise.\n\nThe quality of shots with the stock cheap lens are so good, compared to my previous camera, I long for the time I can compare photos by it with a quality lens. My next investment for the camera will be a zoom lens. I'm not a pro, so the loss of quality, as compared to a fixed lens, shouldn't hurt too much, especially since the choice available is compromise or forgo the increased capability entirely.\n\nI bought the extra battery with this. I've had the camera a month, shot a couple hundred photos and at least twenty percent were with a flash. I'm still running on the same battery. Sweet deal.\n\nI bought the 4 gig flash card. You can have my house, my car or my dog, but leave this card alone. Before, I had to plan my shots and download daily to clear it for the next round. I was limited to around twenty shots. Now I can shoot for a couple weeks and barely dent the card's capacity. It will hold around four or five hundred high quality photos. If I went to low res, well, that exceeds human capacities for comprehension of infinity (okay, maybe that's an exaggeration, but you get the point).\n\nThere has been a lot of good advice from people far more learned in photography than I, so I won't attempt to further remark on this camera's virtues. I would, however, offer the following:\n\n(1) While a point-and-shoot may be right for many, if there is a chance you will get the photography bug, might want to expand your abilities, might need the versatility of better lenses at some point, or just like awesome toys, make the jump to a SLR digital.\n(2) If your camera didn't come with it, shop around for a good quality photo editing program. It doesn't have to be high end, but should allow for effects, album management and so forth. That can be almost as important as a quality lense."},{"reviewerName":"Peter Jackson","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Strong Camera with many improvements. Love it.","reviewDate":"March 16, 2005","reviewText":"I bought this camera about a week ago to replace my film-based Rebel G. My previous digital experience was with a 2MP Canon Powershot S100. I'm not a professional photographer, but I really like taking photographs (vs. snapshots). Canon has bundled a lot of goodies into a small, sturdy camera base that has proven iteself very capable to me.\n\nThe contents of the package include a battery, the camera base, 3 CD with software and PDFs, a USB 2.0 connector, a video connector, a battery charger, a 18-55mm EF-S lens, a strap, and a manual. You'll need to provide your own CompactFlash card. I personally selected a 1GB Ultra II card, which will shoot about 70 RAW+JPEG images, or 275 Large JPEGS.\n\nThe battery arrives already charged, so I could immediately take pictures. Kudos. That is a favor that I appreciate. I shot a hundred pictures before getting home.\n\nThe Digital Rebel XT has the familiar basic mode and creative mode control dial on the top. They have added an \"On/Off\" switch, which was not present on my film-based Rebel G. The consistency in the controls made it possible for me to shoot my first pictures right away, though there are some features to read the manual for: the TTL flash metering discussion, the nuances of choosing the AF mode, and how the basic mode operation decides which ISO speed to use were the topics I found myself most interested in this week.\n\nPictures look really sharp and colorful up to the ISO 400 setting. ISO 800 and 1600 can be safely used if you are looking for a particular effect, are shooting where a flash and tripod are not permittted, or in other very low light situations. It's going to be pretty grainy, but with the included software tools, it can be compensated for to a limited extent.\n\nThe on-camera flash is not great, but it is very good for a built-in flash. In a pinch, it'll work, but serious picture taking will require an external flash.\n\nThe included software products have both PC and Mac versions, a boon to Mac users. My Canon snapshot camera only included PC software. Canon bundles a RAW image editor that is handy if you shoot RAW. iPhoto's RAW \"support\" isn't adequate for adjusting photos. Otherwise, the included software isn't much better than the iLife suite, unless heavy image manipulation is required. In that case, Photoshop is a better choice anyhow. PC users will get some use out of the photo editing software, though.\n\nTIP: If you are loading pictures onto a newer Mac with iPhoto, set the Communication Method on the camera to PTP/Print, NOT PC Connection. Otherwise, the Mac won't find the camera. That detail doesn't appear anywhere in the manual, though PTP/Print is the default (but not the intuitive) setting.\n\nThe lens is OK. It's a decent value for $100, but I wish it would mount to a film camera in addition to a digital EF-S mount. Remember the focal length multiplier when you plan to share your lenses between film and digital cameras. A 50mm all-around lens on a film camera is a 80mm moderate telephoto lens on the Rebel XT.\n\nThe strap is lousy. You'll want a different strap unless ithcy, sweaty, rubberized material is your idea of a comfy strap. I decided not to use it.\n\nTo sum up, this camera really impressed me. The resolution is great, the images are as good as I could reasonably expect from my camera skills, and the total paackage operates well together. Areas where Canon could improve the package include:\n\n1. Ship it with an EF lens, not an EF-S\n2. Ship it with better quality accessories. That strap is terrible.\n3. Include a CF card.\n4. Ditch the unnecessary tools from the bundle of software. Every OS has photo management software built in. If that's not adequate for someone, they've probably already bought a package that they use.\n\nOtherwise, I loved it.\n\nFollowup 25-March-2005:\nThis is a followup comment to my review on the Rebel XT. The reason I've decided to follow up is that I've seen a lot of people equating the Digital Rebel XT to the Canon 20d because it has similar features and resolution. The conclusion, then, that the 20D is not worth the extra $599 is what has me concerned.\n\nTake note: the Canon EOS 20D has an expected shutter life of 150,000 photographs. The Canon Digital Rebel XT has an expected shutter life of 50,000 photographs. What does this mean to you? Well, if your shutter dies after 50,000 pictures, even within the warranty period, it counts as normal wear and tear, and you have to pay to have it fixed.\n\nIf your 20D quits after 50,000 snaps, you get a new shutter free of charge. It turns out that the cost to have a shutter repaired on an XT is about half of the price difference. So figuring in expected depreciation of the camera based on shutter life, the two cameras are similarly priced."},{"reviewerName":"Mark Hornberger","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Not perfect, but a great camera","reviewDate":"June 5, 2005","reviewText":"This is my 2nd D-SLR, after the Pentax *ist D. I switched because more lenses are made for Canon, the lenses are easier to find, and Canon also has USM focusing available. I've had the camera for a little over a month, and don't regret buying it at all. It IS small, and light. The 20D looks better on paper and feels more solid, but it's also larger and heavier-about half a pound more than the Rebel XT. After using the Rebel XT for a few days the size didn't seem like a disadvantage anymore. It isn't weather-sealed, but neither is the 20D.\n\nLike others have noted, the LCD is hard to read in direct sunlight. Here is where we see the advantage of having most information (ISO level, etc) in the small grey LCD--it's readable in all lighting conditions, whereas the color LCD washes out in bright sunlight.\n\nThe camera also rattles a little, due to the hinges on the pop-up flash. It doesn't sound broken or worrisome, but you are definitely aware that this isn't a professional-grade, durable camera.\n\nThe XT doesn't feel as durable and substantial as the Pentax *ist D, or the Nikon D70, or some of the offerings from Minolta and Olympus. But at the same time, it doesn't feel cheap to me. Frequently the heft and density of cameras gives the illusion of quality. The Rebel XT, though it feels superficially a little flimsy, is much more of a camera than any point-and-shoot superzoom made by Sony, Canon, or anyone else. SLRs give you much faster focus, much better low-light performance, and the advantage of interchangeable lenses.\n\nThat being said, you may be disappointed if you expect to get the Rebel XT and only the kit lens. The kit lens isn't a good indoors or low-light lens. If you absolutely don't want to spend any more money past the initial investment, stay away from SLRs. You'll still get some advantages, granted, such as the faster focus, but overall it might be a disappointing experience for you. I like the XT's kit lens, but it has its limitations. There is no one do-it-all-well perfect lens. If you shoot under good lighting conditions from f8-f11 you'll get good pictures with the kit lens and have nothing to worry about. In a dimly lit room you'll need either a faster lens or something with image stabilization, like the Canon 17-85mm.\n\nOverall, this is a great camera, and the kit lens is a perfectly serviceable beginning lens, which is also small and light enough for travel. I would prefer a more solid build, but I opted for the lighter weight and smaller size of the XT over the better build and durability of the 20D. Both take about equivalent pictures, though there are some specs that are different, like more frames per second and ISO 3200 capability on the 20D. Ultimately SLRS are more about lenses than the camera, and really all photography is more about the photographer than the equipment. The XT, with the right lenses, is as capable as anything else on the market. Unless you need ISO 3200, or 5 frames per second, or a heavier, sturdier build, I see little reason to opt for the 20D. Put the $500 difference into lenses instead, and you won't regret it."},{"reviewerName":"Larry VanDeSande","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"A knockout","reviewDate":"January 10, 2006","reviewText":"I had a $400 credit and 10 percent off coupon at a national chain store and bought one of these for my wife for Christmas.

The images are great up to ISO 400 and very good at 800 and 1600. For the price it's hard to beat, but I'd probably recommend going for a newer camera with the ISO displayed in the viewfinder and a better auto focus system. Also, the included lens is so-so. I use a Sigma 17-70 which is excellent. The 3fps it captures is not quite fast enough for sports, but fine for kids.

Startup time is very quick and making adjustments to shutter speed and aperture is intuitive.\n\nIf you get the bundle with the kit lens, I highly recommend complimenting it with the very affordable Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 II lens, especially if you are a big fan of DOF and do a lot of available-light / low-light photography."},{"reviewerName":"U. Carpenter","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Canon XT (350D) Review","reviewDate":"January 11, 2007","reviewText":"This was my first DSLR and a very good choice at that.It has numerous features,alot like the higher class Canon cameras.Like alot of reviews I write I often start with the bad,because when I was researching this camera and others,thats what I wanted to hear first.So thats where Ill start with this one.\n\nCons:\n\nEven though I wouldnt say I have huge hands it still felt small in them.If you happen to have smaller hands,male of female,then this wouldnt be a problem.Its more of a preference than it is a knock against the quality of it.I just feel it should still be mentioned.And with that said,you will often find little white fingernail scuff marks on the inside right part of the lens housing,next to the grip.I have heard others complain about the size and awkwardness of the grip and in my opinion that was very trivial.If youre looking for complaints about body and design,much can be said about every camera out there,so to me,I was more interested in the performance.But if you do worry about the design of it,then I will add that it is made of a type of plastic,rather than a alloy like the other higher end Canon cameras are,which again to me,trivial but can be noticed when compared.Back to performance,it is a tad slow on the focusing.Another obstacle I noticed was when taking spontanious pictures often it would go into the self timer due to me accidently pressing one of the buttons and changing the setting.Im not sure I credit that to the size of the body or the simplistic way of altering a feature.Then there is the sensor size.Some will say full frame is better,others swear by cropped sensors.It really all depends on what you want to shoot.Cropped sensors definately have thier place in the world of photography.This camera along with alot of Canon dslr cameras has a sensor crop of 1.6x.Also not the ideal camera for fast action captures.You can time it right and get a great pic,but the slower frame rate per second is somewhat a dilema,especially when filming birds or shooting a sequence of a race car rounding a corner or quaterback throwing a football.The 7 points of focus are adequate but not always enough.There is not a spot metering feature on this camera,but there is a partial metering which is not as bad as some may think.Very much a plus when taking a portrait with alot of backlight.Another 'quark' is that the viewfinder is rather small,which when I started,forced me to use the lcd screen to set exposure and composition,which is not ideal.I now use it to read the histogram,after doing so then Ill adjust accordingly.Just another feature I found useful after learning over time about photography.\n\nPros:\n\nThe 8mp is plenty for blwoing up prints.If you plan on blowing them up over 16x20 then I could see where the quality of the picture would decline,SLIGHTLY.But for sizes up to that it is very detailed and crisp.The auto mode will most likely be the best place to start.The camera will adjust the settings according to what youre pointing at.Essentially a point and shoot camera,when in this mode.Then you have the other modes such as portraits,landscapes,macro,etc etc that are designed for their designated purposes.Very handy and a great learning tool for the more hands-on modes such as aperture(AV),shutter speed(TV),etc etc.The Program mode is where you can learn about exposure,the camera will evaluate,set the shutterspeed and aperture and you will be able to alter the exposure and flash output.Very very handy when learning.As for the AV,TV,M modes,those are the ultra self adjusting features,the possibilities are almost endless when you grasp these modes.The wide range of lenses you can buy,EF or EF-S,are a definate plus for this camera.From the ultra wide to the super zoom.Theyll work with this camera.Why people have opted to go for the XTi over the XT is personal preference.Remember it does not change the quality of the image taken.The colors and detail in the pictures from this camera are top notch,much like alot of Canon cameras.The weight of this camera is very comfortable,again something some people take into consideration when buying,personally it didnt have any bearing on my decision,but thought it should be mentioned.This is also a fantastic camera for portraits and landscapes.\n\nFinal Words:\n\nThis is a beautiful camera that produces beautiful captures.A must have for any beginner dslr'er out there.A great learning tool as well.I have graduated to from a 4mp pocket camera,to a 6mp dslr-like Powershot S3,and I am now at this camera.I have used this camera and have gained knowledge about photography from this camera.Ive heard,and will agree,that this is a great camera to eventually figure out what kind of photography you want to do,whether it be weddings,landscapes,portraits or fast action,high speed.I have discovered that I want to venture into fast action,such as sports.Therefore this camera wouldnt be the top choice,that would be the 1D Mark II N.But again,I feel this camera has taught me enough about different styles and purposes of the camera bodies out there,which has in turned guided me to which style I want to pursue.And if youre wondering why I didnt opt for the XTi,its wasnt because it was higher it was because I felt this would be able to teach me the basics of the technical side to photography.Im not one to buy into the whole more mega pixel always means better pictures.Under most circumstance it really is irrelevant and if I were to present to you well taken photos from the XTi(10mp) and the XT(8mp),Im safe in saying I would bet that you couldnt tell the difference.It comes down to the photographer that decides what a photo will look like.Every camera can take poor,bad quality pictures if the person behind the viewfinder isnt well edjucated about the technical side of photography.Thus why I think this camera is a tool used for that purpose,to edjucate.If you get this camera you wont be sorry,a very very nice camera.If you are more concerned about looks and the feel of a camera than I suppose you can opt for the XTi,not a bad choice,very nice indeed,but not a large enough improvement for me to upgrade to it.\n\nSo have fun with photography,it can get in your blood,and see you down the road."},{"reviewerName":"Jean E.

It gives me the ability to zoom from a wide angle lens of 28 mm to a telephoto lens of 300 mm in a second, which is a great advantage in many situations,"},{"reviewerName":"Scott Meyers","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Good Camera, Good Deal","reviewDate":"July 14, 2007","reviewText":"Well,\n\nI spent my time researching DSLR cameras. I will avoid the specific details but my main decision factor was price. I wanted a camera that was under $700 (including a lens). I realize that I was probably you typical DSLR researcher and buyer. This was going to be my first DSLR camera, and I didn't want to break the bank while at the same time having room to expand.\n\nThe Canon XT fit into the price range while giving me the options I wanted. I didn't see the need to go up to the XTi, Nikon D40x, Nikon D80 because at 8 MP you can pretty much blow the XT pictures up to poster size and not really see huge loss in detail. I also had the luxury of choosing between all the different brands because I didn't have any lens already purchased. My main comparison came down to the Canon XT versus the Nikon D40. Both were similar in price (with the kit lens included), but when I went to the local camera store to try them out (I still purchased from Amazon, no sales tax really gives Amazon an advantage here) I kept coming back to the Canon XT.\n\nThe Canon XT has more autofocus points which were instantly apparent when I was just picking up the camera and trying to take pictures in the store. Also, in a non-scientific statement the Canon just felt better in my hands. I know it is made from plastic but it fit right into my hands and felt extremely comfortable. The one item that I did like the Nikon over Canon was that the Nikon uses SD cards instead of CF in the Canon. I just like SD better because most laptops now (including mine) have a slot where you can just slide the SD card in and the laptop reads the card exactly like a hard drive. Also, in talking to the kind individuals in the camera store and in searching online I found that the Canon type of lens (AF) are more common and there are more generic (Tamron, etc) lenses available so over the long run (where as I have found out that you are going to pay alot more for your lenses then you ever will for your DSLR camera) so this was another selling point of the Canon XT.\n\nMy first pictures with the camera were up in a trip to Alaska and the kit lens did OK but I could definitely see it limitations. That being said for a difference of $70 between body only and body and lens, I think this lens will serve me well until my skills develop more. I would rather learn on (and maybe break) the cheap kits lens and then move up to the better lens then start out dropping alot of money on expensive lenses.\n\nOverall, the Canon XT is everything I wanted it be. It fits right into my hands, the autofocus is good, all the controls are available for any skill level from novice to pro, and I didn't break the bank to purchase it (I got the Canon XT (with kit lens), a 2 GB card, and I nice little holster bag all from Amazon for under $725). I am pleased, the only reason I don't give this a 5 star rating is that I don't think the kit lens is perfect and I wish that you could take RAW photos in the Automatic modes (sometime I don't want to fiddle with the settings but I still want to modfiy the pictures later)"},{"reviewerName":"BigRob","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"It really is a good camera","reviewDate":"August 27, 2005","reviewText":"Let me say at the outset that I am an amateur photographer but I decided to buy this camera as a gift to myself from last year's salary bonus after previously owning a Canon 35mm SLR and the digital Canon G2. I wanted a camera that I could use for the next 5 years. I also went ahead and bought the recommended telephoto lens, the external flash and a 1GB flash card. I have been using the camera for about 1 year now and I can say that I'm reasonably satisfied with it. I did read all the reviews about it before purchase so I was aware that it had a 'problem' with under exposed shots when the flash is used at night. I thought I could live with that, as I was told that setting the White Balance (WB) to the appropriate setting would eliminate the underexposure. I have not found that to be the case and this has made me very wary about taking shots with the flash at night. I constantly have to check to see if the shot looks ok before the subjects move away. I think I need some guidance as to how to correct this issue once and for all.\n\nOne thing which surprised me was the filesize. Being an 8 megapixel camera, the smallest filesize still approaches half a megabyte. Trying to e-mail photos to my friends quickly fills up their inbox and often I have to zip and send files multiple times to send all the required files. The other thing which surprised me was that I had to use the viewfinder to take the pictures. Being an SLR, you can't use the LCD when taking shots. The LCD is used for review only. I was not aware of that having been acustomed to my G2 but that was more my ignorance than a fault of the camera. I would still recommend this camera, I have already done so to one of my close associates who have also gone ahead and bought the camera. I can't afford another camera for sometime to come."},{"reviewerName":"Steven Lafferty","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Nice entry level unit.","reviewDate":"September 27, 2012","reviewText":"I have had a Canon 350XT for some years now and have kept it for my backup unit.

As for the smallness of the body, if you are a person with large hands it is not going to feel good in your hands without having a battery grip installed. I have battery grips on all my camera bodies because I like not having to worry about running out of juice on a long hike in the middle of the day.

The Rebel was my first dslr and it was fine since I was a begginer. A few things I didn't like was how small the LCD screen was.

I have used film SLRs for over 20 years. Then a couple of years ago I bought a Nikon point and shoot. But I still preferred my film slr, except for that fact that I had to buy film, take the pictures, then wait for the results. I used the point and shoot more and more, for the instant results. But my wife and I got frustrated with the lag time, and the fact that most of the pictures with the point and shoot had to be posed. When I used my old Minolta (x700) and Nikon(N6006) slrs, all the pictures were spontaneous and captured the moments as they occurred. We were never able to do that with the Point and Shoot. So we decided to bite the bullet and buy into the DSLR world. I looked and compared for months on the best camera. \"What brand should I buy?, How many MP? What price range??????\n\nWhat sold me on the Canon was the cost and the quality of pictures it takes. I could have bought a more expensive camera, but then that would have left me with little money to add on. I took one piece of advice from the message boards and that was to not worry about the camera body, invest your money in glass. And coming from the film slr world that makes perfect sense. So we bought the Rebel XT.\n\nI have had it for two days and can only say how great it is. I love being able to compose pictures like I use to do with my film slrs, but being able to see the results instantly. I love being able to make adjustments and reshoot it instantly, not a week later when I got the film back. Yesterday I fired off 150 shots, which I never would have done with the film SLR, because of cost, and I probably would be waiting for the shutter on my point and shoot.\n\nI know the Rebel isn't the perfect camera. I wish I had a bigger LCD and the grip was a little more comfortable, but that is superficial. It is what is on the inside that counts. I compare it to owning a Toyota; it isn't the most luxurious car, but it gets the job done.

I'm sure even the pro's could use this as a backup camera (especially since its so small for a dslr)\n\nThe kit lens EFS18-55 is actually quite useful as a walkabout lens. It is like having two lenses in one. (Macro + Telezoom)\n\nThe reason for 4 stars was due to the fact that you can't give 1/2 stars. The only thing you can ding this package for is that it doesn't come with any compact flash, Even a starter 256MB card would've been nice, without jacking up the price so far.\n\nOverall, I am completely satisfied with the camera.

For the curmudgeons that said it doesn't feel like a traditional camera, you're right. But that's a good thing. It's smaller, lighter, faster, sleeker and takes great pictures. I'm sure tradition cameras will copy the XT's design. You'll find that it's not too small. The XT is like a Mercedes and the Nikon is like a Cadillac. My favorite feature is how easily I was able to take pictures from my powerbook. The photos displayed on my screen almost immediately. Then I could change the aperture, ISO, and take another photo instantly. I don't even know what that stuff means but I was able to see the results and through trial and error take a decent photo.

I've since purchased the 430EX flash, Sigma 18-200, Tomron 28-300 lens, Kinko 2X extender (cheap lens), Battery Grip, and a second battery. I love the manual settings for low-light work and taking several servo speed shots. I'm not familiar yet with taking RAW photo shots instead of JPEG, but I'm still researching this.\n\nI thought I would want the teleophoto lens most, but now I realize I'm more interested in the wide lens and I'm seriously looking at the Sigma 10-20mm lens. I still like the telephoto lens for the long distance shots, but I find I'm taking more photos either indoors or of large buildings and monuments where I want to get the whole object in the picture without being far away (where more obstacles block a clear sight).\n\nEssential gear is probably a large memory card!! I found an Ultra II 2GB CF card for $85 on another website - I had purchased about three 512MB cards and now I don't have to switch out so much for the high JPEG setting. A Tripod is needed for any serious telephoto, low-light, or any shot with long shutter speed. The battery grip is needed for those that think the camera is too small or want to at least look like a pro. I know I'm a rookie, but I love walking around Europe snapping shots anywhere I can.

You can do as much or as little creatively as you want to with this camera. The kit lens has been fine for what I use it for (mostly family/baby shots), but the zoom is a little lacking if you're wanting to use it from a distance (such as a sporting event). It's great if you have young children in the house who don't hold their cute expressions very long. I took 200 photos in no time, not realizing how many I had and still had plenty of room on the 2GB card. I've had to recharge the battery twice - using the viewfinder eats the battery up, so I'm weighing the pros and price of a spare, but it only takes an hour or 2 to recharge. (I did find the battery dead after not using the camera for a couple of days, when previously it had partial charge). There is a digital battery indicator on the screen, however, it only has two settings - fully charged and \"half\" charged, which can mean \"about to die,\" so if you do imporant shoots on a timetable, I'd have a fully charged spare.

I am viewing both in the Microsoft Office Picture Manager. The one from the point and shoot gets blurry at about 90%. The XT starts to get blurry at 250%. Whatever that means, I have no idea. To me it means that the APS-C sensor size is doing its job. Is it 100 dollars better then the point and shoot? YES. I think the zooms are the same with the lens that's on it now. Close ups look alot less distorted with the XT. In auto mode the XT is just as easy to use, except it takes pictures faster. And it's cooler to have a camera that looks like a camera. The only bad thing is that now I have to get a telephoto zoom lens because I want one. So, for 500 it's worth it without a doubt except for the fact that it's making me want to spend 200 more on a lens.\n***UPDATE - I've been playing with this camera for a few days now and I'm still happy with it. First, somebody said the thing is for small handed people. I'm a big mo-fo and my hand fits fine. I'm also impressed with battery life. The battery got low at 250 pics, but it still doesn't need to be charged yet at 375. The only thing I don't like is the battery meter it only has 3 settings: ok, low, and must be charged(which I havn't seen yet.) I also like how fast pictures can be taken, autofocus is fast too."},{"reviewerName":"M.

I have been nothing but impressed with its results.\n\nThe image quality, correctly exposed, is very good. I have made many 8x10 prints with no discernable noise, with extremely smooth color tone. The range of useable ISOs (100-1600) provides a lot of flexability, and noise is restrained even to 1600.\n\nThe controls provide quick and easy changes using the four keys on the back, and the shutter lag time is very short. Combined with a good lens, this camera will provide you the tools to make semi-professional work with ease.\n\nMy only complaint is the lack of spot-metering, which can yield some inconsistant readings (i.e. concert or uneven lighting). However, the inclusion of mirror lockup and flash compensation is more than enough to make up for this.\n\nI heartily recommend this camera to any consumer/semi-professional. There really is no reason to spend all the extra money on a 20D or 30D, when you can get equal results with a xt. Use the extra cash to buy lenses (like the new EF-S 17-55mm f/2.8 thats coming soon.

It is incredibly easy to use if you have done your homework...for example, you must use the viewfinder to shoot the picture, for some this is a turn off.\n\nAs for ergonomics, this camera is light and compact compared to other DLSR's, this has worked out great for me, because I have small hands. If you have larger hands I would suggest getting a battery pack grip to make it more comfortable.\n\nThe pictures so far have come out stunning using the kit lens. The kit lens is pretty flexible and will be able to take 90% of the shots you will need. However, I would suggest getting other lenses if you need to be a bit more creative. I think I'll be ordering the 75-300mm lens and EF 50mm f-1.8 II pretty soon!\n\nBattery life is great, mine lasted through hundreds of shots, and it comes halfway charged right out of the box, so you don't have to wait to play with your new baby!!! And as for memory cards, I would suggest going with a high speed memory card, if you don't you won't be able to take advantage of the burst mode. The SanDisk Ultra II 2 GB will get the job done quick enough, plus it's cheaper than the SanDisk Extreme III.\nIf you are looking into taking the plunge into SLR photography, as I was, DO IT!!

I have since not looked back. This camera has brought nothing but joy to myself and others. The sharpness and colors from the famed Canon sensor are true to their reputation. Friends and family all love the pictures that come out of this camera.\n\nAfter selling my Rebel, I debated upgrading to the new Rebel XT or the 20D, which I'm sure many of you might be having right now before pulling the trigger. I held both in my hand and played with them at the PMA tradeshow where the XT was introduced. It was very light and felt very small in my hands. I don't have exceptionally large hands, but the XT felt like it was designed for smaller hands. That being said, it is a great travel partner to have being so compact and light-weight.\n\nThe only other drawback, however, is that the user interface is quite different from the 20D. Although it may seem like a trivial feature, the dial navigation on the 20D has been immensely more convenient and practical when shooting compared to pressing the buttons on the Rebel or the XT. I didn't like having to navigate through the ISO or other changes to white balance via the LCD screen. I definitely think there's a reason why the 20D is more expensive beyond the fact that it has the solid magnesium alloy body. The user interface for me was worth the extra money as well. The more you take photos, the more you will realize the freedom that comes with controlling your aperture, shutter speed, white balance and more with the 20D interface versus the XT. That being said, it is still several hundred dollars more expensive and the sensors are practically the same (the XT has 0.2 fewer megapixels). But the XT will give you the same stunning results because the differences are mainly external.\n\nThe XT is not for everyone just as the 20D is not for everyone. I suggest strongly considering and weighing the differences between the two camera bodies before purchasing and prioritizing what's most important to you between size, weight, and UI. If you travel a lot and don't want to lug around a heavy camera...then without a doubt get the XT. It's the same bang for less buck and for the price the XT package can't be beat.\n\nI highly recommend getting the kit lens with either camera. For an additional 100 or so bucks it is well worth it just for the range and it has pretty decent quality results. Bang for your buck it can't be beat. Make sure you pick up a EF 50mm f/1.8 II USM lens for another 80 bucks. This is a powerful little lens at a great price.\n\nI have had so many friends ask me about my camera and my pictures, that I decided to create a site called eosrebels.com that you might find helpful in making your decision and learning about the basics of digital SLR photography. It's specifically for owners of the Canon EOS digital SLRs. Check it out for useful tips and research that will help you get started on this rewarding journey of digital photography! Either way you won't regret your purchase. It would make an incredible gift, not only for Christmas or a birthday, but for life.

The autofocus is slow, and faulty for dark places. The ISO goes only to 1600, and even then the noise is nearly unmanageable. 1600 is not that great either - I am lucky that I have a f/1.8 lens. There have been times where I have shot at f/1.8, 1/30, and still been underexposing by 2/3 of a stop. Thank goodness for the RAW format!\n\nFor what it is, the Rebel is great.

I travel a lot due to my proffesional affairs as well as personal. I needed a camera that could shoot fast and acurate pictures and would not be to costly. I purchased a Konica Minolta Dimage A200 ( which I use as a secondary camera ) but is a bit to slow for my taste even though it takes amazing pictures. Honestly, Canon's agressive marketing technique was one of the major factors in my desition as far as purchasing the camera or at least looking into it; the camera was displayed every where from Dubai to Europe to Asia to New York, so I started looking into it. The reviews were great and when I was finally able to get my hands on one at a camera store, I just fell in love with it, shorty after I purchased the camera, and have no regrets, especially after understanding all the menus and functions of it, I have become more of a photographer than I ever though I would be.

Was very impressed with the 20D, but the price difference could easily give me a very good lense, and the feature differences are minor, so Rebel XT it is. I am a photography enthuiast who wishes he had the budget for a canon 1D MarkII but instead have the budget of a mortal and have to pay for a personal camera out of his own pocket.\n\nI have been reading some other reviews on this site and other sites regarding digital SLR cameras in general. I had to admit, most of the reviewers really are better served with a point and shoot. This is a SLR camera, it will take great pictures in automatic modes, but if you use your camera in those modes, get something like the Canon Pro1. This camera is to be used in Av, Tv or Manual modes, maybe in Program in a pinch. It requires you to understand WB, depth of fields, exposure metering as well as other wide array of nuances that come with a SLR camera. If you don't want to spend some time to learn some details about photography, you will be better served with a point and shoot. If you decide to use the attached flash for in door portrait shots, you're probably better served with a point and shoot. If you need to frame your shot on the LCD, you're better served with a point and shoot (becasue the whole SLR concept of through the lense view of the scene, DOF checking, focus accuracy is completely lost by that opinion). Yes the sensor on dSLR's will get dirty and require maintenance. Some one mentioned why don't engineer design the sensor to have the opposite charge to rebel dust. Well, dusts don't have one single polarity in their charges, so 50% of the dust will be attracted to the sensor doesn't matter what polarity the sensor is charged with.\n\nAlso, this is not a Canon 1Ds either, so it does have its limitations, but then again, people who will feel completely limited by this camera should have gotten a Canon 1D series camera anyway.\n\nThe best merit for this camera is foremost image quality. It's extremely low in image noise all the way up to ISO 800. ISO 1600 is completely usable if you stay below 8x10 enlargement and don't mind photoshopping your image a little. Again, if you don't ever want to bother with photoshop adjustment of you pictures, you probably will be better served with a point and shoot. The kit lense is of decent quality again for the price, but you're definitely short changing yourself if that's the only lense you decide for have for this camera. If you want to buy the kit and had no intention to buy another lense, you shoud seriously be considering Canon Pro1, it's got a L glass and a good match between the lense and the body. Buying this camera will be at most 50% of your investment if you truly want to make it worthwhile, the other 50% will be needed for buying good lenses (get the Canon 17-40mm USM L lense, the 70-200 4L zoom, and the 28-135mm as a walk-around, the Tamron 28-74 is an excellent medium range lense as well and is probably a superior substitue for the Canon 28-135 USM).\n\nI would have to say lack of spot metering does give the Nikon D70 an advantage, but this camera does have a center metering mode with exposure lock, so it is not really a show-stopper. Compared to the D70, the Rebel XT has superior noise level performance. This is from my personal experience as well as photos from a wide variety of sites on the net. Low noise level is very important to me, so if this is on your priority list, you really can't go wrong with the Rebel XT at this price point.\n\nWhat I want to emphasize here is seriously consider your needs before buying this camera, to make this camera truly worth the money you spent, you need to spend a bit more of your money and a lot of more of your time on learning how to properly handle a piece of equipment like this. Otherwise, you guessed it, Canon Pro1 is a very very good candidate."},{"reviewerName":"No Busking","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Still the best deal on the market - but don't buy the kit lens","reviewDate":"March 9, 2006","reviewText":"I've had mine for about 9 months now, and have worked with it enough to use most of the features without the manual. It's not overly complex, but there's a lot to know, and much of it isn't intuitive. Overall, I'd give their user-interface design a rating of 3.\n\nWith the right settings and a good lens, it takes terrific pictures, and the various program modes are well thought out and executed. I have to work pretty hard to take better pictures in manual mode than the camera will select automatically. I thoroughly enjoy the various degrees of manual intervention that are available, though...you can control as few or as many elements as you like, and let the camera make decisions on those elements you don't want to think about.\n\nAs another reviewer stated...the custom white balance process is pretty awkward, although once you get used to it, you can do it quickly. Basically, you have to take a picture of something white, then use the picture file to set the WB. It would be much easier to do it in a single step without taking a picture...just by pointing the camera at the white reference.\n\nIt is very small compared to other DSLR's, and that suits me just fine (although there are folks that don't like it, including a buddy of mine who's a Nikon fan). As a result, it DOES look more like a consumer camera than a pro, but that's not a big deal for me...I'd rather have the convenience that the small size offers.\n\nMy only REAL beef is the kit lens...it's barely passable, and feels very cheap. Manual focus is difficult, because the focusing ring isn't \"tight\" enough to be accurate, It focuses just fine in auto mode, although this is NOT a terribly sharp lens. I've borrowed better Canon lenses from a few friends, and they make HUGE differences in the quality of photos.

Loved my old manual 35mm Nikon SLR, have been using digital point-n-clicks but wanted the control of an SLR again--no major complaints with the Rebel XT. Overall: if you're shopping for a solid DSLR, I'd definitely recommend it.\n\nPros:\n\n+ Fast. I had a miserable time capturing action with my Canon S50 (a digital point-n-click)--response time made for hit-or-miss photos. The XT takes something like 3+ shots/second, a feature I've been happily using for action sequences I could never pull off before.\n\n+ Great depth of field. This was something I really missed from the old SLRs--you just don't get much depth with point-n-clicks even in those portait modes. The XT is great for isolating subjects in the shot.\n\n+ Battery lasts far longer than any other digital cameras I've had (I suspect b/c it lacks the preview window). As a bonus, the XT uses the same form factor as my Canon S50 so I only need one charger when I travel.\n\n+ Auto-focus is v. fast. I know I mentioned speed before but it's worth mentioning again. I hate waiting for other digital cameras to analyze a scene and take a shot--no delays with the XT.\n\n+ Starts up instantly. I didn't think I'd care about this but it's been great--you see a shot, you flick it on and before you can even raise the camera to your eye, it's ready to fire away.\n\n+ Software is better than I expected--it's actually usable as compared to some other software I've received with other cameras like Kodak.\n\nCons:\n\n- The kit lens isn't terrible but isn't great. The manual focus ring is narrow and oddly positioned right at the tip of the lens; and you have to turn-off autofocus to use it (unlike most Canon lenses you can buy). It's also noisy. Aesthetics aside, the optics are ok and the range (from wide-angle to zoom) is hard to find in other Canon lenses (I've found that I've needed separate lenses to get the same wide-angle to zoom range).\n\n- One thing I didn't fully realize when I purchased was the impact of the 1.6 cropping factor of the EF-S lens form factor. The XT can take both EF-S and EF lenses. If you throw on an EF lens (the majority of Canon EOS lenses and what I've purchased for my zoom and primes), the scene is magnified by 1.6 (or you could say the edges are cropped). As I understand it, it allows for a smaller camera. The problem is that you really can't use an EF wide-angle lens since it loses it's wide-angle--you'll need to buy an EF-S wide-angle lens and there aren't many choices (I have the 10mm-22m). My concern is that I'm not sure whether Canon will support the EF-S form factor long-term and I hate investing in lenses only to have them obsolete in a year. Will see what happens. Something to consider since you'll probably be purchasing lenses to go with this camera.\n\n- Get ready to clean the camera more. I'm admittedly rough on my equipment (used the XT in the desert and the jungle). Problem is whereas point-n-clicks are sealed and the old 35mm SLRs would simply capture dust/dirt on single frame, getting a speck on the sensor on the XT (and probably most DSLRs) causes a blob on every shot you take until you notice it during reviews and clean it. I use a hand air pump--takes seconds but just be prepared.\n\n- One final note: be wary of suntan lotion and other lotions when using Canon cameras--I've managed to rub off the decals from two camera bodies so far--the ink or whatever is used to print the icons simply disolves.\n\nI consider these minor issues given the purpose of the camera is to help you take great shots and the Rebel XT definitely does this."},{"reviewerName":"David W.

With the 2 GIG card, I can take over 500 shots before the card fills up and it allows you to take shots you might not take if it were film.\n\nSince electronics has become a part of the camera age, I decided on the RebelXT that would be fine for now and then upgrade to later technology in a few years and STILL have a great lens to use with it.\n\nGood buy, and the lens that came with it takes good pictures, but I can tell the difference in quality from my other lens.\n\nStill, worth the money."},{"reviewerName":"1busymom","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"I picked it back up in 8 years later and remember why I love this camera","reviewDate":"January 17, 2015","reviewText":"My husband bought this for me 8 years ago to start my photography business.

There was no other better DSLR at that time (and still is now as of Sept 2005).

This is the single factor that made me chose the 350D instead of another P&S. Second is the shallow Depth of field (DOF) produced by large aperture lenses (eg the Sigma 30mm f1.4, a truly fantastic lens). If speed and shallow DOF are not what you are after, there is no reason to get a DSLR.\n\nSee pic was taken with the Sigma 30mm at f1.4 to get shallow DOF:\n\n[...]\n\nHope this review helps you to decided!"},{"reviewerName":"Random Techie","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"My first SLR - a review of a different color","reviewDate":"March 15, 2005","reviewText":"I researched this camera and lenses online, and chose it for my first SLR. I have previously have a Nikon 900 and a Nikon 990, both used for web-product photography, currently I have a Nikon 8700.\n\nWhen I went in to buy the XT Rebel, they sold me a filter kit and said \"with these you'll never need PhotoShop.\" That was amusing, since I'm not a photog (I'm a computer person) and I love PhotoShop. According to my online research, the filters can double as a lens protector, so I got them in case I ever felt the need to reach for them. This review is not a performance review of the XT Rebel because I don't know how to use the camera well enough to exercise all its features.\n\nWhat I do wish to convey are the differences between a Nikon 8700 type camera, \"P&S\" (point and shoot), versus my first SLR camera, this Canon XT Rebel. It took me a long time to realize that these constitute two entirely different kinds of cameras.\n\nAutofocus: this SLR has an autofocus capability on steroids. My Nikon takes great photos, on a tripod or if I'm sitting. But should I try something as simple as pointing it at one of the small furry creatures living here too, it generally won't (auto-) focus. And you can't focus it otherwise, really, because you can't tell through the viewfinder or LCD whether it's truly focused, as compared to viewing it on your computer. FINALLY with the XT Rebel I can point it, hold down the snapshot button halfway, and get an instant autofocus. It's like The Terminator locking in on whatever you're pointing at. I am so happy.\n\nA minor difference is that the LCD monitor on the XT Rebel cannot be used as a viewfinder for shooting, you MUST look through the viewfinder. That means smooshing your face up against the back of the camera. I think they sell little viewfinder hoodies to alleviate that.\n\nMemory: this type of camera allows many shots in quick succession, which I have no plans on using. But this is one of the major differences between the two camera types: this XLR has a large amount of memory in the camera body, else it would be impossible to take so many photos so quickly. It takes a while to load large photos onto a CF card. What I don't understand is why manufacturers and reviewers don't list (or figure out) how much memory is in the camera itself...this would seem like a fundamental spec, like the various levels of cache on different CPUs, even within the same product family. It would certainly have helped me catch on much earlier to the differences between the two camera types, if this spec had been waved around at all.\n\nI purchased a Sandisk 1 Gb Extreme III card, which supposedly has a 133X speed rating. But it seems like you don't need that speedy of a card, given the buffer memory in the body of the XT Rebel. You could just buy a cheap 4 Gb IBM microdrive, I think.\n\nZoom: on my Nikon 8700 camera, you push a lever to zoom in or out, with an accompanying SHZZZZZ sound as the lens moves in or out, slowwwly. For the XT Rebel, you grab the zoom part of the lens and twist it. The other part of the lens that can be twisted is the focus part...I'll leave that to photogs. On this XT Rebel the lens does NOT MOVE to autofocus. An internal mechanism inside the lens does that, and very quickly too.\n\nThe Canon lens can have a USM, Ultra Sonic Motor, which means that the internal focusing mechanism is damn fast. Although I bought the kit version in black with the EF-S 18-55mm f3.5-5.6, I haven't used it yet. It turns out the best Canon lenses have an \"L\" designation, so I bought a Canon EF 24-70/2.8 L USM (77MM). The first set of numbers, 24-70, means a zoom range (remember that I'm not a photog ;-), and the \"2.8\" means...well, it's complicated. It's called an \"f-stop\" and means how big the aperture is, or lens opening to feed the pixel sensor. A larger aperture is denoted by a smaller number, and it means the lens is better in low-light situations. This spec is also (annoyingly) called a \"speed\" setting. Indeed, I am annoyed at many of the specs being related to a 35mm film camera, a relic of the previous century. There is an apparent purpose though: as the prices keep coming down and the technology has moore oomph, the consumer digital cameras will finally match the historical ratings of film cameras in some way. That's why there's a \"(77MM)\" spec on that last lens, something to do with comparison to the old film cameras.\n\nThe lens I bought, the EF 24-70/2.8 L USM, is heavy, 2.1 pounds. It totally dominates the camera body, and two hands must be used for a shot, one to grab the lens. The kit is much smaller and probably doesn't require two hands. The next lens I might buy is the Canon EF 70-200 f/2.8L IS USM Lens. The \"IS\" stands for Image Stabilization, which is within the lens itself, and can be toggled on/off.\n\nThe thing about having 8 megapixel cameras is that the slightest movement when shooting might cause a blur. I've been able to hand-hold my new camera-lens for indoor shots with no problem though. The IS in the other lens will help fixup such a problem, like stabilization on a camcorder. Otherwise, use a tripod.\n\nHere are detail pages on the two lens:\n\n[...]\n\n[...]\n\nThe second lens is so heavy that it is the lens that mounts onto a tripod, not the camera!!!\n\nThis is an excellent site for a hard-core review of the XT Rebel / EOS 350D:\n\n[...]\n\nThe Canon Xt Rebel has effortlessly taken great pictures for me, indoors. It hasn't been outside yet.\n\nThe download-directly using USB didn't work for me at first try. I am looking forward to getting that working because it means I won't have to pull the CF card in and out."},{"reviewerName":"Roberto C.

The screen on the back of the camera was well illuminated but the support buttons were not visible at all. While fireworks were blazing i was trying \"fumbling\" to changer my shutter speed and ISO. What canon needs to do to improve this is illuminate all of the buttons on the rebel xt and all of it's cameras so all of the buttons can be seen at night.

Flashes, long exposures, you name it. Just today, the battery life indicator showed one third full.

I don't think I would need another lens anytime soon. It is good for zoom, close ups, etc. I might want a macro lens soon, but other than that, there is really no need to get more lenses. I would recommend a remote (for bulb exposures, etc.), and a UV filter. Also, a tripod is a necessity.

If you're trying to make the decision between an 8 MP and a much more expensive 10 MP SLR, my vote is definitely for the 8 MegaPixel. You won't be disappointed. My only recommendation is that if you are looking for a powerful zoom lens, consider buying just the Rebel XY BODY and a more powerful zoom lens separately, because the 18-55 mm lens that comes with the Rebel--a great lens--does not have very deep zoom.

I bought the Black XT the first week it started selling at Amazon. I researched for several months on which D-SLR to buy, at first I read a lot about avoiding bulky and heavy d-SLRs. So I decided for the XT because it is a newer generation product, seemed small a very light. The camera performed well but mine had a defective flash mechanism, I also noticed a soft focus problem (this has been mentioned in several forums). So I returned to amazon - they gave me a refund after 30 days and I decided not to buy the same product again. IT IS JUST TOO SMALL FOR MY HANDS, I couldnt get a good firm grip on it. So I went to a store and tried the Nikon d70...PERFECT Ergonomic design, so I bought it.\n\nBe careful, go to your local store and see if this camera feels good in your hands.. when buying a d-SLR, you will probably stick with the camera longer that a point-shoot camera, it is essential that you feel comfortable with it. I liked the d70 very much, also the quality of the Nikon kit lens is much more better than the canon kit lens, take that into consideration seriously, just do a search on google for the price of the Nikon 18-70mm lens v.s. the price for the Canon 18-55mm lens.\n\nWhen moving into SLR camera, in future years, you will probably stick with your lenses and just upgrade the body, lens technology does not change as camera bodies do. Battery life is also better on the d70. The XT is still a great camera and a good buy. d70 has a better body finish.

I love this camera, the quality of its picture taking and how very EASY it is to use. For a photography novice like me using a professional grade digital camera like this it is super easy to use. Canon makes great cameras.\n\nHOWEVER....the CFS cards (which is basically the term they use for memory cards) plug into a slot inside the side of the camera. The cards have a series of holes that align into tiny copper prongs inside the camera. It does not take magnetized memory cards like a lot of digital cameras do. Twice I have run into the problem where since I use multiple memory cards and am VERY careful when removing and inserting them-at some point one of the delicate prongs that the card plugs into gets slightly shifted and therefore it would not plug in correctly and completely prevents you from taking or saving pictures unless you get it fixed (You will get a message on the screen saying \"CFS error.\" At first I thought I had purchased a faulty memory card-but soon learned from a representative at Canon that unfortunately it was not the card but when inserting and removing these cards a lot of people have run into this problem--SO I just wanted to warn you all that it can become a MAJOR inconvenience to you if this happens as it can take some time to fix (although it's a simple problem to fix.) The first time it happened to me, I sent it in to Canon's repair center and they had it fixed just as new for FREE because it has a warranty, but it took six weeks. The second time it happened, I took it to a local authorized Canon technician who also fixed it for free since it is still under warranty.\n\nMy advice and what I am going to do is buy a memory card that holds the largest amount of gigabytes possible and just never remove the card so that the prongs will not get compromised. Once the memory card is full-there is no need to take it out to upload the digital images-that is done through an adapter/usb cord. So....I am just going to keep this new memory card inserted indefinitely-upload the photos onto my computer or a CD when it gets full (which takes forever because it takes loads of photos on the 2.0 GB cards even on the highest quality picture taking setting) TO PREVENT THIS PROBLEM FROM EVER HAPPENING AGAIN.\n\nOther than that, I'm in love with this camera and the user guide makes everything so simple and I learn new techniques every time I use it, because it has so many amazing features."},{"reviewerName":"Video Fan","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Awesome camera, right price....happy camper.","reviewDate":"May 18, 2007","reviewText":"I bought this camera and love it.

This is my first SLR, and I am no expert. That being said, this camera is light years ahead of my Canon point and shoot cameras. The pictures are fabulous, both crisp and colorful. The construction seems solid; more so than I was anticipating after reading several reviews. Furthermore, my wife has a medical condition called benign essential tremor (ETS) which makes her hands shake which has compromised her ability to use other cameras. Between the cameras weight and the lens' ability to compensate, she takes perfect pictures with this camera.\nThe battery life is also a positive. I love the LED screen, which give me the information I need (battery life, nubmer of pics, etc.) without having to used the LCD. The camera DOES NOT come with a CF Card. I think that this would have been included, but it is not.\nOverall, I love this camera and would recommend it to anyone."},{"reviewerName":"Nickalina S.

The only problem is it's not nearly as tough as it's film twin. I had the camera less than a month when the pop-up flash quit working. The Canon people have been great, and very helpful, but I'd rather not have had to send a brand new camera back to the factory. The photos, however, are wonderful. Film quality for the most part - printable and enlargable.

I've been using non-DSLRs for four years, and have owned 5 of these. All of the others allow more consistent results than the XT. However, I am relearning my old SLR ways (the hard way). I LOVE the viewfinder and the speed! The housing looks good, but scratches easily. As with all DSLRs, it is exceptionally easy to get dust on the CMOS sensor (and difficult to clean). Sure wish they'd fix this (couldn't they put a charge on the sensor to repel rather than attract dust?)! AWB mode yields varying results (looking at a series of daylight photos taken in different directions seconds apart, it's amazing that some are overexposed, some underexposed, and some have obviously better white balance than others). Wish the ISO extended to 3200.

It is a rebel in terms of its price-value ratio.\n\nSince nothing is perfect in this world, there's no point going on about what is missing in this camera. I found lots of things, including the 8.0 million pixel resolution, that made me happy from the very start. Picture write and read speed is fine, depending on the manufacturer of the card one uses. Focusing is done in a snap (and so far I haven't taken the camera outside from the dusk of my flat to see how it performs in better lighting). Even with the basic kit on, one can easily crop pictures taken at maximum resolution (RAW) to achieve a very good digital zoom (if you do not distinguish between the two types of zoom). Now, invest some money in people selling things for photographers:), and they'll let you have better lenses to take pictures from whatever distance your selected moose or stark naked woman on the beach feels comfortable with your presence.:))\n\nThe software that came with the camera, is easy to use.\n\nAll functions are easy to learn and remember. If not, some reading of the manual and additional material concerning medium-level basics of photography will help settle this dispute between what the camera offers and what you have chosen to learn so far. I don't agree that the camera seems too small. Or is it that some of those complaining about this aspect would still prefer to use the first makes of cellular phones? I doubt that. Smaller buttons is an overall tendency for all types of electronic equipment nowadays. Learn to live and deal with this.\n\nNo complaints whatsoever on my part."},{"reviewerName":"A.

Only Partial-Metering instead ...works ok though\n\nAuto AF point selection often misses intended target. Manual AF point selector helps but annoying to use\n\nAI Servo AF does not work well as advertised, must accompanied with high ISO and shutter speed (1/500th sec or faster)\n\nRelatively weak onboard flash, often needs positive compensation to get the job done\n\nBelow average Auto White-Balance performance\n\nHigh ISO performance is not as good as some professional reviews. Noticeable noise at 800 and above\n\nThe bottom line, Canon Rebel XT/350D is like a well-put-together high-tech toy that invites you to play every time you put your hands on. It's not camera for someone just wants to do point and shoot. To get the best of out this camera requires some learning and adequate accessory...at least one decent lens ($400 and up) and a high capacity/high speed CF card (minimum 1GB and 40x) are absolute necessities. One also must be willing to explore various options this camera provides...ISO setting, Exposure Compensation, White-Balance adjustment, Depth of Field, Creative-Zone photography and RAW shooting are just a few areas worth spending time on."},{"reviewerName":"Horia Paroiu","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"A must have","reviewDate":"January 14, 2008","reviewText":"This camera is simply an excellent photographic tool.

As with any optical device such as cameras, telescopes, etc., the view is only as good as the glass. The 18-55 has its place if you need a lense that you can beat up on. Take it from someone that already bought this product. Buy this camera witout the lense and use the difference to purchase a nice lense separately. I purchased a f/1.8 50mm lense for $100 and the difference between it and the kit lense is amazing.\nThe camera has done everything I have asked of it so far. Nearly professional quality shots are possible with this camera given you have the right lense/glass and know how to use this type of camera.

Allen","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"A review for the","reviewDate":"August 18, 2005","reviewText":"Overview:\n\nCurrent equipment (recently purchased)\n\nCanon Digital Rebel XT (EOS 350D)w/Lens Kit\nCanon Digital Rebel XT \"Starter Kit\" w/Bag, extra battery, haze filter. Do NOT confuse this with the Digital Rebel (non-XT)starter kit, which is also for sale.\nCanon 420 EX Flash\nSanDisk CF Type II (1 GB)\nCanon Semi-hard Case (EH-18L)\nCanon Remote Controller (RC-1)\n\nExperience:\n\nCurrently 34 years old, began taking pictures at age 10 with non-SLR type cameras. Previous cameras include Canon AE-1 Film SLR, Sony Mavica MVC-FD90, Sony Mavica MVC-CD250 and Sony Mavica MVC-CD400. I'd estimate that I've taken 10,000 pictures with film cameras over the years (non-SLR, AE-1, A-1 and F-1, the A-1 and F-1 being bodies owned by my father, who is a well regarded semi-professional photographer and former instructor at the local Community College on film photography)and an additional 10,000 pictures with various digital cameras.\n\nThis is my first Digital SLR purchase.\n\nGeneral Impressions;\n\nMy FIRST recommendation to anyone thinking of purchasing this camera would be to download the owners manual from Canon, it's available via the Canon Website in .pdf format.\n\nSeveral hours of your time spent reviewing the actual manual should provide confidence that this camera can be used effectively by any level of photographer.\n\nIf you're a novice, disregard the \"Manual\" sections of the manual and concentrate your attention on the \"Automatic\" sections. This camera is literally so easy to use a child can take an excellent photograph. I let my 9 year old daughter (with me giving her 2 minutes of advice and observing her carefully to protect the camera as she used it) take 25 photographs in the \"Full Auto\" mode, using only the pop-up flash unit. Out of 25 photos, I would rate 2 excellent on composition and the other 23 very poor (as expected), but the QUALITY of the images was outstanding. Every image was crisp and vibrant. My daughter is a TOTAL novice, other than using a few of the \"disposable\" pre-loaded cameras at a birthday party, these are the first 25 photos she's ever attempted. The 2 of excellent composition (of her little sister who's 2, and was in full \"go\" mode moving around) I sent to my father (who hardly passes out compliments on my photographic skills at a whim)with his response being \"great photos\".\n\nI've personally shot 300 frames with the camera in \"Full Auto\" mode, using no flash (even when one was needed), the pop-up flash unit and the 420 EX (approximately 100 frames each way)and have even tried to \"fool\" the camera by taking portrait type shots in \"Sports\" mode and etc. The camera is very intuitive and will save most users from common mistakes associated with trying to take Photographs as opposed to Snap Shots. The only limitation on the quality of the images you can expect mostly relates to your skills in composing the photographs.\n\nThis camera can be used as a point and shoot camera or can be fine tuned to allow more creative/experienced photographers to push their limits. This is NOT a professional quality Digital SLR (or if it is, I can't imagine a pro using a digital camera, for high end photography this camera has SERIOUS limitations). Having said that, I would recommend this camera to anyone that is comfortable spending the money on it. This is not an inexpensive commitment. Initial outlay for a \"basic\" set-up will run you between 1200 and 1400 dollars, and additional lenses, filters, accessories will add 500 or more dollars (with your budget being the only limit on the \"or more\" amount).\n\nI've read reviews where users mention several \"negative\" issues with the camera. First, some reviewers mention that the battery cover \"rattles\". I can't speak to their experiences, but there is no \"rattle\" on my camera body at all, none. Very solid. Second, I've read complaints that the size is too small. I'm not a small man, and I have fairly large hands. I think the camera IS compact, but not uncomfortable to use. As a matter of fact, the smaller size keeps me mindfull of the fact that it's a precision instrument and that it takes a delicate touch on the shutter and a light \"approach\" to taking a great photo. Finally, I've noticed that some people think the camera has a \"cheap\" feel to it. I can only assume that they're used to camera bodies made of metal. This body is plastic and rubber, but again mine feels very solid in my hands, not \"cheap\" at all, unless I heft my AE-1 right after the fact. But that's comparing apples to oranges.\n\nPhoto Quality:\n\nIn the Large Fine Format, this camera will give you everything you expect in terms of image quality.\n\nEase of Use:\n\nIf my 9 year old can take pictures with it, anyone can.\n\nValue:\n\nRelative to the cost of other Digital SLR's (and having reviewed their owners manuals as well) I'd rate this as a very good value.\n\n5 Star Items:\n\nAutofocus - Very Fast, haven't \"stumped\" it yet.\nMenu - Easy to understand/use\nBattery Life - Excellent\nImage Quality - Excellent\nCanon Engineering - Excellent, I'm biased probably, never had a problem with a Canon Film SLR, don't expect any with a Canon Digital.\nSpeed - Excellent, this camera is FAST. Ready to go.\nErgonomics - Very Very Good, but not perfect.\n\n4 Star Items:\n\nViewfinder - It's very good, the placement of the screen leaves a LOT to be desired, but not enough to downgrade the camera overall.\nCF Slot - Not overly easy to get the card in, but not HARD.\nPop-up Flash Unit - Good for what it is, but nothing you want to rely on if you're planning on taking good photographs in every situation.\nIncluded Software - Very good, nothing earthshaking.\nBattery Charging - Very good, under 90 minutes to take a drained battery back to full charge.\nChanging Lenses - Very good, about what you'd expect.\nOwners Manual - Informative, but could have been better organized.\n\n3 Star Items:\n\nNeck Strap - Poor, not comfortable. Plan on buying a replacment.\nIncluded Lens - Average. Meets the \"general\" purpose shooting requirements for most situations, about what you would expect from a $100.00 lens. Plan on upgrading the lens, but I still recommend buying the full \"kit\" with Lens, instead of body only.\n\nOverall, I gave the camera a 4 star rating, because nothing is perfect, but personally I'm very pleased with my purchase and would recommend this camera to anyone that isn't attempting TRUE professional quality photography.\n\nRecommended purchases;\n\n2nd Battery, 2nd CF Card (recommend Type II), Additional Lenses, Camera Bag, Remote Control, Filters, Flash Unit (420 EX, is cost effective and gives good results, EH-18L Body Case and Tripod.\n\nPotential worthy purchases;\n\nBattery Grip (BG-E3)\nAC Adapter Kit (ACK 700)\n\nAlso, I bought my items directly from Amazon.com, got a good price and everything was delivered on time and in good condition. Just to echo some other reviews, if they price is \"too good\" be wary, as always you get what you pay for.\n\nHope this was helpful information."},{"reviewerName":"Verified Buyer","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Handles Great, Autofocus just not there","reviewDate":"January 18, 2006","reviewText":"First, a couple of things.\n\nI wanted this camera to be great. I researched all the consumer dSLRs and decided on the XT Rebel 350 because of it's size and 8MP CCD, plus, I'd had two Canon point and shoot digitals that were fantastic.\n\nI've been taking pictures on a semi-professtional level for thirty years and I attended Brooks Institute of Photography, so I sort of know what I'm doing.\n\nBought the Rebel XT at a local store in San Francisco, along with the Canon 28-200 Zoom. Immediately went up to Chinatown to shoot pictures of the Festival of the Harvest Moon with my wife, who was using her Nikon D70 with the Nikon 28-200.\n\nShot pictures all day, and absolutely loved the way the XT handled. It was very intuitive, fast, had a bright viewfinder -- I couldn't have been happier.\n\nThen, we got home and looked at the pictures. I'd shot mostly on automatic, or shutter priority all day, with shutter speeds above 250th of a second.\n\nBottom line, my wife's pictures were crystal clear, popped really, and mine of the same or similar subjects were just a tad fuzzy. You couldn't tell at 5x7 or so, but when you brought it up to 8x10 or above the difference was obvious. I checked the historgram on the shots, and they were made at nearly the same settings. Couldn't be, right? After all, the Nikon is only 6 MP, the Canon 8MP.\n\nSo I put both cameras on a tripod, pointed them at a brick wall with a sign about 100 feet away, set everything the same on the cameras, and low and behold, same fuzziness.\n\nI took the Canon back the next day and traded it in on a D70. Now, maybe I got a bad lense, or a camera where the auto-focus was tweaked, but I couldn't afford the time to test it out again and again. I knew the Nikon would work, and it did (and does).\n\nSince then, I've talked to friends, professionals, who say that the XT is known to have auto-focus \"issues\". This seems to be inconsistent, with some reviewers being delighted by the camera, others having a little problem.\n\nAs I said above, the camera handles really well, intuitively, and I actually like the compact size (some SLR users like a heavier camera). I may have gotten a lemon, but if you are going to need to depend on getting sharp pictures and can't go back for reshoots, I'd step up to the Canon D20 or go with a Nikon dSLR."},{"reviewerName":"Chelsea Lynn","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Student Review","reviewDate":"November 6, 2005","reviewText":"The new Canon EOS \"Digital Rebel\" XT offers many of the same exposure features and improvements as the 10D, but slightly scaled back to keep costs under control. The Canon EOS \"Digital Rebel\" XT provides a slightly re-engineered CMOS (Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor - Another imaging system used by digicams. It is not as popular as CCD but the future promises us even better digicams based on CMOS sensors due to the lower amount of power consumption versus the typical CCD device) sensor very similar to that on the Canon EOS 10D, as well as most of the same exposure features.\n\nThe main differences lie in the design of the body. The Canon EOS \"Digital Rebel\" XT makes much greater use of plastic, it has less control over focus or metering modes, also does not have a Custom settings menu, and a handful of other minor changes. The Canon EOS \"Digital Rebel\" XT is an exceptionally small and lightweight camera designed for amateur Digital SLR owners, but it delivers the responsiveness and image quality you'd expect from a semipro model.\n\nWhat's new is a specially designed Canon EF-S lens, designed only for the Digital Rebel, and sold only as part of the Digital Rebel kit. This new lens takes advantage of the size difference between the Rebel's sensor and a normal 35mm film frame to reduce the back-focus distance, shrink the image circle, and shed quite a bit of size, weight, and cost in the process. The biggest draw for the Digital XT is that it offers much of the same functionality as the wildly popular 10D model, but at a much lower price.\n\nAfter personally owning the Canon EOS \"Digital Rebel\" XT for four months, I have found it more useful than a normal pocket digital camera and normal SLR (Single Lens Reflex) camera. This camera is the pinnacle of camera production. We have the capability to create SLR camera media and quality into digital media at your finger tips, with quality results, editable right then and there, and all the while providing the reliability that a normal SLR camera would come with. This camera has also offered up incomparable quality and functionality.

This Canon 350D is a digital replacement for my N75. My family loves Nikon and during my search for a digital camera it was difficult passing over the Nikon D70, but only initially. The size, weight, and feel of the Rebel XT is comparable to my N75. I have small hands and found the D70/D50 and even other Canon SLRs to be too large and quite heavy. I am the sort of person who enjoys bringing my camera everywhere; toss it in a bag or backpack and go. The only real difference in weight now is very minimal, even with the battery pack.\n\nI haven't read the manual yet. The controls are pretty intuitive and fun to play around with. Connection to my PC is pretty simple. I'm not too excited with the Zoom browser software. I'm going to kill it and remove it from my pc soon. It's just a silly interface and I really prefer the simplicity of XP's Explore browser which is sufficient.\n\nThis camera has a USB 2 connection which I don't have yet. I've taken about 200 photos the past 3 days in large format and upload time hasn't been an issue using my 1.0 USB ports. My USB 2.0 PC card will arrive soon and I am looking forward to seeing the difference in speed. I will update my review then.\n\nI bought the body and lens kit.

I hope my experience helps someone with their decision in the pursuit of purchasing a digital SLR regardless whether this is the choice or not.\n----\nUpdate 8/8/05\nI had a month of shooting with this camer. I've taken over 600 shots all in large format without delay due to writing. I have a sandisk Ultra II 1Gb CF. A large percentage of these photos are images of people. There is no shutter delay; quick and responsive focusing to handle the most animated of my friends and even the family cat. I've had no problems shooting indoors in low lighting to a brifght sunny day outdoors. One thing: indoors the flash can be excessive and I tend to turn it off or go manual.\nBattery: Power is eaten up with viewfinder preview. I turn turn off that option.\nUSB 2.0: Nice\nWith all of the reviews I've read about folks manipulating their images after using their d-SLRs I was pretty apprehensive, but I've had no need to do this. Simply learn the different settings that should be used in different environments.\nThere continues to be complaints regarding the size of this camera being too small.

But after a trip to NYC I completely changed my mind and upgraded to the 20D. First was the size: This camera is an ergonomic catastrophy. I did love its light weight feel while slung around my neck, but if you put any other lense on this camera, you will soon find that it will completely off-balance the camera itself and make for an abnormal feel. The case is just too small for me for an SLR. I also couldn't stand the cheap feel of the casing. Hold it next to a 20D and you'll see what I mean. For anyone getting into digital SLR photography I would recommend paying the extra $500 for the model above the XT...20D. Its just as easy to use as the XT, but with MUCH MORE POTENTIAL! Why buy a camera with limited capabilities, even if you are a beginner? By the way, we all know its the LENSE that takes the picture, the camera just processes the information. You will never be sorry buying good L line lenses over the cheap stuff with so-so reviews. I used the 17-40mm L with the XT and it took unbelievable pictures, no question. I'm for sure keeping the lense.\n\nIn summary; the camera has good but limited features, and with the L lense took amazing pictures, but the petite size and cheap feel didn't work for me."},{"reviewerName":"X.

I've found both in the Canon Rebel XT.

I've found this camera to take excellent pics while not overwhelming me with a lot of extra buttons or features that I won't use. My only complaint about the camera itself is the lens that came with the camera. The zoom on the camera is virtually non-existent and I found this to be a little frustrating now that I realize I will have to spend several hundred more dollars for a good zoom lens.

Seems everything BEHIND your subject winds up being in perfect focus. This is especially frustrating since I replaced the cheap 18-55mm \"kit\" lens with an expensive Canon \"L\" series, 24-70 f2.8 macro-zoom lens. Unless you use the \"creative-zone\" and choose only the center area (or point) of the cross-shaped, seven area focus sensor, don't plan on getting a properly focused picture. Apparently Canon realized THERE'S A PROBLEM with the EOS 350D's focus system, because the new EOS 400D (Rebel XTi) comes with a different sensor; it's the same highly accurate, nine-point \"diamond\" shaped focus sensor that's found on the considerably more expensive, professional grade EOS 30D.

I bought a second one to be able to exchange, but one battery is good for about two days and hundreds of pictures on a lower level of pixels. The camera comes without a memory card and I have bought a 4 GB SanDisc compact flesh card which has two sections of 2 GB each that you can use.

For someone unfamiliar with SLRs, this is a good starting camera.\n\nThe downside is equally simple: Canon Rebels don't last forever. I don't find it much fun to hold a camera with a plastic body, and it may be nerve-wracking to know that one minor drop could render your camera broken and useless.

Here's the problem. You can take good photos with anything, if you are careful, hold the camera steady or use a tripod and know how to make a photograph interesting. Years ago, I bought an Agfa ePhoto 1680. The lens on this camera was wonderful. I have 8x10's that are grainless and perfect which were taken at the equivilent of 1.8 megapixels. No one would ever think they were made with a digital camera. I was careful not to exceed the contrast range of the sensor and the camera was on a tripod. It's not resolution that makes a great picture, it's the picture that makes a good picture. It's the technique and equipment that fade into the background to go unnoticed when a photograph is well executed.\n\nOK, back to the Rebel XT. Mine arrived and could not deliver a sharp image. I tried everything but the camera was somehow malfunctioning. I sent it back to Canon and 2 weeks later I recieved it back... fixed. Now the images are sharp.\n\nDecided to compare this to film, used my EOS A2E with Kodachrome 64 to photograph landscapes on a beautiful summer day. Soft light, tripod, beautiful conditions a sky filled with small puffy clouds, perfect. I made six exposures then switched cameras to the Rebel XT. Same 6, carefully exposed and checked.\n\nI had chromes back in 3 days, decided to print one at a local lab. I made a 16x20. I then sent a raw file from the Rebel XT to a well known mail order lab and also received a 16x20 of the same basic exposure.\n\nTwo friends come over, I show the first the digital print. They were impressed, it came from a digital camera and didn't look \"digital\" what ever that means. Then I pulled out the K print, silence... \"wow.\" I asked what the difference was, they couldn't articulate what that was. I studied the two as carefully as possible, I think I can explain it. In the smallest branches and twigs, the digital broke up, couldn't handle the detail. The Kodachrome handled the detail with ease.\n\nHere's what I think. Digital cameras are wonderful for making photos without film. Yet film is good at high resolution down to the size of silver halide crystals.\n\nTheoretically, 12 megapixels is about where you reach the limit of film. When you get to 18 megapixels, you are able to deliver medium format quality, that's where it really starts getting interesting."},{"reviewerName":"smurf82","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"A great camera","reviewDate":"March 16, 2007","reviewText":"I did A LOT of research before getting this camera.

For anybody who has the patience to learn how to use a dslr, you won't be hampered by this body. It even has AI-Servo mode, which was a good enough reason for me to upgrade from my Digital Rebel alone, as I shoot ice hockey when I can. Conversely, I don't think it's overladen with features. It lacks a spot meter for example. Bob, do us all a favour and never pick up a professional camera, as you'll moan about \"too many features\" for weeks.\n\nSecondly, of course you can't use the lcd as a viewfinder! It's an SLR! There's a great big mirror in the way!\n\nMacro mode? You claim to have used an SLR before? Surely with all your experience you're using aperture priority and mirror-lock up at the very least with your macro photos? The macro performance is based purely on the lens you use and its close-focusing distance. The tiny lenses you find on compact digitals are suited to macro photography due to their tiny focal length and hence large depth of field. An SLR lens will never be able to focus as close, unless it's designed for macro work.\n\nIt seems to me that you're not very experienced and don't understand how your camera works, nor the differences between compact and slr cameras.

Eventhough I love my old digital rebel with upgraded firmware, i think I want to add this to my canon collection rather than 20d. Since I do this for my wedding business, the one thing I was impress was is the E-TTL II function. Even if you point the camera for closed up picture, the flash from the camera will fire evenly. It didnt put it to one spot where it's focusing, which is great. I think it works like I-TTL balanced fill flash with Nikon D-70. Flash and wedding is a tough job to conquer. You think you know it, you have no idea that flash fotography is challenging. THat's why you we get paid thousands to have excellent picutres come up with $1k camera. hehehehe...... I only use a cheapo but wonderfully work Sigma EF-500 DG SUPER. Awesome flash!!!\n\nThe camera just a little small to hold and a bit not looking pro at all. But i,m gonna add the battery grip BG-E3 for better grip and pro look to it expecially when i add that zoom lens. besides, the battery grip will accept 2 proprietary batteries or 6 AA which i love. only costing me $12.99 for 6 2100mah batteries at costco rather than spending $45 more each for specific battery, which i forget what it is.\n\nBut all in all, the camera is awesome, will work magic to someone's wedding. You don't have to go 20D for extra $500.00. Stick with this one, only missing 2 extra focusing point and some software controlled functions and no PC sync. Other than that, Quality just as the same.

It's not a brand new model, if you are not on budget, take a look to successors Canon Rebel XTi 10.1MP or newest Canon Rebel XSi 12MP or, if you don't want Canon, try other brands like Nikon and etc, which I believe also provide the same quality (for the same price)."},{"reviewerName":"Lori Mchughes","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"happy BUT>>>>>>","reviewDate":"June 21, 2008","reviewText":"happy happy happy happy BUT I have a hardware problem, the flash lid is not popping up and give an error sign.

Tiene 5 puntos de enfoque que se pueden manipular para lograr efectos muy buenos, y una rafaga de disparos continuos de unos 12 disparos en unos 2a3 seg. Como detalle tambien les aclaro que el lente ef-s 18-55 que trae se queda corto para hacer acercamientos entonces tengan por seguro que tendran que adquirir otro lente.

Not just flash but no photos at all. When I got to the statue of David, I was not leaving until I got a picture. With the camera set on AV priority I politely took a seat on a bench as though I was tired, and with a little care in positioning and being very still I clicked off nearly half a dozen shots. Out of those I did find one that was not blurred and was reasonably composed. The exposure was perfect and what little camera noise there was, was negligble. As a matter of fact, I was not disappointed with any of the pictures I had to take without flash. There were a number of instances during daylight where the camera would flip up the flash. I could not understand this until I tried to bypass the electronics by switching to manual and found the picture was much better with the flash than without.

Totally satisfied!","reviewDate":"March 24, 2005","reviewText":"I purchased this camera a few days ago, and I like it more and more with each passing day. When I first held the camera in the store, I did not like the smallness of the camera. I have average sized hands, but the camera still felt too small. I have the original Canon Rebel, which always felt good in my grip. I purchased the Xt despite the size (i am a megapixel junkie) and I am glad that I did.\n\nThis camera is small, but mighty. It is fast, sleek and caputres colors and subtle shadows flawlessly. I settled on the silver finish, which looks classy and solid. The original Rebel, although comfortable to hold, always looked a bit cheap, and too plastic like. The new Xt does not. I have yet to make an enlargement, but I am confident that I can go up to 16x20 inches without feeling a loss of quality.\n\nI am a high school art teacher with a degree in photography, so I have developed an eye for color and texture over the years. I am very demanding of my photographic equipment. I know that I will not be dissappointed with the Rebel Xt.\n\nI use a 512K memory card, which is on the small size, but does not seem to slow down the camera at all. I am delighted with this purchase. Considering the price difference between the Rebel Xt, and the Canon 20D, it does not make sense to spend $500.00 more for 1/2 a megapixel difference. I wouldn't be surprised if the Xt out performs and out sells the 20D. So, my advice is BUY this camera. It is lightweight, fast, sleek and delivers impressive results."},{"reviewerName":"R.

Called Canon tech support, who ran me through a few things to try and then told me I'd have to send it to a repair center. Went through the holidays with a borrowed digital so as to no have to dust off my Canon Elan and use film. Paid [...] to ship my digital to Canon, and finally TODAY I received a letter in the mail (have they not heard of email or even the telephone???) that is a standardized form for repair with a minimum [...] fee - they have not even looked at my camera yet.\n\nWhy could Canon not have told me that would be the minimum cost when I called tech services and got the shipping info and asked if they had any idea on repair charges?? Why couldn't they have said \"ship it with a $211.65 check to...\" This camera cost [...] when I bought it. Am I wrong to think a $900 camera should last more than 14 months??\n\nConsidering that the cost of a new body is not much more than the minimum repair price I am EXTREMELY unhappy with this situation. On top of this, when I called to discuss it with them today the only consolation I was offered was - they will ship it back for free if I don't have it repaired.

It is a great camera and everyone loves it. It has a ton of features. I bought this camera and here are a few things that I didn't easily find out when researching it that you may find helpful.\n\n1. You cannot see an image on the LCD before you take you picture. So you look through the eyepiece like a regular camera. At first I didn't like this since I was used to the Sony 828 model. But now I am used to it and don't mind it at all.\n\n2. You can take pictures considerably faster than similar cameras like the Sony 828. If you have the faster memory card you can take pictures nearly as fast as a regular camera. This is one of the first things Sony owners noticed when using my camera.\n\n3. This camera is more complicated than a Sony model. Having knowledge of photography and settings is extremely helpful.\n\n4. The flash on this camera compared to the Sony 828 doesn't seem to be as good.\n\n5. The software that comes with this camera is EXTREMELY bulky. Just getting the images off my camera to my computer is a major chore. Many times it starts to download them but then hangs etc. I need to have a full battery usually to get a few hundreds pictures transferred. The software is a real drag. There are some cool features of the software, but overall since it is so bulky and slow it really would make me consider a different camera in the future. I would recommend buying a memory card reader if you buy this camera.\n\nSo basically this is a great camera that takes great pictures. It is very responsive and works as it says. It is upgradeable with lenses and is probably the closest thing you can get to a real camera. But Canon really has to spend some more time making their software responsive and work better. I give a 4 star rating only because of the software given with this camera. The Sony 828 when hooked up to a computer will show up like a drive and you can easily copy the pictures to your hard drive. You can not do this with the Canon unless you install their drivers."},{"reviewerName":"Jeffrey G.

I love this, my first SLR, camera. It's fast, takes big bright sharp pictures and has more features than I can imagine using right now. I'd recommend it to anyone looking to upgrade to an SLR from a point and shoot. Obviously, a pro would be limited by this camera, but not, yet, a regular user like me.

Just a quick skim over the manual and I was off on my way. The power of this camera will come when I take the time to RTFM (Read the fine manual). The two pictures that I took where the main subject was blurry were due to my not understanding how the camera works, but all of the items in the background were clear. Pictures taken in a very dark room came out perfect. I snapped 43 pictures yesterday and look forward to taking many more.\n\nI purchased a lot of accessories with mine and purchased some more today due to not fully understanding all of the parts that I received. I originally purchased the Canon EH-18L Semi-Hard Case. This case is fine when you're out and about with the camera taking pictures, but does not hold anything other than the camera with lens.\n\nToday I purchased the Canon Accessory Starter Kit for Digital Rebel XT (Includes 200DG Bag, NB-2LH Battery & 58mm Haze Filter) This way I can put my battery charger, the Canon BG-E3 Battery Grip, spare batteries and lenses all in the same place."},{"reviewerName":"s2mone","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"canon","reviewDate":"July 11, 2007","reviewText":"I love this camere from the minute I got in my hands.

Wimberley: The Digital Rebel XT is equipped to detect whether you're shooting horizontally or vertically. To do so, there may be a free-hanging piece within the camera to detect which way is up as you hold the camera. This may be what's making the rattling sound.\n\nThe sensor is handy, as the camera uses this data to auto-rotate images in the viewfinder for you when they were shot vertically."},{"reviewerName":"superman2k3","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Best selling D-SLR series!","reviewDate":"March 14, 2005","reviewText":"Canon has fully redesigned the Digital Rebel XT series to make it lighter, smaller, better and even more feature loaded.\n\nPro's,\n1. Excellent image quality.\n2. Faster than any P&S digicam out there. No perceptible shutter lag!\n3. Can change your lens. That may not seem anything new to SLR folks but the P&S crowd has been buying gazillion-MP $500+ digicams with crappy fixed lens.\n4. Large image sensor compared to 7MP Sony's or other XMP digicams. Gives you better picture quality and colors.\n5. Priced right, unlike some overpriced D-SLR out there, probably because Canon sells many more units.\n6. The menu on the Canon cameras is light years ahead of most other manufacturer's. Lots of manual options and image processing features.\n7. LCD screen is bright and fluid, although it doesn't use any new technology like OLED etc.\n8. Uses standard CF cards, unlike propretary memory cards like Memory Stick or xD card. You can buy 1GB for an affordable price.\n9. Lots of lens & accessory options from Canon and other vendors.\n\nCon's,\n1. The camera is still quite heavy and big. I guess that will remain so for most D-SLR's, for a while atleast.\n2. Not for professional use, only prosumer quality.\n3. Quite an expensive camera, out of reach of most people (unlike film SLR's). When other manufacturer's get it right, the price should fall significantly.\n4. LCD screen could have been bigger for such a bulky camera.\n5. Wish they come up with a way to show approximate picture for framing on LCD before shooting. Viewfinder is too cumbersome & old fashioned.\n\nI am almost sure Rebel XT will be THE best selling D-SLR of 2005, just like original Rebel in 2004. Ofcourse depending on your lens collection and requirements there are very good offerings from Nikon and Pentax too. But compared to original Rebel this a nice improvement and highly recommened.

Also, the color is great on canon dSLR's, you obviously don't know how to control custom WB/saturation (you need to take a photo of a white piece of paper or card at the location and then \"set\" it as yor custom WB). Next is the fact that you used the kit lens. Don't blame the body for a cheap lens (although I think its decent for the wideangle). Finally, the dust on the sensor is your fault. you obviously don't know how to check and clean your camera. if you want a sealed-tight dSLR, you have to spend thousands.\n\nMy advice for you is to stick with point and shoot. You're not ready for dSLR."},{"reviewerName":"Dave","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Good (and Bad) First DSLR Experience","reviewDate":"March 20, 2005","reviewText":"Pros:\nNearly instant power-on. Extremely fast focusing with kit lens AND sharp pictures at all focal lengths. Fast multiple-frame shots (3 fps) even with slow (4x) CF card. Low image noise at high ISO settings (vs. non-SLR digital cameras).\n\nCons:\nFull Auto Exposure setting predominantly uses ISO 400 (instead of ISO 100) even in bright sunlight. No ability to frame shot using LCD (major SLR shortcoming). Focus screen and mirror dirty after just 3 days use (major SLR shortcoming). Small LCD which is difficult to see in bright sunlight. No retaining strap on lens cover.\n\nDetailed Review:\nI purchased Canon Digital Rebel XT with kit lens and 75-300mm f/4.5-5.6 IS USM telephoto lens a week ago and have shot a wide variety indoors and outside with both lenses - 350 pictures total. The ability to change lenses and low noise at high ISO settings were the primary reasons this long-time non-SLR digital camera user purchased his first DSLR. The very good reported user experiences with the original Canon Digital Rebel, the availability of the new 8.2 megapixel Rebel XT for US$999, and a reasonable total user package price of $1500 after adding an image-stabilized Canon 75-300mm USM telephoto lens clinched the deal. With these two lenses I can cover a 35mm equivalent focal range of 27mm to 480mm and shoot clear, hand-held outdoor shots over entire range at ISO 100-400. Indoor telephoto shots up to 480mm are possible without flash, but I find ISO must be increased to 800 or 1600 for sharp hand-held shots.\n\nVery happy with the image quality of kit 18-55mm EF-S lens and the very fast focus times of this non-USM lens. It is also very light weight. I have found I mostly use Program exposure mode, since I can control the ISO setting, white balance mode, etc. I'm not happy with Full Auto Exposure mode choosing ISO 400 for outdoor shots in full sunlight (and all other shots). Why not use ISO 100? Granted, there is no noise visible in outdoor ISO 400 shots until you zoom in on monitor-displayed image and the noise is not visible in 8x10 prints from my Canon i950 8-color printer except in shadows. Using ISO 100 in Program mode mostly eliminates this shadow noise. I have found the A-DEP exposure mode useful for ensuring wider depth of field and sharp exposures, especially for telephoto shots. I have experienced more than a few grossly underexposed indoor flash pictures under fluorescent lighting (5-15 foot range) in Full Auto Exposure mode. Not sure what the problem is.\n\nOverall, however, I have been very pleased with the quality of the majority of pictures taken so far including: macro shots, portraits, landscape photos, flash macro shots (no camera shadow), indoor flash pictures, and telephoto (all hand-held). Camera is ready-to-go the instant you turn it on. Can review pictures immediately on pressing review button and zoom in up to 10X. LCD can be hard to see (both pictures and camera settings) in bright sunlight. Increasing LCD brightness to maximum helps. Viewfinder is bright and clear (duh, it's TTL optical) with good eye relief for eyeglass wearers.\n\nAfter an hour of outdoor shooting in windy conditions yesterday, however, a major problem developed. The focus screen located inside the top of the camera body AND the internal mirror got contaminated with dust and yellow tree pollen. I only had the internal camera body exposed for maybe 90 seconds total during the course of 4 lens changes. I was able to get the mirror clean but I could not completely clean the focus screen - it's impossible to access with the dust blowers I have. If I cannot keep camera internals clean over course of 3 days, what will happen over 6 months or a year of use? What if the digital sensor gets dirty? Also, I find the inability to use the LCD to frame pictures BEFORE taking them to be a BIG negative. YES, I realize this is a \"feature\" of SLR cameras, but it still sucks. For these two reasons, and the small LCD that is nearly unusable outdoors in bright sunlight, the camera has been returned. Guess I'm not cut out for a digital SLR. For those that are - the Canon Digital Rebel XT is a fine camera, and I can highly recommend the 75-300mm f/4.5-5.6 IS USM lens.\n\nI also advise \"try it - before you buy it\" if this is possible, and definitely don't buy from a store that does not allow \"no-questions-asked\" \"no restocking fee\" returns for some period of time after purchase (2-4 weeks)."},{"reviewerName":"Michael F Delineate","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"digital rebel xt","reviewDate":"February 25, 2006","reviewText":"i owned a plain digital rebel and upgraded to the xt.\n\ni am just getting used to the new one now. my pictures are much better (8mps)vs 6 i have noticed that my file size is much larger when i switch from RAW to TIF. i had to do al lot of work to get canon's camera raw to work in my photoshop application. when i called canon they were absolutely no help. i finally went onto the adobe site and got a plug-in to enable me to use the camera's cr2 files in photoshop. i'll be frank, i don't know why the camera manufacturers are not using a standard camera raw. photoshop wants me to save everything in their dng type file, but my favorite sharpening program(Dx0 pro optics 3.5)can handle the canon raw but not the adobe dng. so i don't know what to do except to save my canon cr2, adobe dng, and my DxO raw files. i spend more time than i should erasing files from my system."},{"reviewerName":"A.

The new DR XT is quite different. Even though it's 3 ounces lighter than the original DR -- mostly due to the use of a smaller battery; see below -- its smaller form factor actually makes it feel more solid and \"real\". In other word, unlike the original DR, this one feels professional, not toy-like at all.\n\nBy now you probably already know Canon makes some of the best digital cameras in the world. Even though I'm a Nikon shooter when it comes to d-SLR (sorry, loyal Canon shooters!), I own a couple Canon compact digital cameras and love them, too. The DR XT's image quality is once again excellent. I took a few indoor shots with the camera, both with and without flash, and then the store clerk let me download them to their PC. The JPEG pictures (I didn't try RAW) looked excellent on the Sony LCD screen, on par with the more expensive EOS 20D d-SLR. Color tones were accurate and the resolution was really good. The improvement picture quality over the original DR (\"DR Classic\"? BTW it's now $200 cheaper) comes from both the 2 extra megapixels and the better color accuracy. BTW, the DR XT reportedly uses a tecchnically different CMOS sensor than the original DR, although I haven't been able to find out exactly how this one is better in technical terms than the old one (other than the two extra megapixels). No matter, my limited true-world testing showed the image quality is indeed better than the already-excellent image quality of the original DR. And, as in the past, Canon does a wonderful job at keeping noise low -- I considered noise acceptable up until ISO 800.\n\nThe kit, which I recommend, comes with the same flimsy 3x EF-S lens (which won't work on regular film SLRs) as the original DR. You should most definitely get a better lens, although the kit lens works well as a \"street zoom.\" I didn't get a chance to test the lens outdoors as the store wouldn't let me take it outside, but I have no doubt that this new model can only be better than the original DR, which was already very good even before you considered its low price.\n\nThe DR XT is fast: at last, you can turn it on and start shooting without waiting several seconds like you had to with the original DR. The only downside compared to the original DR is the smaller, lighter battery in the DR XT also means shorter battery life. I highly recommend you get an extra battery or two. You won't be able to go through a full day of shooting on just one battery, even if you don't use flash much. (But all pros and pro-wannabes use fill-in flash, don't we?) I also recommend a good camera bag; I personally like Tamrac for that. In addition to the spare battery (batteries), bag and a better lens or two, also consider getting a tripod (Sunpak ones are cheap but ok quality), an external flash as well as filters -- esp. a high-qual circular polarizing filter.\n\nIn summary, the Canon Digital Rebel XT is another stunning winner from Canon. It features faster speeds (start-up and shot-to-shot), excellent image quality, and terrific look-and-feel. Despite my personal preference for Nikon pro-level gear, I can recommend this Canon d-SLR to my friends without reservation.\n\nFeel free to e-mail me at gadgester @t hotmail with your questions and commends."},{"reviewerName":"Jason","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great Product!","reviewDate":"November 10, 2011","reviewText":"Great camera, would definitely recommend to anyone thinking of purchasing one.

E-mail one of these vendors, ask them why their prices are so low? You will most likely get a response about \"my little secret\", \"direct form the factory\", \"very limited offer\" - Sucker lines. Also notice that people selling these items are \"just launched\" with no reviews, and an e-mail address on yahoo or similar easy setup account. I would not trust a $500 purchase to a \"just launched\", mayby $5 but no more.\n\nIn response to the Digital Rebel XT, I don't have mine yet, on order but have played around with one yesterday, positive details all over the web if you want a quality review. For the money it is a great buy, wont be perfect but if you want perfect you will need to spend $2000 plus, so all in all this is going to be a popular DSLR.

I've been looking at the feature upgrades of the XT for some time and finally decided to sell my old camera and buy this one. After one day of use I sent to back and cancelled selling my old one:\n\nCon:\n\nThis is made for very tiny hands. I wear a men's medium glove because they are too small for the \"one size fits all\". I was shocked at how small your hands need to be to comfortably hold the unit. My wife was equally disappointed. I tried 2 approaches:\n\nIt is comfortable with 2 hands. This is how I shoot when I have my heavy lenses and external flash installed. However I only sport this at events I know I will shoot a lot. When I am at home or take the kids out, I want my light lens and shoot with only one hand (corralling the kids with the other).\n\nUse one hand. There are 2 positions this will work, my grip was strong when I slid my thumb far to the left to \"create shorter fingers\" but I found it difficult to press the trigger. In a normal position my grip was loose and I tended to droop the camera counter-clockwise.\n\nPros:\n\nEverything else you've read is true. The body is slightly more professional, the burst rate is noticeably faster and the buffer is larger. The higher ISO quality is amazing. Choosing the ISO/WB is not much more tedious, but I agree that in sunlight this is a chore. I do also notice the LCD is more blurry since I got used to reading it straight on using the original, you need to hold it at an angle. The menus are just as intuitive as the original. FEC is a big win.\n\nIt is clear to me that the original Rebel neutered features via Firmware to upsell the equivalent quality 10D and this time the grip is the incentive to buy the 20D."},{"reviewerName":"Michael A.

We live overseas, but in and APO address. For those who do not know, that means our mail is still US mail and operates just the same, with the exception of needing to fill out a customs form, which includes the senders name/address, the receivers name/address, the value of the item and what it is. It takes 5 minutes tops. We also have to compete with the fact that lithium batteries cannot be shipped through mail to us. When I contacted this seller to see if the battery could be left out for shipping so my son could purchase, the answer was not an issue with the battery, but rather with the paperwork and time that was involved in shipping this product here. Five more minutes was not worth the $220 for this seller and that is disappointing. The market over here is huge for camera purchases, as we can buy on the economy in Euro which is quite expensive or through a military store, which is not always a good deal for us. We are often taking trips when free time allows to places like Paris, Italy, wherever and cameras are much needed.

Towards the end of the day, I powered it down and it never came back on. Tried the \"dry it out\" regimen in the user's guide, no luck. It became \"luggage\" for the rest of the trip. Used my trusty 4.1MP Sony DSC-S85 after that. I'm sure its my fault, but ... you know ... I didn't handle it with any less care than 5 other cameras I've owned. Sent it to Canon for repair ... they said moisture exposure is not covered under the warantee. Gave me a $MANY estimate to repair. Grumble, grumble.

I had a Powershot Pro1 and I thought the Rebel XT was going to be an upgrade from the Pro1. So far I have taken over two hundred pictures, side by side, using both the XT and the Pro1. For each picture I used the same settings within the choosable range for both cameras. I have taken pictures in the evening, in the night when the light is very dim, and in a sunny morning in the outside. I set the focal length at 200 mm on the Pro1 and 130 mm on the XT, which were almost exactly equivalent. After I took the pictures I came inside and open them with Microsoft Digital Image Pro to compare side by side the pictures of the same objects taken by the two cameras. Without fail, when auto focus was used for both cameras, the Pro1 produced much sharper images and a much better depth of field. When I switched to manual focus, though, the XT did produce razor sharp image with full details. I am impressed with the speed of the Rebel XT as compared to the Pro1. But I do not want to focus manually all the time. My decision is to stick with my Pro1 and return the XT tomorrow. One word to the Canon engineers, finally. You guys are idiots, wasting such a good camera with such a lousy auto focus accuracy."},{"reviewerName":"A.

Nienhuis","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"How a simple sensor cleaning ended up in a nightmare.","reviewDate":"June 5, 2006","reviewText":"About four months ago I purchased the Canon Digital Rebel XT 8MP Digital SLR Camera. Additionally I bought two professional zoom lenses. The basic EF-S 18-55mm that came with the camera was not sufficient for me to fully utilize the camera. After the first time use I noticed a stain on the pictures. Changing different lenses can cause dust in the sensor area. The instructions for use suggested the sensor cleaning procedure. So I did but the stain did not go away. Furthermore the stain did not seem to be dust but an oil stain of some sort. I contacted the Canon service department and they told me that sensor cleaning warranty was only within the first six months after the date of purchase. I decided not to mail the camera but bring the camera myself to a Canon service centre. At the Canon service centre I learned how to clean the sensor myself but I also learned that my little stain was a serious problem. Somehow during the manufacturing process an oil stain accumulated between the filter and the sensor. Thus the camera had to stay at the Canon service centre and would be mailed to me after it was repaired. The Canon service centre promised to prioritize the repair. After one week I received a box in the mail and I was surprised that expensive and sensitive SLR cameras were shipped in tinny single layer boxes. My surprise was even bigger when I discovered that my camera was not even in the box. The Canon service centre has send me a Powershot instead that belonged to another customer. What happened to my SLR camera is a mystery and I am still waiting to receive a new camera. My recommendation do not buy this end-of live Canon Digital Rebel XT8MP until Canon takes more care in customer service and in particular in case warranty is claimed."},{"reviewerName":"Bob Dobolina","rating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"I Hate This Camera","reviewDate":"February 13, 2006","reviewText":"In my opinion, this camera suffers from a couple of serious problems that makes it an extremely poor choice for anyone looking for a professional-level DSLR:\n\n1). It's trying to be too many things to too many levels of photographer. Canon is clearly going for the consumer/semi-professional/professional market. In my opinion it turns a potentially great camera into an expensive gadget. Too many features, too many menu options, too many automatic modes--in short, too much of everything. Imagine buying a car that has manual AND automatic transmission and is a combination hard-top/rag-top convertible with disc and drum brakes front and back, an AM/FM radio, CD player, cassette player, 8-track tape player, reel-to-reel player, record player, and a 16-track digital recording studio. \"Cool!\" you say? Buy this camera right now. I'm looking for a good quality DSLR to replace my standard SLR. This camera has way too many gee-whiz features designed to appeal to the consumer market. It makes it a pain in the arse to use--unless you want those features, of course. I don't.\n\n2). You can't use the display as a viewfinder. This is a huge deal-killer, in my opinion. One of the great advantages of a digital camera is the ability to use the onscreen display for setting up your shots. I understand they're trying to maximize battery life, but a digital camera where you CAN NOT use the display while you're shooting is absurd.\n\n3). Terrible macro mode. Not just average. Terrible. You definitely need an optional macro lens in order to take decent macro photos with this camera. Otherwise, you're going to be stuck with Canon's bizarre decision to force the use of flash in macro mode (you get to choose between no flash mode or macro mode in the auto settings (but not both(?)) or manual mode with an optional lens). Buying a closeup lens for a high-end camera is reasonable to expect, I suppose, except that I've never run into this problem with ANY other digital camera I've used. Most are great for quick-and-dirty macro photography right out of the box.\n\n4). The dumbest manual white-balance procedure I've ever seen in my life. Use it. I dare you.\n\n5). Incredibly lousy manual. Standard feature for ALL cameras these days, I know. Doesn't excuse the fact, however.\n\nDon't get me wrong, this is a GREAT camera that takes excellent pictures and works as advertised. It just not anywhere close to what I was looking for. Canon could have skipped 80% of the features and simplified a few others and I would have kept this camera. For now, I'll stick to my Sony DSC-H1 for snaps and my trusty old Nikon and Canon F-1 for the rest."},{"reviewerName":"daniel32","rating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"do not buy this!!","reviewDate":"March 30, 2005","reviewText":"I have had an EOS Elan Canon SLR 35mm for years and was very excited to get the digital equivalent when the Rebel XT came out. I brought the camera with me to the desert in S. Calif during this past wildflower bloom. I figured it would be the perfect camera for the variety of colors on display now in the desert.\n\nI cannot describe my disappointment with the camera. First of all, the camera quickly got a small amount of dust on the sensor (even without removing the lens) and ruined most of my pictures. I could remove it with Photoshop, but I don't want to go through that for the nearly 2000 pics that I took.\n\nAdditionally, the color was horrible. I get better color from my Canon s400 elph. I tried using AV,Program mode, manual, landscape....all of them were problematic. Also, many of the pics were washed out.\n\nThe main problem is the stock lens that comes with the camera. it is a very slow f3.5 lens. junk. buying a faster lens adds another grand to the total price.\n\nother sources of irritation: cannot use lcd screen to take pics. results in using the viewfinder and your nose squished up against the lcd screen.\n\nI am returning this tomorrow."},{"reviewerName":"A.
