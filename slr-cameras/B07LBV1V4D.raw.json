I could not possibly be happier with the way it zooms and sharply autofocuses precisely on the moving target I'm trying to get a photo of! All of the accessories are outstanding and will be put to use too. Delivery was days sooner than expected and that was very much appreciated! The price was right as well, I couldn't be happier and glad I didn't wait any longer!"},{"reviewerName":"Crystal Creasy","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great Bundle for Beginners","reviewDate":"June 3, 2019","reviewText":"I’m very excited to finally find and decide on a great camera bundle! I got everything that came in the bundle to fit in the camera bag except for the cleaning kit (which I could probably get to fit but I decided to leave it all in it’s original box) and the tripod of course (which comes in its own case). I haven’t really got the chance to play with all that the camera is capable of doing, but I can’t wait to start using it more and advance my photography skills. It was a little difficult to use at first but got easier as I got to play around on it. There’s still a lot to learn of course so I also purchased the “Canon EOS Rebel T7 for dummies” to go along with my bundle. The last two pictures I provided were both taken with this camera, the quality is great and the camera is lightweight and easy to hold. So if you’re having a hard time deciding on a bundle, this is a great one to go with. The only thing I’m not too thrilled about is that this bundle only comes with 1 battery so I also purchased an extra battery pack to go along with it."},{"reviewerName":"kristin","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Easy to use, patience to understand","reviewDate":"May 27, 2019","reviewText":"I am still learning how to use it because there are alot of different settings but this is a wonderful camera! Everything came that was promised with it. The picture quality is beautiful and the actual ease of switching out lenses is simple. I would recommend it but be prepared to actually read the manual to receive the best quality photo for different events or scenery."},{"reviewerName":"chib","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great package deal for a really great camera and goodies!","reviewDate":"July 30, 2019","reviewText":"This is my first DSLR... I'm old school. Not much use for my old Pentax K1000, didn't find a Pentax to my liking so I could use my lenses. Transitioning from a point and shoot 4 megapixel camera. Can't wait to see what I can shoot with all the optional lenses and filters! Canon is a nice product. It's great that this package comes with actual Canon lenses- not knock-offs. Curious how the wide angle and macro lens will perform (not Canon). The only thing I would have invested in is a better tripod- this one is a bit tippy even with weights. Purchased a different camera bag- personal preference."},{"reviewerName":"Momma D","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great choice for beginners!","reviewDate":"May 4, 2019","reviewText":"I am truly obsessed with this camera. I am happy that I chose the kit, as it allows so many options. I have captured the moon, I’ve captured beautiful macros, and I’m looking forward to getting some sport shots. The slave glad included does not seem to be compatible with this camera, I can’t seem to get it to work, so, I will have to spend a good pretty hefty amount of money to get a quality flash that is compatible and works well. I recommend for beginners."},{"reviewerName":"Ben","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great camera package for the price.","reviewDate":"October 5, 2019","reviewText":"This is an awesome package for the price. Only issue I have is the external flash that came with the package is not compatible with the camera. The camera has 4 contact pins, and the flash only has 1 that doesn't line up with anything. Other than that, this camera takes awesome pictures and I am extremely pleased with this purchase."},{"reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Amazing","reviewDate":"April 19, 2019","reviewText":"I use it for taking pictures at the rodeo and it works perfectly!"},{"reviewerName":"Rhonda N.","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great camera","reviewDate":"April 8, 2019","reviewText":"There are no negatives to report.
