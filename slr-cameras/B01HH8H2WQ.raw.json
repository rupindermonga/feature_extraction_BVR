Even with many of the default settings and manual zoom and focus, the pictures are outstanding. When I sent in pictures to be printed, I had to sign a copyright disclosure as the store wanted to make sure I wasn't ripping off professional photographers (I like to think it is because of my awesome skills, but I'm pretty sure it was because of the high quality of the images).\n\nAll the pieces in the package were included and none are of a low quality that are often found in packages like this. Do be aware that with all the lenses, camera, and pieces that this set is huge and heavy. I tried travelling with just one of the lenses to make it a little lighter and instantly regretted not having the versatility of the different lenses, so just be prepared to want to bring the whole pack with you!"},{"reviewerName":"Min Jane","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Buy it youâ€™ll love it","reviewDate":"June 12, 2019","reviewText":"Love this camera been real good to me I forgot I bought it on amazon too!

First, the mount wherein the lens attaches to the T6 camera body is rough and stiff unlike any of my other Canon lenses. I tried my other Canon lenses as well as the included 18-55 mm lens and all mounted smoothly to T6 body. Secondly, the lens does not focus in Auto mode. It meters but does not focus so no picture. It works great in Manual mode but for times when I want to use the lens in Auto mode, no dice.\n\nI will be contacting the seller directly to see if I can get a replacement for just the defective lens without having to return the entire package.\n\nAs for performance, the camera is lightweight, easier to use than my previous xTi, and just about fool proof if one has prior experience with DSLR cameras. I have not tried the movie mode yet and don't foresee a lot of use in that area but for folks into that sort of thing, I understand the sound is not the best so looking at the T6i may be a better option. The photos I've taken thus far have been of very good quality and the camera has performed well."},{"reviewerName":"tracy c","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Five Stars","reviewDate":"April 29, 2017","reviewText":"Excellent and amazing quality.

The handheld/tabletop tripod is so much better than I thought it would be, and the bag is great, as well. I'm still getting the hang of the extra lens and add on bits, but I'm having a blast with it so far. And, don't even get me started on how AMAZING the built-in wifi is! Seriously great bundle!"},{"reviewerName":"Vernon","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"... with all of its features will make taking photos easy and enjoyable","reviewDate":"January 7, 2017","reviewText":"The Canon Rebel T6 with all of its features will make taking photos easy and enjoyable!"},{"reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Five Stars","reviewDate":"March 27, 2017","reviewText":"SO Obsessed with this camera!"},{"reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","rating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Two Stars","reviewDate":"January 7, 2017","reviewText":"Product came defective."},{"reviewerName":"Patrick James Walters","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"I have not owned a camera since Viet Nam and ...","reviewDate":"November 14, 2016","reviewText":"I have not owned a camera since Viet Nam and that one was a Cannon as well.

This one is the best we have owned to date. It takes rapid up close shots in dimly lit Wisconsin youth hockey rinks. If you are used to a contained zoom lense, there is a learning curve to using detachable lenses, but once you get the hang of it, the camera is excellent. We have paid double for other cameras that did not have nearly the shutter speed on this camera and did not get anywhere near as close shots."},{"reviewerName":"JOSH","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Best Bundle Value!!!","reviewDate":"September 13, 2016","reviewText":"I researched for a DSLR camera for awhile and I've decided on the Canon EOS Rebel T6 bundle. I FOUND IT BY Photo4Less through Amazon...highly recommended! The package came in two days and it was packaged perfectly. I just started playing with it a little bit and find it fairly easy to use. Instruction manual online was easy to access and download. The bundle made it easy to get started with the camera without having to purchase individual items. Great price for the bundle!!!"},{"reviewerName":"You can't take criticsm","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great pic. Makes a lot of noise","reviewDate":"January 22, 2017","reviewText":"Takes great pictures. It is very very load for a camera. Take a picture and it makes a clatter. Turn on the view screen makes a load clatter. You wont be doing any wild life shooting with this camera. Order extra battery's. You will need them. Really hard on battery's"},{"reviewerName":"Somajan","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"I love it.","reviewDate":"September 22, 2016","reviewText":"I love it!

Th camera, the lenses, the flash cards!! The only gripe I have is the camera bag wasn't my style but I purchased a canon camera backpack to fit more items. The small tripod is pretty flimsy but I already have a larger tripod that I use. Overall it's definitely worth the price!!"},{"reviewerName":"Y King","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Five Stars","reviewDate":"November 24, 2016","reviewText":"great variety of accessories at good price"},{"reviewerName":"Robin","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"ONE OF A KIND!","reviewDate":"September 13, 2016","reviewText":"I love this bundle!\nIts unique!\nGREAT GIFT ITEM!\nComponents are high end quality!"},{"reviewerName":"Hilda A.","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"I Guessed","reviewDate":"September 20, 2016","reviewText":"This is OK"},{"reviewerName":"SED","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Canon EOS Rebel","reviewDate":"December 14, 2018","reviewText":"Awesome camera. It takes a while to get use to all the controls, but the pictures are fantastic. It's the best camera I have had so far. I am just a beginner, but we have so much wildlife I wanted to take some great pictures of them all. I feel confident that the pictures will turn out great. Just read the manual, and get to know your camera."}]}
