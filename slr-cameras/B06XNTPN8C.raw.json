I charged the battery while reading the manual (about 2 hours). When the battery light turned green, I put everything together and got started taking test shots. Almost immediately, I got an error saying to change the battery pack. I was sure the battery was fully charged, but I plugged it in for another 2 hours! *Both times, the display indicated a full battery.*\nI managed to play with the camera for about half an hour, while still getting the error message. Turning the camera off and on seemed to help, but any time I'd try to adjust a setting, it would give me an error. I had enough time with the camera to decide I wanted it! I just wanted it to work.\n\nI read other negative reviews that complained about this seller. So I didn't even bother dealing with them. I went right to Amazon and as always (in my experience) they were very helpful. I followed the process for exchanges / returns, and a customer service rep helped me trouble shoot the camera. He concluded that there was a fault with the mechanism, and proceeded to ask my preferences for refund and shipping methods.\n\nIt sucks that I have to wait longer for a new camera, but I'm just starting out, so what's a few more days?"},{"reviewerName":"Yumi K.","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Just like new","reviewDate":"February 28, 2018","reviewText":"This camera arrived in mint condition.

This item was a refurbished item and I have to say, when you hear refurb. you think of ok, its packed in a no label box, maybe with some bubble wrap, but this item can in MINT condition, I would not know it was a refurb. unless I say the tag, the item was like new, packed in its original box, with charger, battery, strap everything was well packed like it came out of Canon. We purchased this camera mainly for family events, and memories, we just had a new baby and are looking to move away from our smartphone camera usage :-), I know its convenience is great, uploaded photos, etc., but we wanted something more high quality, with better exposure, sharpest, etc., this is a great beginner camera, one of the things we did was took some online how to's, and let me tell you they help a ton. We went all out, got some backdrops, extra battery, since this was a refrub., we also got an extended warranty (wasnt very expensive), this is a great camera, the price from the seller was fantastic, cant be beat. Highly recommend. Also let me point out this does have wifi which you can transfer the high quality photos to your smartphone and uploaded it to the cloud, and NFC.

The automatic settings are great for quick on-the-fly picture taking, and the manual settings really open up the possibilities for getting that perfect shot. I am also impressed with the quality of video, though not as impressed with the built-in microphone.

Each time you choose something it has offers tips and explanations of how each adjustment will affect the photo.

I’ve been photography has been my hobby for the past couple years and wanted to do more with ISO, Focus, Aperture, Shutter speed and so on. My other camera did none of these things so I needed an upgrade, problem is I don’t have a ton of money and I was worried a camera this “cheap” was not going to be good. However this is possibly the best bang for your buck you can get! I have loved this camera and it has done me quite well. I would recommend however disabling the automatic flash, I think flash ruins things. I have had it for a few months and haven’t found a troubled with it so far. Battery lasts a long time and the quality picture you get all depends on you. Nice easy dial for changing settings fast during shoots.

The T6 is one of the smallest DSLR’s you can buy from Canon and pretty much any company for that matter. But to me, that’s not a bad thing. Being a very lightweight camera can sometimes mean you’re more inclined to pick it up and take it out with you, rather than being worried that’s it’s going to be too heavy. On the top of the camera right here we’ve got all of the buttons that’ you’d expect to see on a beginner dslr and also this mode dial which allows you to select the mode you want to be in. Of course you’ve got all of the basic beginner modes, like sports and portraits etc, but also aperture, shutter and manual modes for when you want to get a little bit more advanced. So overall the camera’s build is good for what it is, a lightweight dslr, but i’d always be a little bit careful with this type of body. It is however missing something that I really do like to see and that’s an articulating screen. The screen itself is actually pretty nice, but i’d like to see those improvements made in the next camera. If you’ve ever used a Canon camera before you’ll feel right at home with the menu system. It’s incredible easy to get around and change the settings you need. Wifi and NFC allows you to do is connect your camera to your phone and do a number of things like transfer your photos and also get a live view of what your shooting. To me this is the perfect camera to have this feature, because it’s targeting a younger generation of users who love to share their photos on instagram and Facebook. The Canon T6 isn’t super quick and can only shoot 3 shots per second. Now most of the time when you take a photo you’ll only be taking one shot anyway so it won’t make a big difference, but if you want to take some photos at a sports game or of a bird, this might not be the best camera for you. Autofocus in stills mode is actually surprisingly good, it’s snappy and should be fast enough for most situations. Now the lens that comes with the camera isn’t great, and is noisy in autofocus, but if you can get passed the noise, which sounds bit like a bee, it’ll work pretty well in well lit situations.\n\nSo let’s talk about price and more importantly value for money.\nNow the T6 comes in at $549, which is one of the cheapest DSLR’s you can buy on the market today. but still this at amazon you will get refurbished one with saving 200$ is not bad option. it comes with great packaging as you can see in other reviews.\n\nTo me it’s not a bad price, but there are definitely some very competitive options that I might look at, for example if you pay just a few hundred dollars more you can get a Canon t6 which is very good camera.\n\nSo overall the Canon t6 isn’t a bad little camera, and for beginners, it’ll be a lot of fun to learn on. If you’ve never owned a dslr this is a good camera to learn on, but if you want to go a little further with your dslr, I’d definitely be looking at a camera like the Canon t6i or t6s."},{"reviewerName":"Andrew Koch","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Easy to Use with Gorgeous Results!","reviewDate":"February 12, 2019","reviewText":"I am new to photography so I was hesitant to drop a large sum of money on something that I may or may not have understand how to use, but I am extremely pleased with this purchase. This camera is amazingly powerful but simplifies everything so that even a newbie photographer like myself could figure it out on day 1. The photos come out so crisp and clear, even on auto settings. Changing around the manual settings is very user friendly and the results are always spectacular. The camera itself is fairly lightweight (even with a lens attached) and is comfortable to hold without being awkward. The different settings make capturing different types of shots so easy! Action, nighttime, indoor, outdoors, this camera can do it all! Plus the built in wi-fi and NFC make sharing photos and transferring them to your phone or PC a snap! I highly recommend saving a bit and buying refurbished, I haven't had any issues with mine and you can put the money you save towards accessories or a new lens. This comes with everything you need to get started: the camera, a basic lens, lens caps, user manual, and camera strap. If you are just getting into photography, you won't regret purchasing this camera!"},{"reviewerName":"Valles","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Poor quality","reviewDate":"May 27, 2018","reviewText":"Not the best but I prefer it over Nikon.

I could not find the slightest bit of wear on it whatsoever. Understand that this doesn't mean that you will get the same product. Each one is different. But the one I got is spot on and looks like it has never been used. The second part of this is that it qualified for same-day delivery, which was a first for us. Understand that when you get same-day delivery they have until 9 pm to deliver it. Mine was delivered at 745pm. Now this was fine and it cost neothing extra for us to do it as we are prime members. Mostly a convience thing and was pretty neat that I ordered it at 8 in the morning and got it less than 12 hours later.\n\n2) The Camera itself. I read some other reviews about it coming just thrown in a box. Mine was neatly wrapped in bubble wrap...and I mean a lot of bubble wrap. All of the components were in working order. Again the Body and lense look like they have never been used. The strap was still in factory packaging as was the battery and charger. Having already shot a few hundred photos with it, I simply love it. I have been out of the photography world long enough that the last time I was active in it I developed my own photos in a dark room. With the advances to DSLR Tech I wanted to get back into the game, mostly for fun. After a lot of research, realised that buying the latest and greatest gee-whiz camera wasn't going to be the route I wanted to take. Needless to say while searching I found this. It was a good deal and came with everything needed to take photos out of the box. It really has a lot of features that are wonderful to bridge the gap between begginer and a little more advanced. By no means would I consider this a professional camera. If you want one of those you need to add another 0 to the end of the price on this.\n\nAll in all I am extremly happy with the purchase and would highly recommend this to anyone wanting to get their feet wet in the photography world."},{"reviewerName":"The Doctor","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Excellent","reviewDate":"September 21, 2017","reviewText":"This arrived on time however the box the camera was shopped was smashed on one side.

It came in a brand new-looking box and honestly looked like it had never been used. I’ve been using it what feels like non-stop for over a week now and the picture quality is great. I used to have a T3i and this one feels so much lighter. I also like that it does NOT have a pop-out screen. I never used it anyway and it just made the camera bulkier. All the lenses I used on my T3i work with this camera."},{"reviewerName":"Ariel","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Good first real camera for beginners","reviewDate":"September 6, 2019","reviewText":"Looks brand new and has everything that should be there. Although I thought it would include an SD, which it did not, but that's cheap and easy to buy so that's not a problem for me. This is my first \"real\" camera and I'll say it's definitely worth the price! The quality so far is great! I can't wait to play with it more and explore it's features. I plan on using the camera for YouTube and I think it'll be good. I'm going to go over the manual so I can get more familiar and I can't wait!

The only thing I wish is available for this is the ability to turn off shutter but I know most DSLRs doesn't have that because of mirror."},{"reviewerName":"Lincoln B","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Mainly that the memory is needed to use the camera; 8 to 32 GB will get you going.

As I was unpacking, I couldn’t even tell that this camera had been previously owned/refurbished. Every part of everything in the box was in mint condition.\nThe ease of use of this camera is what drew me to purchase it. This is perfect for a vacation or an event. It’s super easy to pull it out and flick the on switch and it’s ready to go. My favorite feature is the WiFi and NFC capabilities. I can easily transfer a photo that I’ve taken on this camera to my cell phone. I am way surprised with the ease of use of this camera. I bought it becaus I favor Canon.

Here was my dilemma... I wanted to get a good camera that would take better pictures than my iPhone XR. I’m new to photography so I wanted a camera that I could play with new settings to continue to progress In the quality of pictures that I take. For $330 I think this camera is a steal! I’ve enjoyed every second of this camera. Tons of things I still need to learn, but being a budget DLSR camera I’d say this is a wonderful beginner camera! Not to mention the WiFi connectivity is the coolest thing!! It allows you to view and download all your pictures straight to your phone which can be really convenient bypassing the use of the SD card + computer. Also you can use your smartphone as a remote to see the view of the camera and take pictures.

But a word of advice; buy it from Amazon and not directly from Canon if you want good customer service. I just learned this harsh lesson the hard way. A few dollars more on Amazon is well worth it.\n\nEnough with the ran... Now the review:\n\nThis is a great camera for what I do and I believe it will be just fine for most people. This camera replaced my Canon AE-1P which was one of the best 35mm cameras of it's day and believe it or not is still being use. If you still have a Canon AE-1P I encourage you to find a user's group. For fast action shots like insects and arachnids it is still hard to beat 35mm film and the Canon AE-1P. The only reason I am going digital at all is, it is very hard to find someone to develop 35MM film. And when you do, they normally scan it with a crappy scanner so your prints look terrible. I do not know of anyone who still develops 35mm film and uses real photo paper.\n\nFirst off read the manual it will make life a lot simpler. Then go to the website and download the Canon software. You will not regret these simple steps. If you have not bought your camera yet, make sure you buy a simple UV filter and lens cap keeper with your order. The UV filter is to protect the lens. It is better to damage a $5.99 UV filter than the lens itself. If you drop your lens cap in the woods or on a street in down town tourist city USA you are never going to see it again in most cases.\n\nI went through all the modes on the camera and I could not find a single one I did not like. The best feature is MANUAL Mode and Program with manual settings. The autofocus is nice and all and the automatic presets are nice but they pale in comparison to setting the camera manually. You get much better pictures when using manual settings no matter what camera you use. In most cases it is hard to see the differencein the picture quality. This is only really important if you have to shoot a subject that is tiny and very close. Autofocus has a limited close range and the fact that you can focus manually is very important. In low light the presets will take a decent picture. However through manual settings you can pull out more detail.\n\nThe Continuous shooting mode has a respectable rate. It is not as good as the Nikon D3400 however as this camera cost around $100.00 less, that is ok. I have shot a few flies in flight and it was just fine. If I needed something more I would simply dial in movie mode. and take a video.\n\nSetting the ISO vs Auto: In bright sunlight there is not a noticeable difference. However at night there is a huge difference. This is something you either have to practice a lot or take a class to get right. The good news is that with the T6 you can change the ISO. For me that is important because most spiders come out at night.\n\nDid I mention that I am a armature wildlife photographer specializing in spiders? Well yes, that is what I do in my spare time. This camera is great for low light or total darkness.\n\nThis camera is super lightweight. This is important if you have to carry it for long distances. Yes there are \"better, heavier\" cameras out there but when you are miles out in a national park having a lightweight camera will serve you a lot better. And if Joe Bear or Molly Wolverine decides to make a meal of you, lightweight is a life saver. This camera is not expensive. So if a bear eats it you are not out of a lot of money.\n\nPros Cons\nLight weight Cannot take the beating of an AE-1P\nHas a view Finder When in movie mode switches the view finder off and uses LCD\nCan switch to the LCD screen Only 18 Megapixel and you need around 20-24 to match 35MM film\nHas lots of manual settings Not weather proof - Please remember this\nWarranty even covers refurbs No external Microphone jack\nIt is a Canon and operates like a Canon Shutter release feels a bit awkward at first\nHas a great built in flash\nCan take a hotshoe flash\nHas optional remote control\nCan be remote controlled from a cell phone or computer\nHas WiFi\nEasy to use\nDecent Autofocus but also allows manual focus.\nInterchangeable lens\nCan record sounds\nCan use the flash as an autofocus assist in total darkness.\n\nIn closing the only real limits to the T6 is the lens you put on it. Better lens means better pictures. A cheap lens will drag down a good camera. The stock lens that comes with it is a cheap lens. I will order a better lens in a few weeks. However the lens that comes with the camera is good enough. I would not want to take a very expensive camera into a swamp to take pictures of spiders to post online. 18 megapixels is more than enough for web content. In fact the amount of megapixel is really only important if you have to enlarge the picture. It means I can be a bit further away and then enlarge the picture to get a nice image. A telephoto lens will solve that problem.\n\nThis camera will not break the bank so if it gets destroyed because you misjudged how fast an alligator can run (I did that once) and have to feed it your camera as you run away screaming and waving your arms, you can easily buy another one. I cannot speak for portrait photographers as I am not one, but I plan to take some classes and see how this camera performs.\n\nFrom casual shooting to wildlife photography you cannot go wrong with a T6. It is fast enough to capture moving objects but I doubt it will stop a bullet in flight. It cannot make your spelling, grammar or typing better either so don't judge me. But it will get the job done and if you are lucky enough to land a gig with a magazine it should be good enough.\n\nI included some pictures of spiders I took this morning. I just got the Camera 3 days ago and I have taken 249 pictures and 3 videos. The battery is still charged fully.\n\nCheers"},{"reviewerName":"Srm2256","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great basic camera","reviewDate":"March 8, 2018","reviewText":"I am not a professional photographer- I take pictures of my kid and of my friends and family as a hobby. I had been using a Nikon D3400 usually with a 50mm (f/1.8?) lens. I always had it on manual focus and I had learned the camera and was getting pretty good at it. My sister decided she wanted the Nikon so after research I decided to buy this one, with the reviews of the faster and better autofocus than the Nikon being the main selling point. I thought maybe this would help trying to get those clear pictures of my toddler.\nI’ve had this for a few weeks and again purchased a 50mm f/1.8 lens for more “portrait” type photography. So maybe I need more time to adjust but I am not a fan of the autofocus. It never seems to select the right point. You can manually select which area you want to be in focus but that kind of defeats the purpose for me. Maybe once I learn to do that faster..\nSo I tried manual focus and absolutely hate it on this camera. I think I just need more practice with the autofocus.\nI should mention that I never use it in auto mode. Usually when trying to get those close up, clear pictures I shoot in Av mode so I can set my aperture as low as I want.\nI do love the WiFi feature that the Nikon didn’t have. It greatly speeds up the process of transferring pictures.\nI also seem to like the kit lens better on this camera.\nMaybe in a few months I will come back and update how I’m doing with this new camera, but this is my first impression just as someone who has been using a basic DSLR like this without any formal education.\nOverall, I do think it’s a good camera especially for the price and I would probably buy again.\n\nThe picture of the dog was with the Canon and the cake was with the Nikon.\n\nUpdate: I love it more than my Nikon now. I learned some new things about it and also took it off some portrait setting it came on that is supposed to soften skin, which was making my pictures look strange in my opinion. I also set it to back button focus- SO much easier. I have been shooting in manual mode with great success. So glad I went with reviews and got a Canon this time. Great value.

The Cannon rebel T6i is better for videos because that has a flip screen and this one doesn’t."},{"reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great camera!","reviewDate":"January 28, 2018","reviewText":"Looks brand new.
