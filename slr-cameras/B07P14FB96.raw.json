For a beginner like me, the Canon Rebel T7 is a perfect starter camera as it gives the ability to use manual mode where you can control things like the ISO, Aperature, and shutter speed, but also several auto modes for those who just don't want handle those options. The lenses were all great; however, the 500mm felt like overkill unless you're into certain types of photography. I've been able to get some great shots with all lense. The carrying bag is also a great starter for lens storage. Really happy and excited to venture deeper into photography with this bundle."},{"reviewerName":"Kickstand","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Nice Quality","reviewDate":"May 13, 2019","reviewText":"Gave as a gift and she seems to like it a lot. Has taken pictures outside and really like the quality and ability make \"blurr\" photo's. Inside might need to look at some of the setting to get better quality. Looked at the retail store and got a lot better deal ordering online with the package bundle. Overall seems like a nice camera with no regrets purchasing it.\nHas been using a lot more. It has quit a few features and still figuring out some of them.

It is taking us some time to learn how to use everything that comes with it. That is just because we have never had a camera like this and are not all that tech savvy.

I bought this kit and it really came with everything except a tripod, which I bought after the fact. The camera is very easy to use, and with the multiple shooting methods, both manual and preprogrammed modes, you can point and shoot or take some truly excellent photos. Having used this for over a month now, there are no real downsides. If you are in the market, I would consider this camera package."},{"reviewerName":"Julie T.","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great Bundle and Camera!","reviewDate":"September 25, 2019","reviewText":"Very pleased with this bundle and Camera!
