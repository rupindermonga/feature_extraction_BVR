I should have known better. It DOES come with the 1 Canon kit lens. The other 2 lenses are XIT brand and the two of them together can be purchased for less than $20. They actually make the pictures worse. Also, just to note, these are not stand alone lenses. They screw onto the front of the lens like a filter would. These are completely not usable for any kind of quality pictures. An average point and shoot camera takes higher quality pictures than you will get through these lenses.\n\nIf this is your first DSLR, the kit provides a decent value. All of the components are cheap, but will give you an idea if those are things you will use and should replace with better versions.\n\nThe camera itself is (so far) awesome.

I have been using it for about a month now, and it has been wonderful. It is a fantastic first time camera and does a great job at helping you learn it. The rating is due to what comes with the camera, so please beware.\n\nPros: The SD cards alone provide good value, as they can get expensive as you need bigger cards, for a first-timer, and as long as you aren't shooting raw+jpeg like I am, you won't need anything else. Also helps to mention you get a sd card wallet and a usb reader/writer. The uv and other filters are also nice if you want to use filters in your shots, when I first started out I was using a uv filter on my kit lens. I have since bought a much better lens, and do not use a filter anymore. The cleaning kit is very handy, I have no problems there but also bought a professional cleaning kit. The mini tripod is quite cute and has been handy a few times, beware, I have had trouble getting it to hold up my camera sturdy enough with anything other than the kit lens. As stated above, the camera and everything it comes with is good. It also comes with a remote shutter which is very nice as well. I tried it out with my silly little tripod and was pleased with the result.\n\nCons: My biggest issue with my purchase is it sounded like you are getting two extra lenses with the purchase. You're not. The picture you see of the three lenses grouped together: the bigger one is the kit lens and the two extras next to it are them. They are not lenses, they do not attach to the camera. I would call these \"lens extensions\", as they screw onto your kit lens like a uv filter does. They are also 100% worthless, please take it from someone who has already tried them, and then bought other lenses and compared the difference. I would upload the bad pictures they took, but have since deleted them out of my library. The bag it comes with is incredibly small, and barely fits all of your accessories, heaven forbid you go and get more equipment to add to it. I have since purchased a backpack that I can grow into, and the bag is now a spare parts bag. The bigger tripod is a cheap plastic, and while it is just fine for indoor photography and videos, I wouldn't dare use it on a windy day taking landscape shots. The flash could be a pro or con depending on your personal thoughts. It is not an ETTL, meaning that you have to manually adjust your settings to match the flash and how it fires, the camera will not do it for you. It also is completely stationary, it is brighter than the built-in flash, which is better for outdoor shots that you need to light up. I can imagine it would be difficult for a beginner, it was difficult for me.\n\nConclusion: If I had known better at the time, I would have either spent less money to get a kit without \"lenses\" or spent a little bit more to get real lenses included in the kit. The camera itself and the SD cards provide wonderful value, but I would not make this purchase again and wouldn't recommend it to anyone."},{"reviewerName":"Joe","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Super easy to use and very high quality pictures","reviewDate":"February 23, 2017","reviewText":"Will keep this review short and simple.

It's fully automatic but you can gradually take creative control of every aspect of your photography as you become more comfortable with the settings and features. The tiny instruction manual included in the package gives just the basics and can be frustrating, but download the PDF file and there are your clear directions, step by step and in color. For an experienced amateur photographer some of the items included in the kit will be redundant (who doesn't have at least two tripods?) but buying the camera, lenses, flash and cards separately would be more expensive than what you receive in this packed bundle. The only thing I would change is one feature of its WiFi capabilities. Unlike the Canon SX60HS, it can't wirelessly download to the hard drive of a computer. You would use your cable or card reader. But it's just a minor annoyance. It can easily send your photos to any mobile device."},{"reviewerName":"Maria Vega","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Best camera for your money!","reviewDate":"June 22, 2017","reviewText":"Absolutely love my camera 110%....

My favorite is the large tripod. The screen protectors do not look good on the screen so I didn't use them (see pic) The flash is by Vivitar so is the camera bag and table top tripod (which was not able to hold the camera) The extra lenses and lens filters provided are by a different company so you need to purchase an adapter to connect them if you want to use them with the camera. I took a few pictures of sunflowers on here to show you the amazing detail. Customer service is wonderful and super to deal with. The cleaning kit came with a soaked box and empty bottle but said they'd send me another one. So far so good, I think it's great!

Nice picture quality and easy for a novice to use.","reviewDate":"July 25, 2017","reviewText":"This is the 3rd Canon Rebel I have owned. I had one before the era of digital cameras and then I purchased my first digital version 12 years ago. My 12 year old very outdated Canon Rebel was still taking good pictures but the lag time and some other issues had me looking to finally upgrade to a newer version. After reading reviews, I decided to go with the T6 and the package deal offered here on Amazon.\n\nThis camera is everything I expected it to be. An upgraded and better version of my older one. All of my Canon lens and my Canon Flash attachment can be interchanged. I still haven't had a chance to figure out how the Wi-Fi features works but will get to that feature shortly.\n\nI am strictly a novice photographer. I really have no idea how to use any of the manual settings. This camera helps a novice feel more like a\npro. The quality of the pictures is impressive. I highly recommend this camera for anyone that enjoys photography but may feel a bit intimidated by some of the more complex and expensive SLR cameras. This camera is easy enough for anyone to figure out.\n\nI also recommend this package. Although I won't use everything that was included, the memory cards, the UV filters ,and the two screw on lens attachments make it worth purchasing the bundle. As for the UV filter it's good to use just to protect your camera. Sometimes I remove it\nbefore taking a picture and then screw it back on when I am finished. It's a great extra layer of protection."},{"reviewerName":"Caitlin","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Amazing Value!","reviewDate":"June 18, 2017","reviewText":"I am SO excited about this purchase!

Works perfectly. I took one star because the external flash of the bundle only works as slave and does not work directly with the camera. (This means that it is still usable, the flash reads the light from the camera flash and works, you just cant use it directly attached to the camera as the main flash) If this is a bundle everything should work properly). Is important to note that not all the things from the bundle are of very good quality but many are really useful. In our case, the most useful items of the bundle are: Tripod, sd cards, bag, cleaning cloth, external shooting cable. I'll upload some photos shoot with the camera with the default kit lens it came with, important to note that I shoot in RAW and use Lightroom, nothing mayor, just a bit of contrast, just a little bit of saturation and sharpness.

The bad news is that this Canon IS (crazy). Simply put, this camera (Rebel T6) provides wifi connection to everything BUT a computer! The options you are given are to transfer to another camera, a mobile device, a printer, or Canon's cloud-based service. Do other Canon cameras allow you to connect to computers via wifi? Yes, but not this one. To me, this IS crazy because without this (basic) feature, you either have to swap out SD cards or connect the camera via USB. Clearly, the technology IS there, they have just disabled it in order to force people to use their cloud service. Not cool, Canon.\n\n**My original Post\nYou definitely get your money's worth with this package and a friend of mine was delighted to hear that I bought this set, because she was expecting to pay twice as much for less items. I will say that, for some reason, the camera I got has a difficult time focusing on the subject if it is not brightly lit (on auto-focus and with most of the pre-set picture modes). I initially thought that the 2x zoom was the culprit, but after removing that, I still tend to have issues. Granted, the camera is still a bit new to me, but I used to have a 35mm Canon Rebel and I never had the issue I'm having now.

The card reader ruined a couple of cards, so buy a better one. The 55mm lens is great. The other ones aren't very exciting. The camera bag was alright, but don't expect to fit everything in it. The tripod is a cheap-o, but does the trick for beginners. The polarized filter is excellent. I leave it on the camera as a lens protector. The card case is handy for all the SD cards.\n\nI'd recommend this camera in a heartbeat, but most of the non-canon accessories are garbage. It's a great beginner/intermediate camera. The auto and pre-set options aren't worth using, and you'll be disappointed with the pictures those take. I highly recommend taking the time to learn the aperture, shutter, ISO, etc. It's easy to get off of the auto-mode and use AV, TV, P modes.

So far as far as I can tell, there is no such trickery. All of the items are packed in one big box as one item. Mine came in an additional outer amazon box. If that is surely the case there is absolutely no reason to buy this camera anywhere else, especially if you have Prime. I personally ordered it on Tuesday and it arrived on Thursday even though it was only guaranteed by Friday.\n\nAs you might suspect everything except the camera kit itself (body, 1 lens, neckstrap, etc.) are not Canon brand. As shown in the picture the memory cards are transcend, and the rest is a blend between a few brands, mostly Vivitar and Xit Photo (the brand for the additional two lenses). I am not as qualified as I would like to be to comment on the quality of the two additional lenses, and so will update this review once I have a true photographer friend check them out.\n\nAs for the camera itself, the big disappointment thus far has been the \"Wi-fi\" capability. We were upgrading from a Rebel T1, and the majority of the functions for this camera are the same and work great. If you bought this you were looking for an entry-level DSLR, and that is exactly what you get. The Wi-Fi function however is fairly horrendous. Yes, TECHNICALLY you can upload photos directly from the camera to a certain set of web services (including google drive which is my choice), but not without first installing software on your PC and/or phone and going through a complicated set up process. Once you have all that set up you quickly find there is no way to simply \"upload all\" photos from your camera, but you have to select and send them one by one. The only possible exception to this is the Canon service itself which I have no intention of using. I have not tried photos set up for HDR yet, but I am relatively sure it will have a hard time for that as it wasn't even advertised.\n\nEverything else about this camera is great, and the wife loved unpacking all the accessories. So far every item I have tested has worked great (the two memory cards, the memory card reader, the lens cap saver thingy, tripod. So many little things in here she didn't know she needed.

It's pretty easy to use. It comes with a lot of stuff that I probably won't ever need, but they are nice to have anyway. I think it is a good value. The only thing that bothers me is that it depends so much on the battery being charged. There is no power cord to plug into a wall socket so that you can shoot table-top objects without the battery. You have to rely on the battery all the time. It can get tedious remembering \"Oh yeah, I need to charge the battery — AGAIN\". Down time. I was able to download photos into my Macintosh (which is 8 years old) without the battery being charged. That being said, you can't charge the battery while it's in the camera from the computer.

I do senior pictures for fellow students and family portraits. The quality is amazing it’s easy enough to use point click and the flash works fantastic. The extra light I’ve set up as an exterior light for some photo projects and it’s worked fantastically. The tripod works in any ground pretty much with the help of a small level on the top of it. If I’m on a hill and I wanna know if it’s straight it works perfectly. The lenses are great! Perfect condition when the arrived, they are exactly what I wanted and what a steal! The UV lens is perfect for super gloomy days I think. It makes them look a little brighter in my opinion less bleh. Which is always nice. The bag it comes with is sturdy no tears no holes! The dividers are movable. You can take them out and switch them around! Which is nice since I’m always switching out the stuff I need for work! It has a million pockets to fit everything you need! The lenses have small pouches and covers to put on and in when you’re not using them. Handy indeed! The two SD cards work great! It has a little wallet like case for them that can attach to the cameras strap for easy convenient use! It does not has an extra battery for the camera however! It charges super fast in an hour and a half (1hr 30 mins) usually it’ll be fully charged! It’s also WiFi enabled! Meaning if you ya ether cannon app you can use your camera remotely through the app! You can also download pictures from it and tag locations you’ve shot at! Super handy!!!! The small clicker you can hook up on the side of camera is great! It works great! It’s very short however. Use only when working with nervous kids so they don’t see you take the picture! The pocket tripod isn’t that useful for me personally but maybe a smaller vlogger or general YouTuber could find it useful it’s only about 5 inches high but it’s super sturdy! The camera might look to big but it holds up great! I use the strap it’s semi comfortable it needs broken in but I don’t recommend it. It’s rough around the edges of it but still usable. I’m ordering a better strap because I use it often and my neck will hurt after shooting for 4-5 hours.\nOverall great package! Super useful and great for amateurs or people starting out with Cannon!"},{"reviewerName":"Anna","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"A good deal, great camera for amateurs","reviewDate":"July 30, 2018","reviewText":"I had been using a 10 year old hand-me-down Canon Rebel until it died. I knew I wanted another Rebel, so I chose this bundle as the best deal acknowledging that some of the accessories are off-brand and possibly useless. I had checked a couple stores, and I would have paid the same amount, if not more, for just the camera and the lens. The one down side is that it doesn't offer an extended warranty, so I'll just have to keep my fingers crossed. The camera is great, the lens is ok. I have a better lens from my old camera, so I didn't use the stock lens much. As for the accessories- the memory card, external flash, usb reader, and remote all function with the camera. Everything fits in the bag that comes with it, except for the tripod. I think this is a good bundle for the money.\n\nI think the Canon Rebels are a great option for people who aren't trying to make money off their photography. I've never used another type of camera, so I can't fully compare but I've been able to take photos I'm really proud of with both of my rebels, and a free online photog course."},{"reviewerName":"Joe Di Piero","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Love this camera.","reviewDate":"November 26, 2016","reviewText":"Love this camera.

It's almost impossible to get a great shot of the moon even under the best lighting conditions. Other than that the other gimmes were okay, but really aren't necessary. You'll find out once you start to actually use the kit. IMO look into getting a colored lens kit for around 10-20 bucks. This will help with some of your nature shots and cut down on using Photoshop or other like programs for editing. Also, make sure to register this.

Most of the kit items are of low quality, but the it's a great setup for a beginner on a budget. The wide angle lens I received however does not fit the anything that came with the kit (including it's own cap). I'm pretty sure some of this was used, but I mostly got it for the camera and lens. I'm frustrated the lens isn't usable right now, but all in all, if you have no supplies, I guess it's a start. I may have gone with another kit though if I knew the lens wasn't going to work. To clarify, the telephoto lens works fine, the macro wide angle lens does not.

Appropriate for a beginner and takes great pictures. A lot of the equipment included in this kit is quite useful, and some I haven't touched yet. I did try out the telephoto lens extender and found it difficult to thread properly. It pulled apart when I removed it from the kit lens and I wasn't quite sure what lens parts belonged with the kit lens and which ones belonged with the extender. But I eventually figured it out. So, I'd just say be careful with the extenders. Thread them slowly and delicately or they come apart. The tripod has a removable clip that you can leave on your camera to easily clip back onto the tripod. Very convenient.

My TA helped me pick out this model/set to start with as I needed a DSLR for my photo class and I was lost as to what to get. I’ve been using this camera and the various inclusions for the past couple of weeks, and it has really aided in improving my photos. There are quite a few things I haven’t used yet (like the filters) but the SD cards, reader, tripods, and bag have all been helpful. In fact, I found the included “Photo4Less” bag to be a little too big for my daily use. It will definitely hold a lot of extra accessories inside of it alongside the camera and kit lens. However, for my purposes, I went ahead and purchased another smaller bag for walking around town/campus with. The included bag would probably be good for traveling though.\n\nI found the seller of this bundle, Photo4Less, to be good.

In hindsight, I would have just bought the camera body and got the 50mm and 10-18mm lenses separately instead of getting the whole kit. The 18-55mm lense is for beginners. I used it for a short while until I got two new lenses (50mm and 10-18mm). The lense attachments for the include 18-55mm lense simulate what true wide-angle and telephoto lenses can do. The flash is OKAY. I'd recommend an external flash from Pro Master with an IR remote. It's nice that the kit include two memory cards. I shoot in RAW so the more space, the better. The tripod is decent, but the screw plate isn't a very stable platform for the camera. It also does not feature a quick-attach, so you will have to meticulously screw on the camera every time you want to use the tripod. The bag is okay but a little bulky. I got the Think Tank Turnstyle 10 after a few months of using the Vivitar bag. Overall, this is a good buy for beginners, but in the long run, I'd recommend investing in better gear over time, if you're going to be a serious photographer."},{"reviewerName":"Byron Whitlock","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great camera, WIFI only lets you view on your smartphone","reviewDate":"October 28, 2018","reviewText":"Great camera, but the wifi feature is really misleading.

While I've only had a couple of cheaper cameras that I could call my own, I have used a variety of cameras, but this is my first DSLR....and I LOVE IT! The Canon lens that comes with it is a handy for multiple situations and shooting conditions, as well as the ability to zoom a bit. However, my praises on this bundle, for the most part, start and end with the camera and the Canon lens. Most of the bundle is kind of a joke except for a few choice items, that I should say does still make it worth the additional $20 or so more it is than getting just the camera and lens without the accessories. The bag, SD cards, and SD card reader are all helpful, and are by themselves worth the extra $20 for the included accessory bundle. However, the stand alone flash is not compatible with this camera. The two \"lenses\" that are included are not really lenses at all, but actually screw on the end of your nice Canon lenses, making your pictures worse. The cheap filters are exactly that, a handful of cheap filters, that I suppose could come in handy, maybe, one day...possibly. I have not tried out the remote switch yet or the lens cleaning kit. And lastly, the tripod is a cheap plastic one that will likely get broken in a matter of a few shows during transport, and will likely need to be replaced. Attached some photos from the camera.\nTl;dr - This bundle is great, and this camera is amazing for someone who wants solid quality for a good price.

Some of the accessories aren't even compatible with the camera!! And some articles I've read say their \"filter lenses\" might even damage your device.\n\nThat said you do get two memory cards, a tripod, a strap, and a table tripod that are useful...

At the moment, I am using it in Auto mode, so it feels very familiar since I have used Canon cameras for many years. I chose this bundle because I thought it would be a good start with the extra accessories included. However, I am disappointed that the wide angle and telephoto lenses are not Canon products.

The camera itself is so-so but the added lenses are not good and the rest of the stuff is somewhat junky and has a toxic chemical smell. I found most of the kit to be extraneous, and when the camera did not function the way I had hoped, I sold it for a low price and they wouldn't even take anything but the camera body.\n\nIn bright light if you are close to your subject, the camera takes very nice detailed photos - I was very happy with those and will miss having the ability to take them now that I don't have the camera anymore. Indoors in low light settings was generally a challenge and the automatic settings blurred most of the indoor photos I tried to take. Perhaps someone with more experience could have gotten better photos in low light, I'm not sure.\n\nMy main issue was the the camera would barely zoom and the lenses in the kit barely did any better."},{"reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Five Stars","reviewDate":"January 26, 2018","reviewText":"Great starter camera!

Using cell phones to take picture's really had me thinking I was a bit of a natural and worse, a professional photographer. However, I've had expensive camera's before by Kodak and Nikon and they were easy to use when I brought them. I LOVE taking photo's and scrap booking family so, I thought I should buy a good camera to make my photo's look better. I also brought the T6 because of the name \"rebel.\" Silly idea. I opened the camera and I thought I could just cut it on and you have to charge a battery and then add a battery AND the like memory card. And its not like you can just take a picture and then edit the exposure, brightness and so on. You have to like master the settings and read the manual before you can do anything. My brother had a friend come over with his T6I and he helped me with the settings so I could take basic photo's. He told me to keep my setting in 'program' and he set me up in the 'raw' format. The reviews said the lens and flash are not compatible with the T6 so, I have a lot of things I can't use until I take a class or buy a book for Dummies. I mostly take photo's of people but, I brought the bundle to use the lens to take picture's of nature, the sun, tree's and flowers or sky scrapers so the lens are a disappointment. The camera itself is so amazing, I look forward to spending money on quality lens. The camera itself is 5 stars. I am a beginner and I see the different in quality. As a beginner, right now, I use app's to edit my photo's, not the camera. But, I love the way people seem to 'pop' out in photo's and how natural light looks with this camera.\nThe order came really faster and I expected it much later. The package was set up perfectly and maybe its not the camera and its me. Cells phones have me all messed up but, I learned how to edit pictures with cell phone app's so maybe it will help me later"},{"reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"This camera is amazing a big step up from my fuji camera","reviewDate":"January 5, 2017","reviewText":"This camera is amazing a big step up from my fuji camera.

So far, I've only played around with the most basic features and adjusting the focus on the standard lens. I'm very impressed with the image quality and the speed at which the pictures are taken. I've mostly used my kids as my subjects and they move fast. The clarity of photos is excellent.\nThe case is great--lots of room for the camera and many if the accessories.\n\nI can't wait to try out the rest of the equipment!"},{"reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Four Stars","reviewDate":"January 18, 2017","reviewText":"My daughter is still learning how to use"},{"reviewerName":"Josué Tuz","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Five Stars","reviewDate":"June 28, 2016","reviewText":"Cool set.

Yea right!\nCharged it up, registered it while waiting and boom. Turned it on, set time zone, date, time, etc . Picked simple mode just to shoot, and see resolution. Picked display, saw what I shot and after, wanted to shoot more and no display anymore? Tried another mode, nothing, hit menu, NOTHING. Had to take battery out and place back in to register again. So mad that even after resetting it and trying again with no result. Called Amazon, and told guy that im familiar with t6 and have another Canon camera. He told me to use the lens on other camera to see what problem is. I told him, the camera wasn't on site ( had it delivered to my home)..... wtf?

The camera and the filters are amazing, and they pick up so much color and detail in the photos. The built in wifi capability from the camera is a lifesaver, allowing you to load photos and videos from your camera onto your phone in one step, even if you don't have cell phone service. The circular polarizer included in the kit works like a dream! The 2 sd cards that come in the bundle are so convince to have, especially on a long trip, because I used almost all the space on both of them. The camera itself can shoot in raw mode as well as jpeg, and it can shoot videos. The camera also hasn't an AEB capability that can be set up to 3 stops for taking hdr photos. The camera battery life seems pretty long while taking photos, but while taking videos it drains pretty fast, which is understandable. The camera bag feels sturdy and durable and can fit all the accessories included in this bundle (except for the tripod) inside the bag with the correct packing. The tripod itself feels a little flimsy compared to other tripods I've used but from my experiences it can support the camera just fine. All in all, if you are looking to buy your first camera, or to upgrade from a previous model, I would reccomend going with this camera bundle. Everything you need to start shootings great photos is included! I have attatched some of my favorite photos I have taken with my canon rebel t6!"},{"reviewerName":"T.

Everything is included which makes it a great price for what you get. However I do have a few concerns. First off my battery will not charge at all. I believe I received either a faulty charger or a faulty battery. It flashes yellow but even after charging it for 2 days straight it still says it's dead when I turn on my camera. Secondly the smaller tripod is not very sturdy and doesn't seem to hold up the weight of this camera. The extra lenses (lens adaptors? Not sure what to call them sense they aren't actually lenses on their own) are not very good quality. Overall a good camera and reasonably priced bundle but I'd like a new charger/battery replacement.\n\nUpdAte: I bought a new battery and still have the same issue!!!"},{"reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Five Stars","reviewDate":"August 29, 2016","reviewText":"great del I love the camera!!!!"},{"reviewerName":"Natasha","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great for Beginners or Hobby Photographers","reviewDate":"December 15, 2018","reviewText":"The Canon t6 is a very nice, durable camera. The small body is rather light, and feels nice to hold, even with my large hands. The ISO goes up to 6400, which is a bit limiting with the kit lens, but I find that it forces me to be creative. I love the WI-FI connectivity, with it I can easily move my photos to my phone via the Canon app. I do feel that this way does take a long time, however. (If I move 150 RAW photos, it would take about 10 minutes.) I have certainly got my moneys worth out of this camera. The price point may seem a bit high to those who have not splurged on a DSLR before, but I can assure you that you will not be disappointed with the Canon t6. I have used this camera almost everyday, and it has survived light rain, bumping against walls, and even my friend accidentally dropping it.\n\nThe 18-55mm kit lens allows for the user to have a taste of a little bit of everything. At 18mm, the user can take some fantastic wide angle photos, such as landscapes. At 55mm, the user is able to take portraits. This lens is also capable to take photos at 22mm, which resembles the human eye. Now, this lens does produce crisp photos, but I would not recommend it for low light. Not with this camera at least. With an f stop at 4, and max ISO of 6400, you will produce rather noisey or underexposed photos. Luckily, these problems can usually be fixed post-process. The photo I have attached was taken at night, at f4.5 and ISO 3200. I used the street lamp to light her face, and she is standing in front of a Christmas tree. I have touched up the color and luminance noise, so that the noise is not quite as bad. So, as you can see, you are able to get decent low light photos.\n\nAs for the kit, I was not so pleased. First of all, the large tripod is decent. It has a good weight to it, but I do feel that the wind could knock it over. The small tripod is cute, and is actually very sturdy despite the size. I hardly ever get use of it, but it does make as a good grip. Second, the camera bag is very nice, and is quite roomy. I was able to fit the entire kit into the bag with no problem. If you plan on getting more lenses or adding to your kit, I would recommend just getting a backpack. I find that after long use, my shoulder would be sore from the strap digging in. Next, the wide angle and telephoto lens. These lenses are actually screwed to the front of the 18-55mm lens, and are not able to mount onto the body. I personally did not use these at all, and I feel that the kit could have been done without them. Now, the filters. I like these a lot. They do their job, and quite nicely as well. They are easy to clean with the provided microfiber. The remote for the camera comes in handy for those action and long exposure shots that people love. This remote is connected via a wire, which has a limiting length, but at least it works. As for the card reader, it works. The 16GB and 32GB cards do work, but it would be better to get cards with more storage. Or, at least get extra cards to conveniently have. Finally, the flash. The flash takes 2 AA batteries, which I never got around to buying. You might as well use the flash on the t6 itself, as I do not think this particular flash is worth carrying around.\n\nOverall, I feel like the kit is very cheap. The only thing worthy of keeping is the camera (and strap), the bag, the cards (and wallet), the filters, the remote, and the cloth. The tripod can be useful, but I would rather just get one that weighs a bit more and feels more sturdy. Honestly, this kit is technically free with the camera, so I can't complain too much. On Canon's website itself, you would spend at least $500 on the camera and lens alone. Here, you can get that, and more, for $100 less. This is a great buy."},{"reviewerName":"Kati","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Do not buy if you want to take outside","reviewDate":"January 9, 2019","reviewText":"I have had two Canon Rebels in the past few years. The first was a gift from my boyfriend who had it for several years with no issues. I took it snowshoeing a few days later and it worked great. It was not actively snowing or raining and camera worked fine the entire day. The next morning I attempted to turn my camera on and I got a generic error message. I tried everything (changing lens, battery, memory card, etc.) and took it to several experts, none of whom knew what was wrong and told me that the cost of fixing it would be more than buying a new one. So I bought a new Canon Rebel T6 and it worked great for maybe 9 months. I took it hiking many many times in all sorts of weather and precipitation levels (I live in Oregon so it rains a lot). Camera worked great. Then, I took it on a hike in the mountains with lots of snow. It worked great the entire time and did not get wet, as it was not actively snowing or raining. The next morning, camera wouldn't turn on. No error message or anything. So I took it to the store I bought it from because it was still under warranty. They sent it to Canon and a few weeks later, I got a message that it was irreparable and not covered under warranty due to \"excessive water damage.\" I was shocked and extremely angry because it never got any wetter than a few rain drops and the day that it stopped working, it did not get wet at all. My boyfriend did the same hike with a Canon Mark II and his camera was totally fine. I am not sure if it was the cold temperatures or moisture in the air that ruined both my Canon Rebels or if they are just crap quality and decide to die randomly. Either way, I have spent way too much money on what appears to be a \"disposable\" camera that only lasts a few months. Unless you live in a perpetually sunny and dry area, do not buy this camera if you plan on taking it outside. Given that I only use my cameras to take nature photography when hiking, I will not be buying another Canon product. I am now looking into the weather-resistant Pentax cameras."},{"reviewerName":"David C.","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Do not order this product","reviewDate":"March 1, 2018","reviewText":"Do not order this product."},{"reviewerName":"pamendella","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Charger won't work","reviewDate":"December 17, 2018","reviewText":"Ordered this package for 4 month study abroad journey.
