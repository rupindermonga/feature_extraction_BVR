If I put the 300mm lens or any use one of the wide angle lenses in addition to the 18-55mm, it works fine. Only using the lens by itself does it act up. Researching shows me this is a junk lens and many people are having issues with it. 1 star for now until seller responds with a solution. For $500, I should be able to use my camera without hassle and this is only day 2 with it. Making me very nervous that a product at this price point can be so finnicky.\n\nJan 2nd Edit: Seller contacted me and told me to call Nikon \"as it might be a setting issue\". Super awesome since this is a Canon T6. Regardless, the camera works fine with my buddies STM lens and all of the other included lens' and I have factory reset the device and all settings back to default but the 18-55mm lens will not manual ot auto focus no matter the conditions.\n\nJan 2nd second edit:. Tried the \"snap ring\" trick and now it's focusing again. Not sure what to think of this lens but I ordered the STM lens just incase this is not a permanent fix. Updating to 3 stars as the camera and bundle is well worth the price. Removed 2 stars for customer service being below par and the fact the lens already had an issue."},{"reviewerName":"Snappinphotography","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Everything that came","reviewDate":"December 1, 2018","reviewText":"I have been enjoying this new camera (it’s my new first camera), and so far I love it. Everything came well packaged and secured. It was really nice to see that everything came as it said it would (even in their own original new box). It was easy to access and use. Side note; if you do have trouble with understanding how to work your camera, googling videos on the camera type is super helpful. That’s how I was able to learn.\nI did notice that some people were complaining about the stand, or how most of the stuff didn’t come, or the quality of the pictures were bad. All is not true. The stand is tall, it’s not short or hard to utilize. It really depends on your knowledge and level of cameras. It does take time to learn and practice. Everything does come as shown in images, you just have to put them together or do a checklist!\n\nI have put everything I received into images and detailed the little accessory in case you didn’t get what you were suppose to get or if you need any of these items (in case it gets lost)."},{"reviewerName":"Rachel L.

I am not a picture type of guy when traveling or going to events, normally preferring to enjoy the moment. But I would like to capture some memories.\n\nAnyways, I read a lot of reviews on different sites and decided to take the plunge with this camera. My thought process was that it seemed like a very solid camera, not necessarily the best at anything but solid at most things, and if I did get to the point where I am feeling limited my the camera, then it did its job and I could 'graduate' to a more expensive, more full-featured camera. If I do not get into photography as much as I think I will, then I am not out a ton of money.\n\nThe first thing you notice when you get this is just how much stuff it comes with. It is like Christmas. You open the camera, then the lenses, then the filters, then the accessories, and then more and more and more. It is great!\n\nI read the entire manual before starting so I would have a good understanding of what all of the settings and buttons do. It seems intuitive enough as a point and shoot camera, but I wanted to make sure I knew the ins and outs in the beginning. Great manual, comprehensive and still easy to understand.\n\nFinally, I have started taking photos and have been very pleased with the results. Again, I am not a photography expert, but it has done what I have expected it to do.\n\nAll in all, I would consider this a great purchase. This might not be for the experienced photographer (or maybe it is, what do I know), but it is perfect for me and I imagine it would be perfect for anybody looking to dip their toe into the world of photography before the wanted to commit to a seriosly expensive set of kit."},{"reviewerName":"Doniecia Thomas","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"so far am happy with the choice I made","reviewDate":"June 8, 2017","reviewText":"Brought this camera for my birthday, so far am happy with the choice I made."},{"reviewerName":"Starbuck M.","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great camera","reviewDate":"September 7, 2018","reviewText":"Great camera, great images. Before i bought this camera i always read the reviews and i noticed there was people that put the extras were not worth it. My guess is that they dont know how to use them. For example the external flash, this flash does not connect onto the camera. Use the arm that comes with it, and when your cameras flash goes off the external goes off as well. It takes great pictures, you just need to know how to adjust the settings. By reading the manual or youtube."},{"reviewerName":"Isabella","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Perfect for a Beginner!","reviewDate":"April 7, 2019","reviewText":"I've had the camera for about two weeks now and it's been great! The automatic settings have produced some really good pictures, but I've also enjoyed experimenting with the different settings. I also love all of the accessories that this camera came with! Amazon had a bunch of bundle packs, but I settled with this one because of the 75-300mm lens which is included -- a super zoom lens which on it's own costs about $100. This bundle shipped very quickly and arrived with all of the accessories advertised. I haven't tried out all of the features included (such as the flash, telephoto and wide angle lens, and UV filters), but am excited to do so! I would definitely recommend this camera to anyone new to photography or someone looking to easily take high quality photos, and I would recommend this bundle in particular because of the bonus high quality lens included and the extra storage SD cards."},{"reviewerName":"Maggie","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Perfect Pictures!","reviewDate":"January 21, 2019","reviewText":"So long as you understand how to use a camera in general, this takes fantastic photos!

Some of the equipment is cheaply made.","reviewDate":"June 10, 2019","reviewText":"I bought this as a starter DSLR. The camera takes some really nice pictures. There are soooo many features and settings that I'm still training myself on them and expect to remain self training for a good, long time. (there are books available to train more easily)\nOn the downside, the Vivitar lenses and the tripods are all low quality.... the lenses are alright for a total newbie like me but I'd definitely keep an eye out for replacements for each of the non-canon components. The tall tripod broke on first use and some of the Vivitar lenses do not attach to camera without a good deal of frustration for a lens that's supposed to be screw on. I took my first set of pics out in the wintry cold and the battery didn't handle it all that well. To be fair, it was Darn Cold. My cell phone battery also died from that chill.\nFor the price, it's an okay buy. I'm still shooting with it and that says something about the quality of the pics.\nOverall, I'd recommend it as a good camera for the newbie. Buy your own QUALITY tripod though."},{"reviewerName":"Theresa Flynn","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Yes, and No, and Yes","reviewDate":"February 18, 2019","reviewText":"The camera itself is a great option in this price range for something solid which will give you a good number of options for nice pictures. Easy to work with, it has a battery which lasts a nice long time between charges. Full disclosure, I like the Canon brand and have always used their cameras. Complaints include issues with the wifi, accessories and shipping. The wifi is designed to connect to your phone, for viewing the pictures, period. No, it will not connect to any wifi and upload your pictures to the cloud, as I hoped, and the multiple software packages you must download are bulky and not user-friendly (and did not work with my Android phone). Mostly, I just connect the cable to my laptop and yank photos into my computer's hard drive. This accessory package includes some items of interest (multiple lenses) and some not, such as filters. The non-Canon items are alternately flimsy (table-top tripod) or difficult to use (two of the lens extenders don't thread well into the Canon lenses). I additionally had an issue with shipping. I waited \"a good long time\" for this to go on sale and then the shipper lost the item. I contacted the retailer, who replied \"Upon reviewing your order details, I see that Amazon was the one that fulfilled and shipped your order, so it's solely in their hands to assist you with the package lost in transit.\" I contacted Amazon, who said \"This is a third-party order. You must contact the seller to resolve delivery issues.\" I was furious. Bottom line: I would not order from this vendor again and I will not order expensive items from Amazon again if they are from a \"third-party seller\". Despite all the hassles, this is a decent camera and I am glad to own it."},{"reviewerName":"KG","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Expansive Kit for first-time DSLR owner","reviewDate":"January 13, 2019","reviewText":"Love this camera and set so far. Don't know what I'll use everything for yet, but I'm excited to find out! I don't have much occasion to use the slave flash but that thing is legit.

I would recommend that one be familiar with the basic settings available on a point and shoot (preferably of matching brand for easy transfer of knowledge) so that the transition doesn't feel quite so overwhelming. That being said, there's always trial and error, and when the photographs are digital, who cares how many times you have to try to get it right?"},{"reviewerName":"A.

I have a lot of trouble getting the auto focus to act right and always use manual instead, the 'close up' setting does not in fact let you take very close up pictures, it doesn't take very true to color pictures and the pictures aren't as clear as my last camera of the same value and brand.

One thing is the panels on the camera can be a bit finicky.\n\nTHE BAG\nThe bag could be bigger but I've gotten everything to fit inside of it, though uncomfortably.\n\nTHE TRIPOD\nThe tripod broke within 2 uses. I do not recommend getting a tripod from Vivitar. Tripod is cheap and plastic and will break on you while in use which can potentially damage the very expensive camera. Screws of the tripod just decided to fall out and the handle moves way too easily, if moved to the left on accident (which is easily to do because it doesn't lock in place very well at all) the plate area becomes loose and the plate area will just fall and if a camera were to be on it, the camera would hit the legs of the tripod potentially damaging the camera.

Other than the Canoncamera and lenses I believe all the products are of inferior quality. I even tried to return the whole bundle but the seller stated they had a 30 day return policy which I missed by 7 days. They did say, however, that the manufacturer of the two items mentioned above had a one year warranty. The bigger problem, as I see it, is that the bundle is described in such a way that one expects all the equipment to be as high in quality as the Canon products. This is not the case with this bundle.\n\nI am not returning the two broken items because their replacements will be similarly low in quality.\n\nFinally, I purchased this bundle entirely because of the price.

Every camera has its strong points and its drawbacks. This one needs a slave flash..meaning you have to attach one (which comes in this bundle) It may be a little less convenient than built -in flash, but it is sometimes worth it to eliminate the glare of a close up flash, which wipes the fine details.Better yet, you can attach it to a tripod,(also included) to eliminate accidental movement, and take it without flash!

Spending quite some time on deciding what bundle to purchase, we decided on this one. We are truly satisfied with the camera and the lenses and filters that came with the camera. Even the carry bag. Professionally packaged, manual included, and just all round a feel of quality. We've taken some pictures by now, and we are amazed at the quality of the images, and ease with which the camera takes those great images. My wife has actually entered some in the local fair to compete with the much more seasoned professionals. The lost star of this bundle is due to the included tripod. It was a cheap item which broke during shipping, and is too cheap of an item to justify returning the bundle. Amazon did give us a nice cash refund, but my recommendation would be, buy a bundle without a tripod, and spend the money buying a decent tripod."},{"reviewerName":"James McBryde","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Four Stars","reviewDate":"January 5, 2017","reviewText":"best camera i ever had it takes od pic."},{"reviewerName":"Lucia Ceballos","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Five Stars","reviewDate":"June 5, 2017","reviewText":"Everything in perfect conditions"},{"reviewerName":"Valentina Grosso","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"so happy with my","reviewDate":"March 2, 2017","reviewText":"exclente, so happy with my camera"},{"reviewerName":"Jennifer","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Five Stars","reviewDate":"February 21, 2017","reviewText":"Great product and a very good value."},{"reviewerName":"Maksim Semizhon","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Four Stars","reviewDate":"July 8, 2016","reviewText":"Camera and lenses are okay but other is useless(especially tripod and external falsh)"},{"reviewerName":"andy pierce","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Cannon camera","reviewDate":"April 26, 2016","reviewText":"Great camera better price everything you need"},{"reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Five Stars","reviewDate":"January 21, 2017","reviewText":"Excelente!"},{"reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Five Stars","reviewDate":"December 29, 2016","reviewText":"Very satisfied"},{"reviewerName":"Breanne M.","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Five Stars","reviewDate":"May 12, 2016","reviewText":"Wonderful camera and the package of stuff it comes with exceeded my expectations."},{"reviewerName":"Karen","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Five Stars","reviewDate":"June 4, 2016","reviewText":"Love the whole package"},{"reviewerName":"Mark M.","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"A good camera with a lot of","reviewDate":"June 19, 2016","reviewText":"My third Rebel.

I also purchased my camera from photo for less because of the reviews I read about them. When I received my package it had everything they described. I was not disappointed with any of the items even tho there are a couple of things that are relatively cheap. The camera and two main lenses were my biggest concern and they are perfect. I did have a question about the other lenses. I contacted photo for less via email and not only got a quick response but an explanation as well. They even invited me to call and gave a phone number if I had any questions. Kudos to photo for less."},{"reviewerName":"alon reshef","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Excellent camera, sharp colors","reviewDate":"August 14, 2016","reviewText":"Excellent camera , sharp colors , easy to use, good wifi connection with smartphones .\nOne thing , if possible I would change the small lane to wider range ~28-80 or similar so it provide better range"},{"reviewerName":"Karl","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Excellent camera kit for the money","reviewDate":"June 8, 2016","reviewText":"I bought this as a gift for my daughter's wedding and took a bunch of pictures pre wedding. So I gave a used gift! However, it allowed me to see it's functionality and ease of use in video and still mode.

Defrank","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"I had been a former user of film SLR back in the day and I think that this is an excellent choice for both beginners and seasone","reviewDate":"January 29, 2017","reviewText":"Bought this for my wife as her first SLR and she loves the quality of the photos and versatility compared to the point and shoot she had used. I had been a former user of film SLR back in the day and I think that this is an excellent choice for both beginners and seasoned photogs. The 2 kit lenses are adequate and I supplemented them with a Canon 50mm which is very good. The extra goodies included in the package are nice, but they are somewhat low quality. The external flash is a Slave flash and pretty cheap in my opinion, but overall a good choice."},{"reviewerName":"Gas Man","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Beginner photographer","reviewDate":"August 16, 2016","reviewText":"I'm not a professional photographer, or anywhere close to being a professional, but I do know how to use a camera, if it looks clear, take the picture and if it's not clear don't take it.
