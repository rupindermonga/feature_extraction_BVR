I am from the old school of photography that existed way before digital invaded SLRs. That being said, I've adapted. (lol). This camera does a great job of offering up great 'advice' in the provided automated settings. It's accurate for lighting in most situations. If you learn to use the light meter settings properly to account for difficult lighting situations (ie, beach & snow & highly dappled situations), you will be able to use this camera and get very professional grade photos. That is, if you can see well enough to focus. (or, you can rely on autofocus- but you need to make sure you use the focal function setting that will only focus on the main target). My biggest gripe with all these new cameras and lenses is that they no longer provide a split screen for focusing manually. My eyesight is not as good as when I was young and I need glasses. I can't count on my eyesight for perfect focus anymore. That split screen was my insurance. Now, you need to either have very accurate glasses or you need to trust the autofocus. Personally, I hate losing that control over my photos. If you are extremely picky about how you like to compose your photos, use your aperture for focal effects, etc, these new digital cameras don't generally include the split screen focal ability. Ok. Enough of my singular gripe. Other than that, this camera offers several 'stupid proof' settings for various lighting scenarios- ie, portrait, sport, etc. If you select one for the described condition, the camera does a very nice job of selecting the right aperture and speed settings. This camera is also designed for video. I haven't tested how well the video works yet, but Canon is a leader in all areas- they have been upgrading their video capabilities for some time now. My daughter's rebel (one version older) has great video function so I will assume this one does as well. I will update if it's not true.\n\nI LOVE that this camera comes with a pop up flash AND an additional flash which can be used in so many different ways. it allows extra light in super dark conditions or two directions of light which can be synched with a cable.\n\nI also LOVE the two different stands that come with this package. The tall stand is a little CHEAP, but if you are just getting started, it will do. Just don't abuse it and it should last a couple years, I would think. Don't lose any screws or parts that fall off- put them back on the stand to ensure you don't lose them. Repair at home or on the spot. It's pretty basic. The little stand is very efficient and handy for times when hauling a big one is not reasonable (for example, if you are a climber, hiker, biker, etc. ).\n\nI also LOVE the two lenses that come with the camera. The basic lense is a standard close to mid range zoom. It will cover almost all your basic photography needs. Even from quite a distance. But if you are wishing to take super long distant shots (like the moon, far off vulcanos popping over the cloud tops, animals at Yellowstone, etc,) the longer zoom is your perfect option. What's great about the two lenses is that they have the same size opening. That means you can use filters, attaching lenses and other lense accessories for both of them- in other words, you don't need to buy two sets of all these things, which can be very expensive and heavy to carry around.\n\nThis camera also has two additional screw on 'helper lenses'. These are not true lenses in that they don't attach to your camera directly. They attach to the lenses. One is a wide angle lense (will allow you to see more to the sides of your normal view) and the other is a telephoto lense (that doubles the magnification of what you normally see through the lense.) As mentioned before, these fit both lenses.\n\nHAPPY it comes with the filters. While these are not clearly explained in the product description, these are neutral density filters that basically protect your lense glass. You will want to put one on each lense. CLEAN your lense and the filters with the PROVIDED KIT only. Blow all dust off both the lense and filter and only then put the filter on. make sure all moisture is dried up first. This will protect your lense. Believe me, you WILL scratch your lense. Better to scratch a cheap filter than your real lense.\n\nTHRILLED about getting TWO batteries so that you can juice both up and go out on a long hike or camping trip without running out of battery. So, so important.\n\nLOVE that this Cannon set includes THREE ways to transfer your photo files: you can plug the memory chip into a device directly if your device accepts its size. You can use the digital stick with a standard USB plug that will fit into any computer. You can use the WI-FI option of the camera to directly upload to the internet or any device with Bluetooth capabilities. Now THAT's flexibility!\n\nLast, but not least, is the FUN and sometimes necessary REMOTE CONTROL. This assortment of extra features included in this kit could, alone, cost many hundreds if bought together. I find it remarkable to get all of them together, with a bag and shoulder strap for under $500. The camera and lenses alone could cost that amount in a camera shop.\n\nWell, I hope this was useful for you. If so, give me a thumbs up. I review quite a few products and films but I get a little frustrated when it seems they aren't helpful to people. Let me know if you find this helpful, ok? If so, I will keep giving these types of reviews."},{"reviewerName":"Girlygrrl","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Research paid off! Great Camera!","reviewDate":"September 19, 2017","reviewText":"I did so much research before purchasing this camera and am glad I did. I wanted a DSLR camera that not only took GREAT photos for Instagram but videos for YouTube. I also wanted it to be easy to transfer my media to my computer or phone for editing and posting. This camera is great so far...One thing I didn't even think about was the weight of the camera with lens. This camera is super light and easy to carry with me and on top of that takes amazing photos! The accessories that came in the kit from Ritz Camera were great and just the icing on the top. I do like that the camera bag and strap are actually Canon brand but I will be purchasing a bigger bag to carry all of my supplies. I haven't had a chance to play with the video at this point but a couple of tips with the photos:\n#1 Make sure you put your camera strap on right away. It is a life saver if you trip (not that I every do that) or want easy access.\n#2 Change the auto off setting. The standard setting is 30 seconds and I found that to be way too short when staging a photo.\n#3 (This may be a no brainer for all of you but honestly it stumped me at first) To use the additional lenses, you just twist them on to the base Canon lens.\n\nSo my overall rating is 5 out of 5 at this point!\n\nThis is just a preliminary posting as I haven't tried out all of the bells and whistles yet but am super please with Ritz Camera and the kit that they put together."},{"reviewerName":"Daniel Grover","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Terrific Bundle!","reviewDate":"May 18, 2017","reviewText":"I would recommend this as a starter kit for any amateur photographer or hobbiest out there.\nMy only recommendation for purchaser's would be to buy a few extra camera batteries.\nThe 18 mega pixels​ this has gives beautiful images that are easy to work with when cropping and enlarging during photo editing.\nI've added a couple of photos to show you what this can do right out of the box."},{"reviewerName":"Kayla","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"WOW WOW WOW!!","reviewDate":"February 12, 2018","reviewText":"As much research as I did, you CANNOT beat this deal!! It felt like a huge risk buying it from amazon and I noticed some reviews said some things were missing, I was so worried about spending so much money and something go wrong... but I am SO GLAD I took that risk!!!! It was perfect! Everything was there. I even had the canon bag ( I’m assuming it’s because I chose the premium bundle!) but the bag really only fits, ( the camera, and the lenses and a couple small items) so I will be buying a bigger bag anyways so none of that made a difference to me. Seriously, the camera was in perfect condition, everything. I registered the camera with canon too! The gear that comes with it really is great, I mean some of it you can tell is cheap but does it work? YES! It all works. I think everything works fine except the flash drive, the metal piece for the USB port came off, but I wasn’t going to use a flash drive anyways.

It came in an enormous box and everyone was so confused on what it was and as we started opening it, it was my kit! I was going to take a picture of everything inside but I was way too excited. The camera is amazing quality and I love the whole kit. I think I would've been fine without all four lenses since I'm a beginner photographer but I'll find a way to use it. I like how simplistic the camera is and the automated settings, it's easy to use and figure out. I did wish that the camera came with a warranty because I didn't really want to pay an extra $40, but it was alright. The 75-300mm lens is heavy with the camera and I wasn't expecting it, but you do get used it as I did.

The only camera he has ever used was the one on his smartphone. He LOVES this camera. It has a great package for anyone new to photography. He is still learning, but he is learning fast. A lot of reviews mentioned the low quality of the accessories, are they the highest quality? Maybe not, we honestly wouldnt know, but everything in his kit has worked.\nNow, the spare battery was missing from our shipment. I contacted amazon, then sent a message to the seller. These guys immediately sent out the spare battery. We got it within a couple of days. The communication was fantastic and they were very prompt with their response.\nFor this price you get everything you need to start taking pictures in a variety of settings. Yes the tripod is short, and? It works. My son even put that thing in a tree. (I almost had a heart attack seeing his new camera perched up there) I got him a taller tripod that extends for $5, he carries both and uses both.\nThe case that came with it will fit the whole kit in it.\nThe card reader and SD cards all worked. We plugged the card reader into my laptop and it read with no problems.\nHe hasnt used the filters much yet, but they were of course tried out . He said they work. Now we just need to pick up a remote and this kid is set.\nWe're new to photography, but we are very happy with this camera and everything that came with it."},{"reviewerName":"Corey R.","rating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"... not the 32GB other than that the camera is great loved it","reviewDate":"November 16, 2016","reviewText":"This didn't come with everything it says it does I only got one tripod the 8\" not the bigger one and one SD card the 16gb not the 32GB other than that the camera is great loved it!!

It was easy to get connected to my phone and ipad and get my pictures using the Canon Camera Connect app. The bundle seems fine - mine had all the items listed. I already had the lenses plus a few others but it never hurts to have some extras. The bag is really nice as well though I already have a bag (backpack style).

It does take really nice pictures also (just like my older model does)."},{"reviewerName":"Thor","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Overall pretty much perfect.","reviewDate":"September 11, 2016","reviewText":"First of all: Everything works, no damaged items, no used/refurbished items ''smuggled'' in. :-)\nCons first: The little tripod is not really usable without remote, too shaky and unstable. Flash light, well... pretty cheap one. Same goes for the cleaning set. Why there's a 3 way level when the tripod has levels is beyond me. Maybe I should pay more attention to keeping my camera level. :-) The packaging itself looked a little bit like they used all the leftover packaging material and threw the items in a box to get out of the door on time and watch the game. A little more love packing stuff wouldn't hurt.\nPros: Pretty good (big) tripod with bubble levels works just fine. The four(!) lenses are good (Canon and Polaroid) and not cheap no-name finds from China. The memory cards are fast ones, 16 + 32 gb is a lot when starting out. The filters are good as well and playing around is a lot of fun. The bag is a decent size, camera and the two big lenses fit without a problem, the quality of the bag is ok (Not a canon bag!). You can move the dividers around and make them fit just right.\nLast but not least the camera itself: No need to get a book in order to snap good pictures, a lot of thinking is done by the camera and the preset scenes. Works like a charm. Changing the presets takes some time to figure out, but that's just my ''I don't/want need a manual'' approach. After a day on the couch putting all the pieces together and taking them apart again, I must say the camera works better than I expected. I was torn between T6 and T6i, good thing I went with the T6. This camera can do everything a non-professional photographer will ever need, even movies. The set is pretty much perfect, with a few exceptions. I would have liked a remote in the set, but that's not a deal breaker at all.\nI am very happy with the camera and the set and would recommend to a friend. With Ritz Camera I think I found a good and reliable supplier for further purchases."},{"reviewerName":"J.

Well worth every penny!"},{"reviewerName":"Chewd","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Useless for video","reviewDate":"December 27, 2018","reviewText":"Here is the email i wrote to Canon about this camera:\n\nI recently purchased a Canon Rebel T6 1300D DSLR camera. I intended to use this camera ostensibly for shooting videos of sunsets, babbling brooks and beach scenery. I use these videos to calm my nerves and have been looking for a good quality camera capable of shooting 1080p video without too much hassle. Canon is a good reputable brand, and so i purchased this camera.\n\nThe descriptions i read about this camera all said that it was capable of filming 1080p video. What they failed to mention is that the camera can only film 1080p video for 11 minutes before it shuts itself off & you have to start it up again. It does this because of the 4gb filesize limit of the storage media.\n\nOther manufacturers get around this by coding the firmware to record the video in 4gb segments which are later stitched together. For some reason your cameras are not capable of doing this.\n\nWell actually they ARE perfectly capable of doing this, but only after installing some 3rd party firmware called Magic Lantern, which is a procedure which would of course void the warranty. Since i had just paid nearly $500 for this camera, i was not willing to do that. So instead i have returned the camera & will purchase another camera from one of your competitors. I'm currently leaning towards a Panasonic.\n\nI wanted to write you and let you know about this. It seems sad, pathetic even, that open-source hobbyists are capable of writing better firmware for your cameras than you yourselves are. Even sadder is that you cant even be bothered to go look at their code (which is open source, available to all) and implement these very useful features into your product line. The only explanation i can think of for this lunacy is that your R&D department must be extremely lazy, either that or for some reason you want your products to have these severe design flaws.\n\nAnyway, in the short term it has cost you a sale... in the long term i'll never again see anything from canon as being a quality product.\n\nIf it was my company i would want to know about this so I could take steps to fix it.\n\n--Thank you"},{"reviewerName":"Jack Schilling","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Watch the child-like desire for more....","reviewDate":"March 31, 2018","reviewText":"Camera, memory card and table/flexible tri-pod are about all that is good about this package. The camera is of course AMAZING. The external flash is cheap, filters can be applied even in a smart phone, tri-pod is too short - even for a 5ft 1in frame, and the extra lenses are mediocre at best. The included case is not large enough for the basics in this package.\n\nSince I received this, I purchased a larger case, a larger tri-pod, a better flash, a couple of hoods and a flash diffuser.... Now I have a complete package!\n\nIf it wasn't for the camera, I would rate this one star. Advice to anyone looking??? Buy the camera and memory card, the rest you can put together for cheaper and with better products."},{"reviewerName":"John M.","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"very happy with the purchase","reviewDate":"July 20, 2017","reviewText":"Overall, very happy with the purchase. My wife has some problems with hand tremors, and it helps to have a viewfinder instead of just the LCD screen so that she can hold it closer to the body and brace. Plus having the auto stabilization on the main lens helps. An SLR is a bit overkill here, but very few cameras now have that viewfinder unless you are up the price scale a ways, so decided to go this route after reading reviews. And frankly, too small and light is actually not as stable for her, anyway.\nAutofocus is fast and accurate, although a little care needs to be made to center the subject for the focus. Found a few where the main subject was out of center, and one of the focus points caught something else. With the camera in full program mode, it has still taken a number of excellent pictures just during testing, balancing focus and exposure well with depth of field.\nHad purchased my last SLR (Minolta X700) from Ritz storefront about 25 years ago, and was just as happy with customer service this time. Like some others have posted, ours actually had only a 16GB card instead of the second 32GB, and only one battery instead of two. After sending Ritz an email, they shipped out the additional items the next day, and I received those within a week.\nHave not had time to verify that everything functions correctly, yet - my wife left with the camera and basic lens and the table tripod for a vacation a couple of days after we got it. We'll see how she did when she returns, and I'll test the remainder then.\nThe only downside which I see at all is that the case is a bit small for all of the components. That's really about it - as far as a kit goes, pretty inclusive. And a well rated camera for someone not needing too many professional-level functions. So far, I recommend it.\nEdit - for those who did not receive the extra battery and the larger memory card - I contacted Ritz through Amazon and received a reply the next day. I hope that this helps you - they literally sent the additional parts immediately with no questions. I think that they realize that there is some mix up between the 4-lens kit and the 4-lens PREMIUM kit, which were the same price when I purchased."},{"reviewerName":"mike c","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Check your bundle package very carefully","reviewDate":"March 18, 2019","reviewText":"I’m just getting into photography as a hobby and I picked this camera and bundle based on other reviews and research.

I also bought some things including the 1st lens, lens cleaner, and the USB splitter(In the video) Other then that, everything inside the box if whats included in this bundle. I think its a great deal. I also suggest buying a different lens cleaner kit because the one included is way too small, and doesn't have everything you need. The small tri-pod is a 8 inches and the 50\" is made of plastic but is still good for holding your camera in place. You only get 1 battery so make sure you buy a spare. you get about 3 days standby, and 7 hours while its on. so very good battery, might be more or less depending. The flash requires AA batteries, so make sure you get some if you plan on buying this kit.

There are plenty of reviews out there on the T6 by people a lot more qualified than I am. I purchased the \"Premium 4-Lens Bundle\" for my 100 level Intro to Photography class.\nI have really enjoyed this kit but there are some drawbacks. Everything out of the Canon box is top notch, I really like that it comes with both lens and a nice bag. Something I noticed was there isn't enough room to keep the 75-300mm lens on the camera in the Canon bag. The Ritz Gear lenses are nice, but you'll probably have to clean up the treads to remove plastic from the lens caps. The 12-inch tripod is really sturdy in the legs, but the head will not support the camera; I threw it in with my GoPro accessories. The screen protector is a cut to fit style so I didn't mess with trying to install it. I will probably order a model specific protector here soon. I found the shutter button very helpful when I was trying to take long exposure photos on an overpass and didn't have time to mess with connecting my phone to the camera. It feels solid, but it's not an overly sturdy unit. The Card Reader is about as basic as it gets, I haven't tried it with an SD card, but I couldn't get my Micro SD card to read; it may have been user error due to poor markings. The Slave flash is nice and bright, however, it's pretty lightweight and the clamshell does not feel sturdy. The SD Card and extra battery are really nice to have and come in handy a lot(note the extra battery is not a Canon battery. As for the tripod, throw it out or use it for lighting. The legs are thin aluminum and everything else is poorly molded plastic. Right out of the bag the tripod had nuts and bolts falling off and plastic left on it from the molding process. The head is poorly fitted plastic and there is a lot of play in the quick detach. I would be hesitant about mounting my GoPro to it on a windy day.\nOverall this has been a great starter kit for me, just be prepared to slowly upgrade this accessory bundle."},{"reviewerName":"Joe M","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Bundle priced fairly","reviewDate":"September 16, 2018","reviewText":"I received this and it is not what I expected.

This wouldn't be an issue other than I left the real battery on charge at home when I went to my brother's wrestling match.

There are a ton of supplies that you need, besides a camera, that videographers have to keep in mind when buying a set - an extra battery, tripod, filters, extra sandisk, etc. This pack meets a lot of those requirements for photo, but not for video. Here is why.\nThe TRIPOD is excellent for grabbing studio photos, is a great height, very stable, and very light. For video however, its far too cheap, sticky, and clunky for any kind of panning or product shots - when adjusting, it skips and jumps instead of moving smoothly.\nThe camera KIT LENS, the 18-55mm, is fantastic for photography - really gets you a pleasant range of shot styles from 35mm-50mm portraits, to nice wide shots at the 18mm for selfie style videos and the like. Photos come out clean and with minimal distortion (to an amateur photographers eye). For video however, the lenses are not very functional. The zooming and focus ring (even during manual focus) are very audible in video, making it impossible to use unless youre using external audio. Also, the minimum aperture (f/4.5) is simply not enough for indoor or nighttime shooting, even at its widest, shots come out blurry, soft, and slightly noisy.\nThe CAMERA itself, while fabulous for photography, cannot stand the rigors of videography. The sensor manages to grab beautiful photos, but the videos - even in broad daylight - comes out soft and slightly low quality. And during low light, the camera is simply unable to capture any usable video at all - a modern iphone could probably do better. (Of course, this is with the kit lens - a 50mm prime f/1.8 should do much better in low light, but thats an additional $50-$125.)\nThe 75-300 ZOOM LENS is barely usable also - at the far end of the zoom, the distortion makes even the photos look fuzzy. The aperture limit makes it usable only for daylight and high light environments, such as maybe sport photography, but the lens distortion is too strong at deeper focus - youd be better off just not spending the extra $64 on it.\nThe included WIDE ANGLE LENS attachment is kitchy and lovable, but of course comes with heavy distortion, and can only be used for more artistic and less creatively restrictive photos. The TELEPHOTO LENS attachment is clunky and almost never necessary. In the time you take to put it on, you could just move closer to your subject, because the amount of zoom it gives you is negligible compared to the distortion it puts on the image.\nThe included FLASH is very small, and has a very short affectable distance (5-7ft @night). It is not usable for street photography, except at night, and not at sunset. However, it is highly portable, and can be super useful in a pinch.\nThe other auxiliary equipment the kit comes with is super useful - lens cleaners, usb chip readers, etc, but those things arent as expensive as you think they are and arent necessary to buy up front. After buying this kit, the only things that I actually use (being an amateur videographer and photographer) are the camera with kit lens, tripod, spare batteries, strap, sd chip, and included flash, all of which could be bought at a higher quality, separately, for a similar price.\nHonestly, If you are starting out just shooting photo, save the money and just buy this camera with the kit lens, a nice big san disk, a flash, and a tripod, and then once you feel comfortable, grab some cheap prime lenses with more low light power. You'll end up with less crap you wont use."},{"reviewerName":"James M.

But after adjusting the battery extender I had purchased separately, she fired right up... since then, I have been in love with this kit. It really came with just about everything I knew a novice would need, and even some touches I would have overlooked. A great buy!\n\nUPDATE: After using the camera for about a month, I have chosen to drop it down a notch on my star rating. Partly in fact that the camera has no microphone port and therefore only picks up sound from its internal mic, which sadly, is as good as listening to someone speak through a tunnel. Wonderful camera for a novice and would recommend to any family for its excellent imagery and affordability."},{"reviewerName":"Jessica Monsorno","rating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Everything NOT included in bundle","reviewDate":"February 2, 2018","reviewText":"There are items missing from my order: 57” Tripod and carrying case, the high capacity LPE10 replacement battery, and the lens cap strap.

I have not used it in a variety of situations, so the versatility rating is limited, but under the different conditions I've tried the camera have not disappointed. I have an older DSLR that is so heavy; this is much lighter. My old camera has a lens that combines the lengths of the two lenses included with this camera, so I may find it a little more cumbersome to switch lenses with the circumstances. While I wasn't in need of most of the accessories, this kit was a little less expensive than buying the camera/2 lenses with bag plus an SD card and extra battery, so the rest of the stuff was just gravy as I have cleaning supplies, tripods, etc."},{"reviewerName":"mwzsr","rating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"After opening the package and realizing that some of the ...","reviewDate":"February 14, 2018","reviewText":"After opening the package and realizing that some of the products they advertised incorrect.

I would really thread carefully.\n\nThe thing about buying a camera package through mail is that you really don't know what you are getting, or the quality of the equipment.\n\nI have owned about 5 Canon cameras that I bought new and never had any issues. So what is the issue with this package? The quality is just terrible. Let's start with the lenses - they are garbage. The 2 extra lenses are poor quality and will make your pics be out of focus most of the time. They are just really cheap lenses and makes everything look blurred most of the time.\n\nThe standard lens that comes with the camera is just as awful, nothing special here, but at least you won't have out of focus problems as you will with the other two lenses.\n\nThe camera itself is okay, but like I said, this is the least good quality I've gotten from all of my Canon purchases.\n\nIt's too late to return the camera for me. Now my option is to spend a lot more money for some good quality lenses - and see if this will solve the quality issue.

The one star reduction is for the RITZ GEAR accessories. The Slave Flash does not work in the slave mode, and the two smaller lens are of poor quality. The camera with accessory kit was $50 more than just the camera and the 2 cannon lens kit...so, I got 2 tripods, some lens filters and cheap lens cleaning kit for $50.

Haven't had it long enough to give a proper review, but everything included seems to be of decent quality, the camera is gorgeous and all of the buttons are smarty placed and accessible, more so than the last 3 older Rebels I've used. Tactile feedback on the buttons is good. Do not plan on fitting everything into the camera bag, you will not be able to. But I do like minimal pocket design of the bag, you get the main compartment with an adjustable divider, and one large pocket outside of that, as opposed to 8 or 9 little tiny pockets everywhere that don't properly fit anything."},{"reviewerName":"Angelle Tirado","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Battery Life Sucks.","reviewDate":"June 22, 2019","reviewText":"From the moment I received this camera the battery never fully charged.

I think this is the perfect beginners camera for anyone that loves photography. I especially love all of the equipment that came with this bundle! We also purchased a 50 mm 1.8 to go along with this camera. The camera takes really good video but it's not a camera that you would want to use for video on a regular basis because it doesn't have a flip screen. The shutter speed is 3 fps which is slow so it's not idea for taking pictures of sports or any other fast paced action shots but it's good for portraits and street photography. It's not too heavy so it's the perfect light-weight camera so overall we love the camera and highly recommend it!

We had a Rebel XTI, which was much more expensive, but the quality and ease of taking pictures of this camera is better, and the Rebel T6 cost was much less with tons of extras. Since we had a Rebel XTl before, to use them is similar, which helped. The Rebel XTI camera physical quality was better, this camera is made lighter, and to me, of less quality materials, but works great. It takes clear, quality pictures in all sorts of lighting. The only issues we had so far was initial setup was difficult.

When the box arrived I inventoried all the parts immediately. We were missing the second battery. The filter pack and lens cleaning kit were a different brand. Otherwise everything else was exactly what was listed. I called amazon right away and we took care of the battery without having to reorder the entire kit. Even with marketplace sellers, the reason I repeatedly buy on amazon is the phenomenal customer service when you need it. A company is better judged by how mistakes are fixed. So the kit itself is just amazing. I was going to grab the camera at Costco bit for the same price only included the bag and 1 SD card. This gave me every accessory her instructor asked for without hunting and it was just a great value."},{"reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"The BEST way to bundle a camera package","reviewDate":"September 1, 2016","reviewText":"This is the only way to get a real camera deal!

I especially love the case, as I have seen others where the proper configuration of the velcro dividers is a total mystery but this one came all set up and has great compartments sizes and places. The legs of the small tripod seem to have a bit of trouble staying fully extended when holding the heavy camera and lens, but that is a minor thing.

I purchased 2 sets one for each of my sons who have a serious photography hobby.\nThe product is a great bang for the buck , everything you can want in a great starter kit.\nThere was an initial problem with the tri-pods both had a malfunction on either end of the same piece making them inoperable,\nBut to my great pleasure Amazon did a great job of giving me understanding and awesome customer service. But if I have to commend, anyone it would be Brenda at Ritz Camera, her understanding and immeadiate attention to my concern saved the day we have 2 new tripod a that are working excellent. With that being said please remember that this is a starter kit and the manufacturing is good but I do not know if we will get a whole lot of longevity out of it. But I di believe with good care like son # 2 it will last at least 3+ years or until he is ready for an upgrade, with his own money this time, as for son # 1 he already cross threaded his zoom lens and we need to purchase a tool that will unthread it. Son # 2 helped him the first time but he did it again and flipped the lense. Brenda was so helpful I will contact her about purchasing a tool to help us fix this. My faith in purchasing a big ticket item on Amazon from a quality company like Ritz is rock solid and I would not hesitate to buy another,\nMaybe for myself who knows,\nOnce again thank you Mary at Amazon and thank you, thank you Brenda at Ritz Camera, you guys are what customer service should always be like."},{"reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Four Stars","reviewDate":"March 6, 2017","reviewText":"All equipment was new and well packaged.

Shouldn't this be a standard feature?","reviewDate":"January 23, 2018","reviewText":"While this is a great introductory camera and kit in many ways, unfortunately there was no 3.5mm mic input on the camera. This was not clearly listed--which I get to some degree, as most products list what they have, not what they don't have. But a 3.5mm mic input on a camera with video recording capabilities seems like a steering wheel on a car--it isn't a feature, it's a necessity. This isn't Ritz's problem, as Canon does the same thing by not listing it on their info. But it certainly seems less than honest for anyone who lists this camera not to mention.\n\nUnfortunately, we were taking the camera with us as a gift for a mission to homeless kids in Africa so they could make videos and grow their support base. We didn't discover this until after we arrived in Africa, so we couldn't take it back and exchange it as we don't have people coming back and forth regularly, so this choice to not list something that is a necessity for us to produce good videos will directly affect our ability to reach out to kids who live on the streets.\n\nOther than that, it seems to be a decent starter camera. But if you do any videos at all, go a different direction."},{"reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Definitely a good buy","reviewDate":"January 12, 2017","reviewText":"Love my Canon camera, have been learning how to take better pictures every day."},{"reviewerName":"Robert Wewer","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Battery Problem","reviewDate":"July 28, 2017","reviewText":"I have a (known) problem with the battery - rapid blink on charge"},{"reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"This camera is amazing and worth every dime","reviewDate":"February 23, 2017","reviewText":"This camera is amazing and worth every dime.

I would just recommend to buy another strap and case - I would suggest the backpacks (both will give you more comfort on daily use).

I ordered the Canon Rebel T6 camera kit through RitzCamera because I thought their customer service would be great if I had any problems. I was so wrong! I was pleased with the camera and all of the accessories that came in the kit. I used the camera for a couple of days, but once I was able to download my photos, I noticed a black spot on all of the photos. I did some research and believe it is something on (or damage to) the sensor. I contacted Amazon and the only option I was given was to return everything. Other than the black spot, I like the camera and did not want to return it, but no option was given to exchange it for a camera without a defect. That same day I received an email from RitzCamera asking if I was satisfied with my order and \"If, for any reason, you aren't completely satisfied, please reply to this email so that we may address your concerns before you leave a product review. We would love to hear from you and are committed to your total satisfaction\". I responded to the email explaining the problem with the camera, asking what they would do to make it right. Here is the response I received: \"When it comes to Amazon fulfilled orders we are very limited on what we are able to do as you must go to Amazon directly for larger matters.\" To me, that means: \"Too bad, how sad, you're out of luck, we're not going to help you with the defective $600 camera we sent you.\" So much for being \"committed to your total satisfaction\"!

Other customers have said these extra lenses don't fit, but they do.\n\nI have used all of the lenses a little, and love them. I am still learning how everything works, but so far I do love the camera and have taken almost 200 pictures. We recently took a trip to the Carolinas, and I took pictures of the sky, deer, birds, landscapes and animals in a small zoo. I took a few pictures from a moving vehicle, most of them came out clear, but a couple came out a little blurry - one from going around a corner, the other I don't remember why.\n\nI would recommend this bundle and from this seller. I remember Ritz Camera stores from my childhood, so the name stuck in my mind. I am glad that I ordered from this company.\n\nIn addition, when I thought that the lenses didn't fit, I wrote the company and asked if I could exchange the product. They opened a ticket and responded within a couple of hours. Then after further research, I discovered that the lenses are threaded to fit on to the end of the Canon lenses and wrote them back saying that I no longer needed to exchange them, the ticket could be closed.\n\nAlthough there was no transaction, the fact that their customer service department responded so quickly also impressed me\n\nI do wish that I had photos to share. There isn't a CD to install the software for loading pictures on to the computer, that has to be downloaded from the website and I have yet to do that."},{"reviewerName":"Kylee Woods","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"This camera is the perfect camera for someone who wants to pursue a small ...","reviewDate":"January 31, 2018","reviewText":"This camera is the perfect camera for someone who wants to pursue a small photography career. I got this camera a little over a year ago, use it many times a week, and I am satisfied every time I use it. It comes with many great accessories. It takes fantastic pictures. I ordered this camera because I was looking for a hobby and I knew that I enjoyed taking pictures. I searched for many different cameras but I will never regret the choice of this Canon EOS Rebel.\n\nThis camera has many accessories that can be used when taking pictures. It takes great pictures of sports, the outdoors, portraits, and more. This entire kit comes with lens that zoom out a great amount and lens that can take away glare! As much as I use this camera, I was happy to receive two batteries with the camera! This is a great way for one battery to charge while one is being used. All of the necessities are valuable and easy to use.\n\nThe camera itself has many different settings and options! The camera has a timer setting where you can set and walk away to position for a picture. It also has many different options such as; sports, manual, portrait, night, etc. The lenses are great as they have different ones to make pictures HD, take away glare, etc. This camera takes amazing pictures of just about anything. The camera is easy to maneuver and quick to figure out. Another great thing about this camera, is the SD card holds so much storage and allows many pictures to be held within the camera.\n\nThis camera is perfect for photographers or people who have a hobby in photography. Although this camera and kit is pricey, it is worth the amount paid. It includes many different things along with the camera.

Some of the extras in the kit are inexpensive throw-ins. I would have rather seen an extra battery or memory card. However I found the larger tripod easy to use, especially for closeup photography.

All Components are there BUT the lens kits are not Polaroid as advertised. Instead we got \"Xit\" brand for the 0.43x lens, 2.2x lens, digital ultraviolet lens and digital reader/writer. Included memory cards were not Lexar brand but Transcend. Included bag was not Canon but Vivitar. Almost every single item was not the brand name advertised. Not sure of the quality of these other items but did find a package online for less money with the Xit products, leading me to believe we didn't receive the quality we paid for."},{"reviewerName":"navy-n-scoutmom","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Best Christmas gift ever!","reviewDate":"December 25, 2018","reviewText":"We bought this set for our granddaughter for Christmas.

Scott","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Not Two Batteries","reviewDate":"May 2, 2018","reviewText":"The product and kit are awesome with one specific deficiency. The photo clearly leads one to believe they will get two batteries, and even in the product questions section some say they did in fact get two and others only one. So either the picture is wrong or the description and items shipped is."},{"reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Ritz Camera has always delivered as advertised.
