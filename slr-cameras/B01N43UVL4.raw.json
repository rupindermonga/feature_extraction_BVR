But everything in the set was there as promised, nothing damaged, and quick shipping. This was the best set on amazon for this camera in my opinion because the other ones come with a bunch of incompatible, cheap junk. This one gives you all the essentials, and good quality ones you can actually use!

I have never taken pictures so nice than with this camera. I had given up taking photographs because they always turned out blurry, but now, I'm back at it.\n\nThe package deal that we got with the camera was terrific, and the price was outstanding. It was a deal that we simply could not pass up. I would highly recommend this camera to everyone - beginners and pros alike. The seller was phenomenal. The camera shipped and was received within two days of payment in perfect condition. The packaging was not damaged in any way and the items were packaged such that there would be no damage should the outer package have been damaged. I would also purchase from this seller again."},{"reviewerName":"Breanna","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Worth it.","reviewDate":"October 22, 2018","reviewText":"I shopped around for a nice camera and finally came across this.
