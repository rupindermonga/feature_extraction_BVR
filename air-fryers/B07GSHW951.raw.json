I saw the Mockins on Amazon, was satisfied with the reviews and the price, and decided to go for it. The basket in this one is HUGE -- about 9 inches across and about 5 inches deep. Might not be big enough for a Thanksgiving turkey, but it will hold a LOT of food. Thankfully, the exterior doesn't seem any larger than other air fryers with a basket only a quarter the size of this one. The unit is nearly silent while operating and cleans beautifully. So far, I've only needed to wipe it out with a sponge. My first effort was very healthy chicken fillets (with just seasoning, no oil and no breading). Every morsel was enthusiastically eaten. The second effort was brats. Instead of my usual parboiling then grilling brats, I only air broiled them. They came out juicy and delicious. Next is going to be either shrimp or catfish and I can't wait to try out a few other foods that I've been avoiding because they needed to be breaded or fried. This is an excellent gift -- either for your own household or that of someone you love. Just do it."},{"reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Review","reviewDate":"October 28, 2018","reviewText":"I just purchased this product. I had a smaller air fryer that worked great so i think just getting used to this one is all i need to do. I used it twice and my food came out good. I think it worked better the second time.

Excellent quality and features","reviewDate":"October 22, 2019","reviewText":"We are pleased with the air fryer. It has a good sized capacity and cooks well. It does a great job on chicken and fish and works especially well for asparagus. We did note an odor when using the fryer for the first few times but it has since dissipated. A note concerning all air fryers. While it does work well, I find that many things that I cook in the air fryer could be just as easily, and often more easily, be cooked on a baking sheet in the oven. In my opinion, they are sort of a fad that will likely die out. Having said that, if you want to get one, this one has been a good one so far. We are happy with the quality and the features. there is a plastic cover over the basket release that prevents you from accidentally releasing the basket and having the basket and fryer bottom separate and spill hot food or the hot basket. I notices that some reviewers noted this was a problem on other fryers. I cannot recall if anyone noted having a problem with this one. I will say that if you have that problem with this one, you are probably mentally defective as the cover makes it nearly impossible to accidentally release the basket. We use the parchment inserts when cooking and this preserves the Teflon coating of the basket and cooker. I highly recommend that you buy these inserts. They make cleaning a breeze. I think it is also a good idea to buy an accessories kit to go with the fryer. People who report having problems with this are obviously not using these recommended inserts or are using harsh abrasive items to clean the fryer. Please note when purchasing an air fryer that there is a learning curve concerning how to cook foods perfectly in it. It takes some time to get to know how it works and cooks and one should not expect perfection immediately."},{"reviewerName":"James E.

Unfortunately, the price for its size and excellent reviews proved too good to be true. The air fryer is defective and unusable: The drawer does not fit correctly in the machine, so the fryer gets no electrical power unless I push down on and hold the drawer handle. If I let go, the power shuts off. Thus, I wasn't even able to try the fryer. I contacted Amazon and its customer service walked me through a number of troubleshooting steps before acknowledging that the product was simply defective. A frustrating, dinner-less night, and now I have to box it up and send it back. Amazon's customer service was excellent, but I will be using my refund on a different brand instead of risking the same thing happening again."},{"reviewerName":"c wyman","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Honored the warranty as stated on the Amazon site.","reviewDate":"March 15, 2019","reviewText":"The inter basket lock/unlock button malfunctioned making it possible for the inner basket to come out when shaken.

I used it twice and was in love with this fryer. It was really easy to use and the food turned out great. The third and fourth time i tried to use, I started to have issues. The temp wouldn't let me set for more than 200 ( I reset several times). I decided to cook what was planned at 200 and double the time and then it started to trip my breaker. The next day I called Mockens and they were quick and awesome with my frustraion. They belieaved that the fryer must not be compatable with my outlet. I belieave it was a fluke and my fryer was defective (since it stopped going pass 200). They said they never ran into this issue and didn't want to send me another one since it was tripping my breaker. They refunded me my money quickly and didn't make me send it back. I'm ordering another brand and wattage to see if I have better luck.

I think the picture doesn‚Äôt do any justice to the size because this thing is huge and I probably could‚Äôve gotten a smaller version but I have more room for more food so I‚Äôm not complaining. It cooks everything is record fast time and always has a crispy crunch that‚Äôs unmatched. Before I would always reheat things like fried chicken or catfish in the oven and the texture would remain the same as if it came out of the fridge (slightly soft), but now I get a better crunch than when I originally brought them home. Just amazing. Only thing I would say to watch out for are the preset times, because (especially when reheating) most items don‚Äôt need the full amount of time to get hot and crispy. One of the first times I used it, I left catfish nuggets in for the preset time for fish and those things were hard as a rock!"},{"reviewerName":"Glenn Allen","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"So Far, So Good","reviewDate":"October 2, 2018","reviewText":"Used one time so far, frying chicken thighs with good results.

Yes much better for being healthy here.\nI have yet to try some of their recipes in the booklet provided. I highly recommend this great machine."},{"reviewerName":"K. Romer","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great Machine at a Budget Price","reviewDate":"May 29, 2019","reviewText":"So far I have been very happy with this air fryer. It does a great job and quickly. I did give it 4 stars due to the fact that the non-stick coating started coming off pretty quickly. Personally that doesn't bother me too much, as I usually coat my food with oil or butter before air frying. I am also careful to not just hold the handle when I am shaking up the food, but support the basket with a heat protected hand, so as not to put too much strain on the basket handle connection. I do give 5 stars to the customer service, as they rapidly responded to an issue I had. When I received the item, the flip cover over the release button was broken (probably happened in shipping). Amazon wanted me to ship the entire fyer back and they would send me a new complete unit. I didn't want to go through all this hassle for such a small piece that was not mandatory for use of the item. I contacted the manufacturer and they sent me a replacement PDQ at no charge.\nI have been using this regularly to make crispy, delicious meals. Tonight I'm making tuna melts using this item and won't be heating up my entire kitchen here in Texas."},{"reviewerName":"Stephen O Hopkins","rating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Fragile item & Mockins doesn't answer phone and no voicemail","reviewDate":"June 18, 2019","reviewText":"Less than a week and the small plastic clip that covers the handle release button has already broken. Fryer should have came with a bag of replacement clips because they will not hold up. They did send a small bag (qty 2) of replacement rubber covers for bolt heads that support the bottom of the basket. I guess they knew they would fall off half the time you washed it. It does make good chicken though. Still trying to figure out veggies, been burning most but I need to learn to cook them. Haven't had much luck figuring veggies in an air fryer out. Info is sparse.\nEvery time I see the broken and now set aside handle clip It will rub me the wrong way. Might send it back.\nMockins messaged me and offered to send me a replacement clip and gave me a Boston MA phone number claim my replacement. Was working odd hours and called a week or 2 later.

Just make sure to take off the rubber pieces covering the bolts in the basket. The rubber pieces come off super easy when cleaning and I have lost one due to forgetting to take them off while washing.\nOther than that, the air fryer does what you want. I have cooked whole chickens, chicken tenders, chicken breasts, pork chops, lots of frozen items, anything that can be baked can be air fried and tastes just as good, if not better.\nThis air fryer does stop at 400 degrees, but most do this. The size of the basket allows for whole chickens (6lbs is what I used) plus lots of other items. Make sure to preheat, which only takes a couple minutes. So if I'm cooking something for 8 mins, I set timer for 10 to preheat. You do have to shake the basket or turn things like any fryer."},{"reviewerName":"Michael White","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Loving our first air fryer!","reviewDate":"June 19, 2019","reviewText":"Never owned an air fryer before.
