Since then we've used it nearly everyday.\n\n*** Updated 4/23/17 ***\n\nWhat I like:\n- Easy to Use - There are multiple presets to help cook steaks, fish, chicken, and more. Or you can manually set the temperature from 180 degrees up to 400 degrees and set the amount of time you need from 1 to 59 minutes.\n- Accessories - It comes with a divider so you can cook two separate foods at once. It also comes with a baking pan, which you can use for cornbread or cakes.\n- Easy to Clean - The basket cleans easily, but is best to clean it right after you use it and by hand with warm soapy water. Do not put in dishwasher, even though it says you can. Trust me, it'll last far longer.\n- Frozen Foods - From my experience this is one area where it really shines. Instead of limp or soggy reheated frozen foods from the microwave, the Air Fryer can reheat just about anything I've thrown at it from frozen fish fillets to onion rings or corn dogs, and everything is crispy or crunchy as if fried in oil, but it's not, which makes it so much healthier.\n- Cooking Meats - This is the other area where this fryer excels. Hot dogs with blackened skins as if cooked over an open flame, and in only 4-5 minutes at 380. Steaks, pork chops, wings, chicken breasts, and even whole chickens turn out amazing and so much faster than baking in the oven or on the grill.\n- Fresh Veggies - These take some practice and experimenting, but baked potatoes, sweet potatoes, asparagus, poblano peppers, all quickly cooked without having to heat up your kitchen.\n\nWhat I don't like:\n- Vents very hot air out the back, which I'd forgotten, and one night noticed one of my blinds was drooping and quickly realized it was because I had the fryer too close to the wall. I was able to bend the blind back into shape, well mostly straight anyways. LOL! Now I just make sure I pull the fryer out to the edge of the counter and have had no issues since.\n- So So on Freshly Breaded Foods - Yes you can spritz freshly breaded items with oil, or spray with cooking spray, but I find that it's more trouble than it's worth and a lot more messy. So I'll do a quick flash fry in oil, then finish off the frying in the Air Fryer, which tends to remove much of the excess oil that may be on the fried food.\n\nTips/Tricks:\n- Experiment - The manual provides a few basic foods and suggested cooking temps and times, but there is many more foods that you just have to experiment with. However, check out the Power AirFryer XL Facebook page and Amazon for AirFrying cookbooks.\n- Buy high temp silicone trivets. This will help you not ding up the black bottom basket with the copper fry basket, especially with heavier foods like steak, chicken, etc. Walmart sells a Rachel Ray Trivet set for around $5, which goes beneath the copper fry basket and works perfectly!\n- When Hot, Insert the Basket in a Scooping Motion. Some have reported that the basket seems to get stuck when trying to insert it into the machine, especially when hot. It even happened to me a few times, until I came across this tip. If you use a scooping motion, front end in first, the basket slides right in with no issue or resistance.\n- Leave the silicone tips on the divider. The silicone tips are high temp and are designed to keep the divider in place. They don't tell you that in the manual.\n- Line the bottom of the black basket with tinfoil if cooking very greasy foods for an easier cleanup.\n- Cover foods with tinfoil once at your desired crispiness, to help prevent them from burning, like chicken.\n- Preheat your AirFryer - Do this by turning it on at 400 for 2 minutes.\n\nFoods I've Made since Christmas:\n- Frozen Onion Rings - 400 for 8 minutes (flip the rings over after 5 minutes). They turned out so crispy and delicious, and with no oil!\n- Frozen Egg Rolls - 400 for 12 minutes (flip over half way through cooking).\n- Frozen Pizza Rolls - 400 for 4 minutes.\n- Frozen Mini Corn Dog Nuggets - 400 for 5 minutes.\n- Hot Dogs - 380 for 4-5 minutes depending on personal doneness, rolling over half way.\n- Whole Chicken (6lbs) - I just cooked this last night, and OMH!!! I rinsed the whole chicken and patted dry and then rubbed with a tiny bit of oil and seasoned with Johnny's Seasoning Salt (Google it, you'll be glad you did!) and black pepper. Then place in AirFryer basket breast-side down and cook at 370 for 35 minutes. Then I flipped it over to breast-side up and cooked an additional 30 minutes. When I saw the skin was to my desired crispiness, I covered it with foil and cooked it for another 10 minutes, and then removed the foil and cooked another 5 minutes more. The result was the tastiest and juicy chicken! My kids actually wanted to eat the skin. Note: If the liquid comes up above the fry basket holes, then carefully dump out some of the juice and continue cooking. Also, you'll want to use the silicone trivets under the fry basket to keep it from making contact with the bottom basket.\n\nI hope this helps you make up your decision to buy the Power AirFryer XL, and I highly recommend the 5.3qt version. It really is perfect for any sized family!"},{"reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"BEWARE OF FIRE HAZARD!!","reviewDate":"October 6, 2017","reviewText":"My husband bought me this Air Fryer for mother's day this year and I absolutely loved it. I used it all the time and even told friends and family about it and encouraged them to purchase one.... Then, two nights ago, it came on by itself in the middle of the night while we were sleeping and got so hot that it melted the plastic on the back of the unit by the vent. We were lucky in that it set off the smoke detectors in the house and we were able to remove the basket and unplug it before it caught anything on fire!! If you are going to buy this product (or already have it), I would highly recommend that you UNPLUG it when not in use and keep it in an area away from anything else that is flammable when in use. I am planning to buy another air fryer, but will definitely look for a brand that at least carries a warranty for more than 60 days!!"},{"reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Would not recommend this product","reviewDate":"January 31, 2018","reviewText":"Would not recommend this product.

As some reviewers mentioned, \"air frying\" some items requires that you first pre-blanch or pre-cook, which is way too complicated. Also, the 5.3 quart model is HUGE; if I wasn't returning the item, I would have had to store it in my basement."},{"reviewerName":"F Fran","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"but super impressed with the result of making fries and wings","reviewDate":"January 5, 2018","reviewText":"Have only used a few times since the air fryer arrived last week, but super impressed with the result of making fries and wings, especially the wings!!!! Tried the \"fried chicken' recipe using chicken thighs. Based on the recipe it was extremely salty (will modify next time!) but the result was good. The wings were a WOW! Only negative so far is a strong chemical smell once in full gear of air frying, I have to assume this will disappear after a few more uses, the heating element is an electric coil therefore I assume this is the reason. Any comments or feedback welcome on this strong chemical smell coming from the back vent (I keep checking to see if somehow we missed the removal of some packing material that could cause this, but not finding anything)"},{"reviewerName":"THERESA I.","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Didn’t do enough homework prior to purchasing","reviewDate":"April 15, 2018","reviewText":"We were excited at first to use a product that would make certain dishes healthier, was able to get beyond the inconvenience of the size & weight of it however after approximately 9 months use (1-2 times a month) the drawer issue mentioned in earlier reviews has plagued our unit as well.

Generally; I can cut the bake time on a package in half with this Air Fryer. You can brown items nicely. It cleans out very easily and if you spray with a little olive oil to start, it will not stick to the pan. This fryer has a strong air movement inside that keeps things cooking more even.

It is very simple to use however, not all things cook perfectly.\n\nSo far I have used this to cook frozen jalapeno poppers, frozen pizza rolls, frozen Arby fries, frozen mozzarella sticks and frozen chicken fingers.\n\nFor things that are stuffed, like the pizza rolls, jalapeno poppers, or mozzarella sticks, it works wonderfully. Set it to 360° and out pops perfectly cooked food in under 10 minutes, including warm-up time.\n\nThe fries and chicken fingers cook much different. A single, lightly filled basket will produce food cooked in 3 ways; overcooked, perfectly cooked, and undercooked. I don't fill the basket up, in fact I barely have items overlapping but it still cooks uneven with these items. I've even tried shaking the basket halfway through cooking, but still end up with a similar result. I haven't quite figured out the trick with these items yet. The manual it comes with says to cook these items at 400°, but maybe I should bring it down to 360° as that temperature seems to cook my other food items perfectly. I will update as we try new items in our air fryer.\n\nI will say this: clean up is as simple as wiping it out and it DOES cut down on cook time. The pizza rolls typically take 15 mins to cook in our oven and the oven takes another 10 to 15 mins to preheat, so roughly 30 mins altogether, but the airfryer cooks them in a third of the time. From start to stop is ten minutes! Two minutes to heat up and 8 minutes to cook!"},{"reviewerName":"Customer","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Broke after 3 uses","reviewDate":"April 8, 2019","reviewText":"Broke after 3 uses"},{"reviewerName":"Rene Warren","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Wow, so glad I bought this!","reviewDate":"January 16, 2019","reviewText":"My oven doesn't work right anymore, it doesn't regulate temperature.

One thing to note. You need to open it up every once and a while and move items around so that they get evenly cooked. Also, you will have to work on the time and temp of cooking as it's different than a traditional oven. It can make for dry crispy fries in a hurry.

The first unit non stick bottom of the grease pan began peeling off after a month. After each use, more of the non-stick would peel off. So much for using drippings for anything other than landfill. After contacting the manufacturer, they informed me that after 59 days the unit was out their 30 day warranty and that they don't provide parts, only entire units. BUT lucky me, they would happily replace the unit for a DISCOUNTED price of only $39.00 plus shipping AND require that I pay to ship the original unit back. I declined and instead went back to Amazon. They did the right thing and replaced the unit and provided me with a return shipping label to ship the original unit back to them. The NEW unit smokes so bad when cooking chicken that it has to be placed outdoors to prevent it from setting off smoke alarms. It leaks oil and drippings from the back air vent of the unit and somehow drippings end up underneath the drip pan (which has like 6 six inches deep..\n\nWhile I LOVE the concept of the AirFryer, I just have to believe that there are higher quality products made by a manufacturer that believes in their product enough to provide a warranty longer than 30 days."},{"reviewerName":"Charlie","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Broken out of box","reviewDate":"February 18, 2019","reviewText":"I received it, plugged it in and the only thing it would display was E1, I consulted the manual which referred me to the manufacture who told me to call Amazon to get a replacement, called Amazon and they said they are out of stock and at best could give me a refund.

I didn't believe it but they really do make the best fries.\nI own many small kitchen appliances but I have to say, this is my favorite. Here's why:\n1) It cooks fast. It is a huge time saver for me. If you're a busy mom or just a busy individual, you will appreciate being able to reduce your cooking time. It has cut my cooking time in half.\n2) It keeps the mess inside the device. Meaning, my kitchen stove stays clean. The device is easier to clean. You soak it in soapy water for awhile and you wash it with a sponge. No oil splatters on my stove anymore!\n3) It cooks things to perfection without much attention. You just need to shake the thing once or twice and that's it.\n4) It turns off on its own so no need to worry about burning things. A mom/dad who is always being distracted by her kids will understand what I'm talking about.\n5) It cuts down on my use of oil. Whenever I fried food, it came out super expensive because I used good oil. It was also a pain to get rid of the used oil. With the air fryer, I've cut down on the amount of oil and hence the cost and I don't have to worry about disposing oil afterwards.\n6) It cooks enough for a big family. People worry about not being able to cook enough for a big family because of its size but the beauty of this product is that the ingredients can be overlapping in the fryer. They still cook perfectly. All you need to do is shake it before they are done. And because it cooks faster, you're still saving time even if you have to cook 2 batches.\nIt took me 5 tries to get the perfect my Japanese Chicken Karaage (fried chicken) recipe but I can now make them without using all that oil! I also made a Japanese style cheesecake and it came out better than the oven.\nAfter awhile, the basket loses its non stick quality so you need to grease it beforehand but even then, this kitchen gadget is the best thing I've ever bought.

So a taquito ends up being just a taquito without leaving a puddle of grease on your plate. Likewise, a piece of salmon comes out juicy with a light sear versus shiny and glistening (i.e. oily).\n\nAccordingly, the air fryer eliminates the odor associated with pan frying food. Instead, you notice an aroma of food being cooked versus being immersed and smothered.\n\nFinally, clean up is simple.

If I put 3\" of water into the black holder for soaking the basket after a cooking job, water streams out of the bottom of the black holder.

During the first cook the unit needed to be opened in order to flip the french fries. Unfortunately once the drawer reached cooking temperature and was removed it would no longer seat properly. Some reviewers suggest accidentally separating the basket but there is a plastic button guard in place for those with wandering thumbs. I have a friend with a working unit who is not experiencing this particular issue. Quite a few videos show this air fryer to be the cat's meow. I'm saddened mine didn't work out."},{"reviewerName":"Mike","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"AMAZING","reviewDate":"August 14, 2019","reviewText":"This product was a LIFE CHANGER!!

I make a crap ton of chicken strips, freeze them and then use them for my lunches during the week. It has cut down on my prep time by HOURS.

Well, I could not be more pleased with an appliance. This Air Fryer delivers all that it said it would and more. I had thought I would just make fried chicken for my husband ( it's his favorite) or occasionally make french fries. Instead, this appliance has won a permanent place on my counter top because I use it on a daily basis. I have made steaks, fried chicken, grilled chicken, whole roasted chicken, pork chops, salmon patties as well as the best french fries ever. I do occasionally have to adjust the bucket to go in and out, but if you pay attention to how it is lined up, this isn't a problem. Also, if you want to do large quantities of food, this isn't the appliance you need. But if you are cooking for two, this appliance is great and really gets the job done. Clean up is really easy and best of all, we enjoy our \"fried\" food without all the mess and splatter and additional calories."},{"reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Other than that I really like it.

I love fried food, but refuse to eat it because of the added fat from oil and I don't like the mess in my kitchen. The Power Air Fryer XL allows me to eat all of the 'fried' food I want without the fat or mess. In addition to being able to enjoy food that is traditionally fried, I also use the Air Fryer for many of the things I would normally cook in the oven. Most of the frozen food products that recommend oven cooking, I now cook in my Air Fryer and the texture is so much better than the texture in the oven. The bonus is that the cook time is about half of the recommended oven time and there is no preheating. This means that I am also saving a lot of money on electricity. I generally cook everything on the default setting of 370 degrees and reduce the time significantly from the preset 15 minutes. Most items, I start on 4 - 7 minutes, then turn them over and cook them for another 4 - 7 minutes. That doesn't work for everything, but with practice, anyone can find the ideal settings for the foods they cook most often. The Power Air Fryer XL is my new favorite kitchen appliance!"},{"reviewerName":"Sunprincess","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"One Star","reviewDate":"January 8, 2018","reviewText":"Not as expected to work and cook.

Business 101 FAIL!","reviewDate":"December 29, 2017","reviewText":"This would be a 5 star hands down. If their Customer Service wasn't so uncaring. I love my Air Fryer and I use it pretty much every day. I have a huge kitchen with double ovens but this thing has replaced everything but my crock pot. However my biggest problem is the chipping on the bottom of the grease basket. Its just unsightly I suppose and doesn't matter. It doesn't affect performance but I bought one for the inlaws, cheaper (because Power Air Fryer Customer service SUCKS!) and it hasn't done this so it makes you realize that there is a better way.\n\nCustomer service with this product is the problem. I've probably sold a few hundred of these things for them in my positive remarks about it to anyone who will listen. Cashiers in the grocery store, people in the meat aisle, friends, relatives, coworkers, people on the metro. I sing the praises of this thing. Well, I USED to. Sadly I'm going to just not give the brand now when I rave about how much I love it. I mean if the company wants to be a jerk....they could really have busted the market if they took time on customer service. Its sad. But not my problem. :/\n\nOverall the concept is wonderful. I can do a salmon steak in this thing better and faster than I've ever done on a frying pan or in the oven. I don't even use the microwave anymore. We heat up pizza in it. Make grilled cheese sandwiches...I mean its the bomb.

I bought this 5.3quart power air fryer XL over the thanks giving holiday and I was excited to give it a try.\nFirst of all, this looked cheap.. but you get what you pay for and I hope it will perform.\nI followed the instructions to the dot. Cleaned it well and all that. Tried to make a batch of fries and whole kitchen smelled like burning plastic. (To the point I was getting headaches. ) After 15-20 mins flies came out fairly decent however, they tasted like plastic as well. I read somewhere in Power Air Fryer Facebook page, people having the same issue and some customer support guy said if the plastic smell is there after about 5th use, contact them for further assistance. I used this more than 5 times thinking the taste would go away because I really wanted to like this product. I had no luck what so ever and tried making different food such as chicken fingers but ended up throwing everything away.\n\nI ended up returning this and bought a Ninja Air Fryer for about $30 more and it is a night and day difference. We absolutely love our Ninja products. I will write a separate review for Ninja Air Fryer.\n\nBottom line is, invest few bucks more and get a Philips or Ninja or any other good brand.

Purchase another brand.\n\nI believe the copper lining of the fry basket of my AirFryer XL is defective. After a few months of use the copper lining is peeling off the interior cook surface. I have only used silicon utensils in it and washed it only with soap and a sponge. I have other copper cookware and all of that is fine.It's only the fry basket that has a problem.\n\nI contacted customer service and was disappointed in the level of service I received. The online person suggested I exposed it to cold temperatures. The telephone support person suggested I put the tray into the fryer incorrectly. I assure you I did neither of those things, nor should either of those cause the interior cooking surface to peel.\n\nI continued and spoke to a supervisor who told me there is no free replacement of the basket available after 60 days. I am expected to purchase a new fry basket for about $25. I truly believe the product is defective and am surprised the company will not warranty products beyond two months. \n\nInstead of spending $25 to replace a product that the company won't stand behind, I will purchase another brand. I suggest you do the same as well. It is my hope that my experiences with this company will save someone else from suffering the same fate. \n\nExpecting a company to stand behind its product for more than 60 days is not too much to ask. If they have no faith in their product then neither do I. It would have cost them very little to replace this fry basket. In today's consumer driven age I find it hard to believe for that small cost they are willing to lose customers."},{"reviewerName":"Kathy Johnson","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Three Stars","reviewDate":"January 9, 2017","reviewText":"Made great Christmas gifts.

The most irritating thing is that it’s made of such cheap plastic and it gets so hot that it’s beginning to fall apart a year later. The entire front plate of the basket fell off because the screws that hold it on are also made of plastic. Like a dummy I bought the extended warranty and contacted them regrading this issue but they said that this is a Cosmetic Issue! We looked into the warranty and it really doesn’t cover anything unless the motor takes a dump. And the you have to pay to ship it to them and for the return postage back to you! WHAT!

And they say you don't have to. However, upon first use, it emitted the most noxious fumes and the smell and taste permeated the air and the food tasted like poison. It was not edible. However, upon second use before I was about to return the unit as advised by Power AirFryer reps, the bad fumes were not present any longer and the food was edible. In fact, the food does crisp and cook fantastic.\n\nAnd now, what brings me here, is the inner non-stick coating has started to peel. I don't care how safe the company claims that coating is. I don't want to have it in my food. I called Power AirFryer, and their answer was: don't subject it to cool temperatures right away after cooking or it will peel. Seriously????? They didn't even offer to send me a new nonstick basket as a courtesy. I'm not sure I'd want to ever deal with their products again. This unit has been cared for very gently too, and never subjected to temperature changes as they suggested nor has it been washed in a dishwasher ever. So, their lack of customer care has turned me off.\n\nJust beware: The interior black non-stick coating will at some point start to deteriorate. Would you want to eat it? I don't.

The first time, we cooked chicken drumsticks that were tasty and had a nice crispness to them. They cooked much faster than on the BBQ grill. You had to turn them in the Air Fryer after a short time, and the darn drawer just wouldn't fit in right to trigger the display to work and the air frying to commence. Finally got it to accept it. Grrr...\nThe second time we used it was for potato wedges and fish. The potato wedges needed longer to cook, so we took out the drawer later to add in the fish. Wouldn't close properly. Much aggravation and slamming of the drawer in to try to get it to sit right and connect to the sensors. The potato wedges turned out good and the fish had a nice crispiness to the coating.\nOur fryer came with an oil spray bottle but that had a crack in it. I won't bother with trying to get that replaced, as we are going to return the whole machine.\nAlso, the machine is huge and tall, so it won't fit in any of our cupboards or the pantry. It takes up more room than our toaster oven."},{"reviewerName":"James Papeika","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"8 months is not enough for an appliance","reviewDate":"August 3, 2019","reviewText":"First, let me say that we were very happy with this air fryer, which we purchased at Kohl’s (with one of their coupons) in late November 2018. This was our first attempt with an air fryer, and we (kids too) were very happy with the results.\n\nCooking with the air fryer was quicker than heating up the oven and, after some trial and error with time and temperature, resulted in good, crispy fries, chicken, bacon (which is a mess), etc. French fries were closer to actually deep-fry than the oven and maybe 10 minutes quicker.\n\nI must, however, offer only one star. On August 1, 2019, the fryer died with about 8 minutes left on the timer. So, this appliance served us 1-3 times per week for only 8 months. I believe this product is inferior and comes with an insufficient warranty of only 60 days.\n\nBy the way, I pulled out the instructions. If you do qualify for warranty service, they expect you to pay for the shipping back to them (which would cost some money, the box is large and weighs a few pounds). I have obtained warranty service for Apple products, Bose, Samsung, Nintendo, etc. (I save every instruction book and receipt), and respectable manufacturers always send an email linking to a UPS/FedEx shipping label.\n\nIt’s bad enough that you need to pay to ship their inferior product back to them—when you do, they expect you to include a check or money order for $19.99 payable to Tristar products. So, you will send them $20 and pay $25 or more for shipping and packing materials. This is a faux warranty, with enough obstacles (a very limited time frame and cost) to make any warranty claim not worth your trouble.\n\nTo summarize, I do recommend trying an air fryer, but I would suggest caution with this brand.\n\nI doubt anyone from Amazon will ever read this, but I have a suggestion: reviews should be better aggregated for each manufacturer/supplier, not each individual product. One manufacturer can have several different, but similar models (and, often, even slightly different model numbers for the same product sold to different suppliers), and a review like mine could be easily missed by an Amazon shopper who would benefit from this information."},{"reviewerName":"M.

First unit cooked two small food items nicely. Upon third food, french fries, the unit cooked for 10 minutes then after the manual shake procedure upon reinsertionof the basket the unit went dead. Zip. Zero. After all night 'cool off' as recommended by the instructions (such as they were) the unit still did not come on. We tried a different house circuit to no use. So returned unit to purchase point and swapped for second unit. Can we say double epic fail? Same deal only on first use! Called company. Talked to a nice H1B teleworker from the far East operating from NE Kansas. He was clueless on the problem, but launched into a memorized speech on buying their $300 air oven that had 7 different attachments and would replace all my kitchen appliances. I tried logic on him asking why I would buy another high priced item from a company that could make the first item work as advertised? Turn page on script, pause and then went into back-up mantra. I did discover what was failing but will let the company figure it out when they get their next boxcar load of rejects from retail outlets. Bottom line: JUNK.

I've made a variety of things with it so far and while there is a bit of a learning curve (I've overcooked some stuff with it so far), once you get the hang of it, the food is AMAZING!!!\n\nI've never owned a regular fryer, don't buy tater tots or French fries, etc. (not judging if you do - this is purely mentioned to share my experience level with frying things) and I could not believe that I could get things crispy as if they were fried, only doing it with hot air! Especially when you consider air popped popcorn is not really as enjoyable as traditional popcorn since it's so dry and 'cardboardy' (ok, I'm sure there are a few who would disagree).\n\nMy two favorite things that I've made in the air fryer so far are wings and hamburgers. I buy fresh wings in the meat department (frozen aren't even close to the same), toss them ever so slightly in olive oil and grind some fresh pepper and sea salt on them and then put them in the basket on the French fry setting for 25 minutes. You pull out the basket about half way and shake them around a bit to make sure they get evenly cooked... The outsides got nice and lightly browned and crispy on the outside and the meat was fully cooked inside and tender. My family even felt like the wings were restaurant quality! I tossed a few in sauces but they preferred them plain because they tasted so good!\n\nThe burgers were amazing also! I put a tiny bit of water in the bottom of the pan to start with to kind of 'steam' the burgers. I formed my patties and seasoned them like I like then put them in at 330 degrees for 10 minutes. I know people like them cooked at different temperatures but that's what worked for us. You can add cheese but it's an Air Fryer (blowing hot air at high speeds) and will blow the cheese right off mostly... It's a pain to clean up! Just sayin'... The burgers were insanely juicy, flavorful and the grease drips down into the pan below.\n\nMy kids like to be self-sufficient and so I buy individual frozen chicken breasts stuffed with asparagus and cheese. Typically you have to preheat the oven (10+ minutes) and then bake for 30 minutes. Now they can cook one of these in the Air Fryer for 12 minutes (no preheat) and it comes out fully cooked, crisped on the outside, and my kids swear it tastes better!\n\nAgain, be prepared for the learning curve when you get one because it really does take a little getting used to when you start to figure out how long it takes to cook things. Once you start using it though, you won't go back! I hate to deduct a start but I don't think an appliance this expensive should start losing it's coating after one month of use."},{"reviewerName":"Mark","rating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Haven’t been impressed so far","reviewDate":"December 7, 2017","reviewText":"Have not been impressed with this so far. Maybe I need to give it another chance. Tried to make a combo of frozen fish filets and breaded shrimp in one half of the basket and fries in the other. The fish nested together and when attempt was made to rearrange they fell apart. Spent double the time using this instead of just using the oven. Food was not evenly cooked despite all the shenanigans. The preset menu choices don’t work that well and you need to refer to the manual and attempt to determine a good cooking time and temperature. Like others I found the basket difficult to reinsert during cooking. It’s helpful to push down slightly on the handle, instead of your instinct which is to pull upwards. I think this will end up in the back of the pantry and seldom used, like a bread maker."},{"reviewerName":"Kyle Daniels","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Works great for FROZEN chicken wings too!","reviewDate":"November 12, 2018","reviewText":"I love chicken wings and wanted to try and save some money by buying ones that I can cook at home and use all of the many sauces I have. I imagine that fresh chicken wings would probably taste the best however I bought a $10 bag of store branded frozen chicken wings and made 2 batches in the first 2 days of owning this thing and they both came out excellent! I did not have to thaw them out even, just threw them right in.\n\nThe key to this unit will be monitoring the cooking and learning what is the best temperatures for cooking things at as I did 2 separate lengths of time with my 2 batches of wings and one was crispier than the other was. Also in the instruction book it mentions you can preheat the unit by turning it on for 2-3 minutes and let it warm up. I don't know if that is truly necessary or not, but I did it both times, so some attempts without a preheat will confirm if it really is needed or not, since it seems to heat up pretty fast. I used the french fry button and that actually overcooked a set of frozen curly fries even when i knocked 5 minutes off the time out of worrying, and glad I did or they would have ended up black! So I am not sure how well the preset buttons work and what size portions they are accounting for.\n\nOne issue I did notice is that I cannot seem to get the timer/ding to work on this thing. Apparently if you use the preset buttons it is supposed to ding every 5 minutes to remind you to shake the basked contents around but I could not get that to turn on so I just used the microwave timer to remind me.\n\nAs I use this more (mainly on wings) I will hopefully learn to perfect the timing and preheating issues so that it comes out better and better. But this is a neat unit that we hope to get a lot of use out of! BTW we are using the 5.3 Qt version which is actually quite large in size with the limited counter space that we have."},{"reviewerName":"Christopher T Grant","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Customer service from power air fryer is terrible","reviewDate":"April 11, 2019","reviewText":"I purchased this on Thanksgiving night 2018.

If at least the inside basket were made of steel, then it would be \"winner, winner-use it to cook dinner\". The warranty is a modest 90 days. While we love the product and how it cooks, the basket thing is a deal-breaker. We are going to get another brand, unfortunately smaller, but with a stainless steel basket.

I never fried before I bought this I just wanted something that would make my food more crispy and this did the trick. Also I have used this to re heat leftovers and I’m thrilled with the results food is exactly how I want it to come out.\nSome issues I have found is If I don’t eat the potatoes for example within 30 minutes they get soggy some of the food if I don’t watch it gets to dry. I blame myself more than the machine. Because it has a timer on it I now set that for less time when it beeps I check the food shake it and then do my second round instead of setting the timer and checking the food half way through.\nBecause they have newer models now I probably would chose the oven type over this style.

Many foods come out pretty good; close to deep fay frying. Chicken wings for example, that have fat in the skins do well. Other things might benefit from a spray of some sort of oil.\nIt is pretty fast, and could save time, but almost everything must be turned over mid way.\nThe 'large' one is the only one to get unless you're cooking for one.\nBut I could not recommend this model. Closing the cooker is difficult when it is cold, and becomes much more difficult when it is warm/hot. A half dozen to dozen attempts trying to get the basket close properly is not only frustrating, but the food items you had spaced properly, are now in a heap on one side of the basket. This is going to effect uniform cooking. Once you do succeed in getting it to close, your joy will be tempered by the knowledge that in a few minutes you'll need to turn the food, and reinserting the basket will be at least as difficult as it was originally."},{"reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Done with oil frying","reviewDate":"September 16, 2018","reviewText":"After trying two other brands of air fryer's, one which was thrown in the trash after only 6 months of use and the heating element stopped working, the second the Comfee' brand in which in order to use it I had to unscrew and screw in two screws to hold the basket in (horrible design), I opted for the Power Air Fryer XL 5.3qt.\nThe first thing I was impressed at was how silent it operated.

First off do not cook the food as long as the recipe states, it will burn. This was our first try so we were being careful to check on the food often. The preset guide for pork chops was 25 mins at 350. That is about 8 mins too long. It’s the same with French fries, we used waffle fries with the preset French Fry setting and that was also about 8 mins too long. I don’t think it is made very well and it is sometimes very hard to open and close (pulls out pretty good but it takes a little finagling to push back in). The housing iis made of plastic so when I was trying to push the drawer back in I was afraid of breaking it. It is not noisy or hard to learn.

The basket has clearly lost it's nonstick coating because everything sticks to it, and it is difficult to clean even though I thoroughly spray it with PAM before each use. When I contacted the company regarding these issues, they told me that they could not help me because I did not purchase the product from them directly.

I did not read any reviews before purchasing this, but I did have the same issue as most: the drawer is hard to get back in. I noticed it when initially putting it together, and especially when checking the food. Apparently, the secret to getting the tray in is to angle it slightly down until it is about an inch from where it should seal, then angle it back up at 180 degrees for that last inch or so when pushing forward. It should snap right in to place. It took a few times to get it, but once you get the hang of it, it's definitely worth it. I've made wings twice, and fries once.

We used it regularly to make Tyson frozen chicken and other frozen appetizer type items. It worked as intended and the food was very good. Sometimes the food being cooked gets a little too done around the edges but we've found that shaking the bowl every few minutes alleviates this issue. The frequency of the bowl shaking is an annoyance however. In the last month or so, after owning the air fryer for 6 months, the screen will flash and the fryer will suddenly turn itself off then back on again to resume cooking. This air fryer seems average, hence the average number of stars.

Once you start cooking something if you pull the tray to shake or check doneness partway through - you cant get the tray/basket back in. VERY FRUSTRATING!

Strip steak cooked to medium rare in the programmed time. It was juicy and tender, although the outside was not chard as you expect from a grill or broiler, still tasted great. Both the chicken breast and steak were cooked with sweet potato wedges (home made) which came out great (one time they were tossed in olive oil before cooking, the other time just sprayed with butter spray, both turned out fine.)\n\nFrozen raw chicken wings also came out great, whether tossed in olive oil or covered with butter spray. I thought the olive oil ones came out a bit crispier.\n\nThe bigger issue is that the plastic housing on the outer container pushes out in places when fit into the fryer, and for some reason it shuts off before the timed cooking time has been reached.\n\nI think the features are great - large 5.3 qt, dishwasher safe pans, food divider, etc, but the quality leaves much to be desired."},{"reviewerName":"Wanita","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Stinks","reviewDate":"August 17, 2019","reviewText":"I have one of these that is about a year old.

Spoke with a supervisor who was extremely rude and kept repeating over and over....while talking over me...that the warranty was being honored. I received a defective machine and I do not believe I should have to incur expenses to have a working unit. Customer service admitted that this the basket issue is a common problem.

Doesn’t close properly.","reviewDate":"December 26, 2017","reviewText":"Worked the first time. Cooked cheese sticks, but they were over done and dry. Used again to Cook French fries and could not get the basket drawer to close when I opened it up to shake the basket mid way into the frying process. The unit smelled like melting plastic and the basket would not easily close. Very poor design. The display will not light up until basket is fully shut. The heat makes the drawer warp to the point that it will not align properly. I am sending it back after one use.

Rhynard","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Air Fryers are amazing, but not this particular model","reviewDate":"January 4, 2017","reviewText":"Pros:\nLooks neat\nHeats up fast\nInexpensive\nCooks food fast\nAir is definitely the new oil, the concept would work if the unit was designed properly.\nEasy to clean\n\nCons:\nThe display and controls are not intuitive.\nCooks unevenly - the holes for air flow are too far apart.\nThe drawer has design issues: after heating, the drawer has difficulty being slid back into the unit.\nSpews much heat into the kitchen (good in winter, bad in summer)\nMotor occasionally makes grinding noise, sounds \"wrong\".\nTeflon is coming off the bottom (First week owned)\nWind is too powerful, sandwiches disassemble and fly around.\nThe timer/finished noise is extremely annoying.\nMost recipes require shaking halfway through, but there is no timer feature to allow this, the chef needs to guess when to pull it, adjust the timer preset, or stand there and watch the unit the entire time.\nA 60 day warranty is not adequate for this design.\n\nSummary:\nThis review is based on myself and my wife using only this unit around 15 times on various foods. The concept of the air fryer is amazing, That said, this unit is poorly designed and cheaply made. The Teflon is coming off the bottom, which we have probably eaten. There is a major design flaw in the drawer - after the unit heats, and the drawer is pulled out to shake the food, the drawer doesn't go back in - it tries to slide diagonally on the track, almost as if the plastic has expanded. If the drawer doesn't lock in perfectly, the unit will not turn back on, and the user is left fumbling and trying to force the red-hot drawer back in. Cooking grilled cheese is impossible, as the unit disassembles the sandwich with its powerful wind. The controls are non-intuitive and difficult to get used to, and the membrane button interface will not last the test of time. The user is forced to scroll through presets, which consist of incorrect timers. The \"Time\" and \"Temp\" controls are inadequately marked, and I find myself searching for them each time I try to cook.\n\nBottom line: I need to return our AirFryer XL 5.3 Qt and find a better-designed model, because I don't have confidence this will last the entire 60 day warranty and it cooks food unevenly."},{"reviewerName":"Tim Williams","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Stopped working after a year","reviewDate":"March 29, 2018","reviewText":"We used this for 2 months, 5-6 times per week. We used it to make french fries (which it did great at, if you boil the potatoes for 5 minutes first).\n\nBut...it stopped working just a few days before the one year mark. No power; nothing. So we email the manufacturer. They said, well you bought it from Amazon, you have to talk to them. Amazon said \"return window is 30 days, sorry\".\n\nSo don't buy it - the quality isn't worth it.

I've been using this for over six months and it was the greatest decision ever. I've made wings, a WHOLE chicken, chicken tenders, frozen burgers, even hot dogs in this fryer and they've come out amazingly. I recommend the XL because I've heard lots of people regret not getting the larger model. I have no complaints. There's definitely an adjustment period and I do check the food regularly to make sure nothing gets overcooked, but this fryer has easily cut my cooking time in half.\n\nUpdate: after about 6 months, my basket and the bin started peeling due to my excessive use of the air fryer. I still love it and use it a lot, but in the future I'll likely line my basket with parchment paper in the future (read a tip online when looking up ways to avoid peeling).

Some foods, like \"fried\" chicken, require you to turn them over every 5 minutes during a 20-minute cooking cycle. For the life of me, I cannot get the basket to line up right when I return it to the unit, so the cooking cycle won't continue.

When cooking the motor cycles on and off. When it cycles on it sounds like a jet engine taking off and continues this noise until it cycles off. When it is ready to heat back up the jet takes off again. Over and over again until the food is done. It's hard to hear the TV or concentrate when using it. And it is huge.\n\nThe basket holder drawer does not fit well. You have to work at it to get it to shut properly. Not happy with this Air Fryer.

Keep in mind whatever you put in ...","reviewDate":"February 8, 2018","reviewText":"Its a nice fryer. Keep in mind whatever you put in the fryer needs to already be oiled up. So the no oil \"air\" fryer part is only half true. If you have already frozen items that would be placed into a hot oven (like frozen fries, onion rings, fried chicken) you're good to go. It basically is a small convection oven saving on electricity or gas. But if you want to make your own home made chicken strips, they will come out bone dry. They need the oil to get that golden crisp action going on. You can put a whole small chicken in this air fryer and as long as you leave the skin on, and turn it a few times it will be beautiful.

Flimsy, lightweight plastic, glue and scratches on the top of the machine.\n\nNonetheless I was excited to use this and it had decent reviews. The size is perfect for my family. After making chicken the fryer malfunctioned and would not register the bucket after being placed back in. Thought it was a cooling safety issue so I didn’t force it and waited to retry after it completely cooled to room temp. Still didn’t work. After very forcefully pushed the bucket back in it finally clicked on. Worked for about 15 minutes, I pulled it out to check the fries and then had the same issue of the bucket not lining up again. Only this time because I had just used it I got a nice burn on my hand.\n\nI’m not giving up having an air fryer but it certainly won’t be this. Wouldn’t recommend to anyone.

I had to fight the fryer basket to lock into place. And until it is locked in place the touch screen will not work. Then, I finally got it to work and it began to cook. Halfway through my burgers cooking I wanted to flip them over. When I went to out drawer back in, it was like it had melted/warped the drawer and it wouldn't go back in at all!!! I fought with it for about 5 minutes and then finally could finish the burgers. After this debacle, I did give it one more chance. I tried to cook fries. Same issues with the drawer. And when I opened halfway through cycle to shake fries I never got it to work properly again. It would kick in for a few seconds and lose connection , then I would mess with the Drawer, getbiy to come back on to just kick back off again. I ended up just giving up and microwaving the fries.

Both were purchased at the same time. Here are the results of our head-to-head comparison. For ease I'll refer to the Innsky as INN and the AirPower XL as PXL.\n\nFirst, the TL/DR: Both are very good air fryers, with mostly minor differences. If overhead cabinet height is an issue, or you cook for more than 4 people every day, the INN may be the one for you with it's wider, shallow basket and low profile. If you mostly cook for 2-3, enjoy cooking whole chickens, and prioritize quiet, the PXL is calling your name. I've avoided buying on of these for several years, because I just didn't need one. By the end of the week I was completely sold on air frying, especially after roasting a whole chicken. In July. In a cool kitchen. In Florida. Snacks are only the tip of the iceberg for what these things can do, and do well.\n\nPower/Size/Shape: INN is 1700W/5.8QTS, PXL is 1500W/5.3QTS. Identical in footprint (width/length). The PXL is taller, making the INN the better choice for low overhead cabinets. The INN is sleek and square. The PXL is an egg, not my favorite appliance shape. INN's greater capacity and square form allow for a more spacious basket with greater surface area. The PXL's basket is significantly deeper, but that's usually wasted space because foods are best cooked in a single layer. The only drawback to the INN's shallow-ish basket comes when you want to cook a chicken larger than about 4 pounds. Ours was 4.61lbs and was taller than the basket sides, barely clearing the fan, although there was plenty of room to add veggies on the side. The 4.72lb bird in the PXL had vertical room to spare, but filled the floor of it's rectangular basket. Both baskets will easily fit corn dogs on sticks (4 in the PXL, 5 in the INN), asparagus and other long items. Recapping, the INN is sleek and short, the PXL looks bulky in comparison. The PXL's basket has less area but is much deeper, wasting space (unless roasting chicken) Advantage to INN.\n\nCooking: The INN cooks about 10 percent slower than the PXL. This only matters for foods taking longer than 10 minutes. Whole chicken took 50 minutes in the PXL, 55 minutes in the INN. Everything we cooked came out exactly the same from both fryers, with no differences that we could see or taste. In other words, they're just about equals in the cooking department, with the PXL ever so slightly faster. Draw.\n\nEase of Use: The PXL has the clear edge here. It has 7 presets, but when you hit the power button you only see time, temp and \"M\" (for Mode). It is a very clean interface. The presets are activated by pressing the M repeatedly until the one you want lights up. As soon as you set the time and temp or choose a preset mode, it starts cooking. The INN also has 7 presets, but they all light up at once, along with time and temp buttons. It makes for a very cluttered control panel. It also has a separate Start button (it looks like a video/music \"play\" button) that is located to the left of the main power button and must be pressed to begin cooking. It was all rather confusing. I quickly learned that on both fryers the presets were almost useless, because I usually ended up adjusting both the time and temp. It's easier to use the manual settings. Both have manual defaults of 370 degrees and 15 minutes. Maximum temp on both is 400 degrees. Both fryers can be paused by removing the basket. Both have positive locking baskets, making it easy to dump food out without the inner basket falling out. It was tricky to insert the INN's basket at first, because it just didn't want to click into place easily. I had to hold the fryer with one hand to keep it from moving while seating the basket with the other. That only lasted a couple of days, then the basket slid easily into position with little effort, so I didn't take off points for it. Some reviewers complained of trouble seating the PXL's basket, but liked it once they learned to tip it a little as it goes into the fryer. I'm tall and never noticed this at all. Advantage - PXL.\n\nCleaning: Both have nonstick outer and inner baskets and use the same button mechanism to release the inner basket. Draw.\n\nNoise: The fan on the INN is much louder, like a microwave oven running at full power. It also blows a lot of hot air out the rear vent. Less air escapes the PXL and it is quiet enough to hold a normal conversation while standing right in front of it. The INN would be better pulled away from the wall during use, to avoid a greasy wall. Advantage - PXL.\n\nWarranty: 2 years with 90-day money back on INN. Only 60 days on the PXL, but returnable at any time to Sam's Club. Draw.\n\nConclusion - Although I wanted to love the Innsky best because of it's good looks and wider, more square basket, in the end my husband and I were agreed that the AirPower XL was the better fit for us. We're only 2 people, so the basket floor space wasn't an issue, but with an open kitchen design, the noise level was. When we factored in Sam's easy anytime returns and that delicious chicken (and stupendous gravy!), our choice was clear. My son and DIL have 4 teenage boys and rent (cabinet configuration may change with a move), so for them the Innsky was the obvious choice. We're all completely happy with our decisions, although I do wish mine didn't look like an egg.\n\n***UPDATE***\nAfter living with our air fryer for a few months, we're still finding new ways to use it. If you haven't tasted a jalapeño popper from an air fryer, you're missing out. Air frying is the optimal cooking method for these yummy snacks. I'm on the fence about pizza rolls, still looking for our ideal temp/time combo. Another thing I've learned is that it shines at roasting vegetables. I like to roast them at 400 degrees (no need to preheat!, and find that most take half the time they did in my Breville Smart Oven, not counting the time spent preheating it. For small root veggies, like baby carrots, or cubed potatoes or squash, 10 minutes is all it takes. Baked potatoes only need 40 minutes to be perfectly cooked with a crispy skin. Green beans are roasted in 12-15 minutes (they're good tossed with parm and garlic). But my favorite veggie has to be roasted baby potatoes. Grab some baby potatoes (any variety), cut them in half, toss them in oil with salt and pepper (and anything else you like, such as garlic or thyme), than roast cut side up for 10-15 minutes, flipping halfway through. They are perfection, like creamy mashed potatoes inside but shatteringly crisp outside.\n\nI've roasted 4 chickens (we've stopped buying them from Costco, because they're so easy at home) and really nailed the recipe. Set the temp for 360 degrees, pat the chicken dry and set it in the basket, breast side up. Spray or rub it with oil then sprinkle with salt and pepper (and any other spices you desire). Cook it for 30 minutes, then flip it so the back is up. Cook for another 20 minutes and it's done. You'll have about 1 cup of mostly fat in the bottom of the basket when it's done. Don't throw it away, it's liquid gold! Pour it into a nonstick skillet and turn the heat to medium. Now pour 2 cups of chicken broth into the basket and use a wooden or silicone spoon to scrape up any remaining bits from the basket. Pour the broth back into the measuring cup. Whisk 2-3 tablespoons of flour into the fat in the skillet, whisking continuously until it is completely smooth and lump-free. Cook (still whisking) for another minute to cook off the raw flour smell. Add a pinch of poultry seasoning. Don't overdo it! Slowly add the chicken broth (still whisking to keep lumps from forming). When the gravy is the thickness you desire, it's ready. We're both in love with the chicken and gravy we get from air fryer roast chicken. The chicken is great and the gravy... it's dreamy. People will think you're a rock star in the kitchen!\n\nMy husband loves to bake wings in it for an easy lunch. He sprays them with oil, cooks them at 370 for 24 minutes, then cranks the heat up to 400 for 6 minutes. They're super crispy and ready to be tossed with your favorite sauce or eaten just as they are (his favorite). We're still experimenting, and you should do the same. Just remember to keep notes on your results!"},{"reviewerName":"kelly harris Amazon Customer","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"power air fryer xl(5.3qt)","reviewDate":"September 21, 2016","reviewText":"this air fryer is very good i cooked chicken and fries in cooked both in 18 min and i didn't have to preheat\ni am happy so far will give an update but for now its cooks the meat all the way through just like you fried it in a pan"},{"reviewerName":"J. L. Yates","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Wish I had bought one sooner","reviewDate":"November 10, 2017","reviewText":"We didn't buy ours from Amazon, which is a shock to my family. I buy almost everything from here. But, hubby wanted to get one, he had seen it on QVC and raved about how great it would be. I read the reviews here and online and Sam's Club had it cheaper than Amazon and it is less than five minute drive to SC. So, off he goes to buy one.\nWe love it, just had herb garlic butter salmon steaks and a baked potato that we fixed in it. Baked the potato six minutes in the microwave while I prepared the salmon, mixed some herbs with garlic butter and spread it on the fish. Sprinkled some fine bread crumbs on top and put some more butter mix on top of the bread crumbs. Put the two pieces of fish on one side of the divider, the two potatoes and set the timer 320 for 10 minutes, at five minutes we turned over the potatoes and set the timer for seven more minutes. Took them out and the salmon was crispy from the breading but moist inside. The potatoes had a nice taste, not the bland like normal from just the microwave. Clean up was easy, just wiped out the basket with a soapy sponge, same with the outer basket, rinsed and left them out to air dry.\nWe have had it for almost two months, stromboli, chicken, stir fry, apple turnovers, pork chops, warmed up left over pizza, french fries, beef and broccoli, cake, mini apple pie, apple crisp, and much more. There is trail and error, we tried to cook eggs, they white didn't get done. Biscuits burned on the bottom and wasn't done on the top. Learned to have the heat low, around 300 degrees and turn them over every four minutes, which was a pain and not worth it.\n.\nIs there anything wrong with it? Getting the basket back in, if you don't know to tilt it that can be frustrating, cleanup can be messy, if you have a lot of grease (we did from hamburgers). So have to be careful and take the basket out, not just turn the whole thing at a angle. Shaking it can be a pain if you leave the basket in the main compartment. Best to take it out and shake it. You have to remember to turn the fryer sideways to clean the top where the coil is, or it will give off a nasty smell from buildup of grease. Some items you have to watch, bacon went flying out of the basket as the strips weren't heavy enough to stay put. We have a wire rack from my Instant Pot pressure cooker we now use to hold bacon down or anything else that might go flying from the hot air blowing. You do have to remember to go and turn food over so it will cook evenly.\nThe good outweighs the bad, it is used more than my oven, less electricity, less heat, quicker, easier to clean up, no pain in my back trying to bend over and get food in and out. We tossed the deep fryer a week after we bought this and have no regrets.\nIs it worth buying, YES ! Would I recommend it YES ! Definitely buy a cookbook or two that is geared for using it, watch videos on youtube, cooking with doug is a good one. He has a different brand but that doesn't matter.\nMy only regret? I didn't buy it from Amazon, I trust them, I don't trust Wal-Mart, they sell junk,"},{"reviewerName":"R.

In order \"shake\" fries or any other food that needs shaking or flipping, you need to pull the basket out. And here comes the problem you can not put the basket back in until the unit cools down which can take up to 20 minutes. It's very aggravating needing to wait to continue cooking. For its important to be able to check your food for readiness without the fight of putting back the basket. I read this problem from other posts and I gambled anyways. Cooks really well, food comes out great but I can't deal with this issue. I will eventually replace this unit with another maker soon enough."},{"reviewerName":"Debbie M","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Not worth the money","reviewDate":"August 1, 2019","reviewText":"February 10, 2019 I purchased this Power XL Air Fryer from Sam's Club. It has been a great appliance and our family has really enjoyed it. I have cooked amazing fried chicken, pork chops, veggies, hard boiled eggs, all with great success. Last night I fixed baked potatoes and I guarantee they were the BEST baked potatoes ever. When I started to wash the air fryer, I noticed a scratch on the drip pan (the outside pan). I rubbed my finger over it and discovered it was not a scratch, but the black coating was coming off. I rinsed the pan with water and more started to come off. Today I called Tristar Products and they told me they were sorry, but they don't have a replacement drip pan, I have to purchase a new air fryer. I read the reviews before I purchased this and saw several people complain about the coating peeling off, but I just knew they put their pan in the dishwasher and that caused the problem. I have NEVER put mine in the dishwasher and it still happened. I will purchase a new air fryer, but I promise you, it will not be the Power Air Fryer XL.

It is almost impossible to get it back into place once you remove it to stir or shake what you are cooking. I read the reviews before I purchased it & thought perhaps people were not replacing the basket correctly. Well maybe some of us got defective machines. I can't believe all of the machines are that hard to replace the basket, if they were, nobody would give them a good review. After one use, we returned it for a refund. Also the cookbook that came with it stated to blanch the potatoes before doing the french fries. That is kind of defeating the purpose of the machine. Good luck to anyone purchasing this machine."},{"reviewerName":"Gary N","rating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Not at all like in the infomercials","reviewDate":"January 9, 2019","reviewText":"I bought my GF a smaller model from another brand and I liked it enough to get the XL. It seems as if the cook times and temperatures are all way off across the industry because hers and mine suffer from under cooking everything by the timer and temperatures listed in the (It's NOT a book) cook pamphlet.\n\nFirst off, french fries.\n\nMaking three potatoes is not a great substitute for french fried potatoes. But they are easy and you may have time to diddle more with them than I do so YMMV.\n\nI always make three medium to large potatoes which barely fills the basket 1/4 of the way. The problems are:\n\n1. I have to add 8 minutes cook time to get the potatoes soft enough so you know they're cooked. Not like fried in oil soft, just not hard... let's call it \"Al dente\" because unless you lower the temperature and turn the potatoes a LOT I think they'll burn / dehydrate before they're properly done.\n\n2. Even though I flipped them many times many came out burned. Gee, raw potatoes or burned, hmmm... let me think on that...\n\nChicken\n\nThe recipe in the pamphlet for flour coated chicken is terrible. Bread them.\n\nWhen I cook four thighs I have to keep on turning them over to keep them from being burned. After the timer expires, there is still blood on the bones, so I put them back in for eight minutes at 290 degrees, AND turn them again at the 4 minute mark.\n\nThe chicken is actually quite good... it's moist (dark meat only here) and IMO nearly as good as fried without the oil.\n\nGeneral stuff.\n\nThe basket is Waayyy oversize. Unless you're wanting to cook some sort of roast anything more than 4 pieces of chicken doesn't work for me. Luckily that's all I need.\n\nThe case gets pretty hot, and the exhaust is out the back and upwards. I turned it sideways over my sink to keep the hot air off of my wood cabinets.\n\nCleanup is easy, I use paper towels to soak up fat and breadcrumbs and wash the cook bins with dawn. The pieces are a bit big for a dishwasher as they take up too much space, hand washing is easier.\n\nThe inside of the frying \"chamber\" stays clean and a damp rag is all you need to make sure it's OK for the next meal.\n\nOne final thing, my kitchen has a 20 amp fuse for appliances, and even with my microwave on a defrost cycle the XL does NOT trip the breaker.\n\nIIRC, 1700 watts is about max on a 15 amp circuit so bear that in mind if you have an older kitchen with a 15 amp breaker you may trip it if you try to use the microwave, make coffee, a bagel or toast, or most any kitchen appliance you may want to use while the XL is running."},{"reviewerName":"C.

Fast forward to October 2019, and suddenly the fan/motor noise isn't as loud, which you might think would be nice, but clearly indicates a problem when things aren't as browned when the timer runs out, and when I remove the basket from the machine to shake it, the motor keeps running. I've tried deeply cleaning it, thinking perhaps there was some food residue causing an issue, but that made no difference. I was stunned to see it only has a 60 day warranty. I will be replacing this air fryer in the near future (Black Friday sales, anybody?), but certainly not with another ASOTV Power AirFryer product. My next air fryer will be purchased based on deep research and not just price and how many stars it had.
