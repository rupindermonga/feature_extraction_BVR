This means it gets to be taken out, used, cleaned, and stored away quite often. This air fryer feels sturdy but not heavy. Once the frying compartment is clicked into place, the whole unit can be easily lifted with the handle and be moved around. The frying compartment is roomy enought to cook (each time) a thick cut 12 oz steak; a large size blooming onion; 3 skewers each with generous chunks of meat and veggie. One time we used it to degrease some fresh bacon and were pleasantly surprised how well it did the job.\n\nWe do use a parchment paper liner everytime we cook to help protect the non-stick surface of the screen. Learning from our mistakes with using other non-stick cookwares over the years, we do not let the scouring side of the sponge touch the non-stick surface when cleaning it. So far the cleaning has been very easy. We are very happy with this purchase."},{"reviewerName":"Parker","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Game Changer","reviewDate":"October 8, 2018","reviewText":"I was skeptical of getting an air fryer. I found this model at a pretty decent price and it is a decent size. I have literally been cooking everything in this air fryer and couldn't be happier. Just wish I would have pulled the trigger earlier. The lcd screen allows you to very easily set the time and temperature. Only bad thing can be cleaning if you make something messy, but I usually just throw it in my dishwasher and it comes out nice.

He threw the fries away (no fault of the fryer) but it is different from an oil deep fryer. Soaking the potatoes after cutting them for an hour or two is helpful.

I enjoyed tasting my food, not the grease."},{"reviewerName":"Amber","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Life Saver !!!!","reviewDate":"August 18, 2018","reviewText":"The only reason i didn't give this thing 5 stars is because i haven't had it very long so i don't know how it holds up with repeated use yet, only time will tell that but so far it is a life saver ! i Have three boys plus my fiance' to feed and the ultralean makes those night when i get home from work and am just too tired to cook so very very easy. I cannot even explain how much this helps me. You just set the temp and the time and go. You don't have t wait for the oven to pre-heat and the food cooks quickly and is always really good ! I am going to start making more variety of food and see how things turn out. UPDATE ***\nSo.... My air fryer has recently been displaying the error code E1 and I'd not covered in the booklet that came with it? From what I have been looking up, I am probably going to have to replace the whole thing and after not even a year's use out if yet, I am not happy at all.

It's difficult to clean (food residue from grilled chicken doesn't come off easily plus there are lots of little nooks for the food to hide) and the paint on the grill is not very durable. You can see from the photo where the paint has come off in multiple places (I used a Scotch-Brite pad to clean it).

Before this, I used a typical oil fryer. My husband, who can be a very picky eater, was skeptical about his French fries in an air fryer. We made frozen McCain French fries in it and they came out perfect. They tasted a little different from NOT being suspended in oil, but they had a perfect crunch with a still soft inside. My husband was quite pleased there was not much of a difference in taste or crispiness. It is VERY LARGE. I thought it would be about the size of our 12 cup coffee pot, but it was a lot bigger.

It does the job pretty good. I've cooked chicken fingers, fish sticks, tater tots, shake n bake, chicken wings... I even cook those frozen hamburger patties. It does a much better job than the oven. Not quite a crispy at dumping your food into a big pot of hot grease, but definitely cleaner and easier, not to mention healthier. It may take an attempt or two to figure out the times, temps, and technique that suit you, but once you do it makes cooking crispy food a breeze.\n\nThis size is just about right for two people.\n\nI usually hand wash the basket and tray, but have also tossed them in the dishwasher with no ill-effects."},{"reviewerName":"Manuel Darosa","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Wate of money","reviewDate":"April 7, 2019","reviewText":"It cooks very small amounts of food.

Food is good and crispy. The only problem I have is that you can't easily get your food out without the grease getting all over it. You could take out the grill but it's cumbersome and you have to balance your food so it doesn't fall into the grease. You can't dump it out because grease would get all over the place. It should have a removable grease tray. Also, cleaning is weird because of the vents on the side. Grease and pieces of food get stuck in them so you have to be really mindful of that while cleaning."},{"reviewerName":"Jasmine C","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Love it!!","reviewDate":"December 19, 2018","reviewText":"Love it very easy to use and clean.

I have made fries, fish, shrimp, potatoes, and bacon in this marvel! The flavor is amazing and I have not used any oil yet. I did purchase an accessory kit but have not used it yet - still making things as it came.\n\nI am great at burning things in the pan and in the oven.

You definitely have to change a few things with time, temperatures and preparation of food. It doesn’t taste like it’s been fried, that can be good or bad.

This was one of the cheaper models I found on Amazon so I was worried it might not lost, but it is still making some good food. Only issues I've had with it are: 1. The buttons on the front do have a cheap quality to them, specifically the power button gets stuck if pushed the wrong way. 2.

I rave about airfrying to everyone I know. I cook 10x more than I ever did. HOWEVER this morning as I was preparing my lunch for work, I noticed it began to smoke up and upon further investigation was melting/burning the bottom plastic of the air fryer. There is now a giant hole in it and I'm assuming it is no longer usable. I don't know if the air fryer itself com-busted, or if a fuse in my power outlet caused it to essentially blow up, but either way I'm v upset.\n\nstill giving it 3 stars bc I loved it while it last and I'll still be getting another air fryer, but probably not this one just to be safe."},{"reviewerName":"CindieLuchy","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Easy to use and excellent, reliable product!","reviewDate":"October 30, 2019","reviewText":"Wow!

I have cooked several things in it, but have been mostly disappointed. The tator tots were good - browned and crispy and so were the potato wedges. However, the breaded okra with potatoes were yucky looking and tasting. You actually have to add as much extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), coconut oil, etc., as you would normally do for oven baking or frying on top of the stove. It came with little to none instructions, so you either have to do research or \"wing-it\". My daughter received a Ninja Air Fryer for Christmas which gives more and better instructions.

Overall, it's a nice air fryer. We use it several times a week. The size is great for 2-3 people. It seems to cook faster than most recipes state, so that's a learning curve. Two things I'm not happy with:\n1. It's hard to clean the center of the insert. There's a small bar running over the middle, and food gets cooked on underneath.\n2. The side vents on the basket vent up. If you have any liquid created while cooking, it spills out if you tip the basket to empty. Also grease and pieces of food get stuck in the vents, so you have to be really diligent when cleaning. If they vented down, you could rinse the vents under water to remove any debris.\n\nI'm not sure how these two quirks compare to other air fryers, but they are something I'd check out before purchasing another one."},{"reviewerName":"Jantz","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Cheap","reviewDate":"October 2, 2019","reviewText":"Recieved as a gift and pulled it our of box.

I have had fun experimenting and find it very simple to use. Not a rule follower, I tried leaving the skins on potatoes to \"fry\" and just blotting the cut strips with paper towels rather than doing all of the soaking and rinsing. I sprayed with cooking oil instead of coating with regular oil. I've guessed at temperatures and cooking times when cooking something not included in the recipes. I think I would compare it to baking in the oven more than frying, which I rarely do. It's super simple to check the status of something you're cooking and then adjust time and temperature if you want. I have cooked brownies and corn bread, using my own recipes in a small souffle dish. I'm just careful not to over fill a cooking dish that has batter in it. I use it while doing the remaining foods for a meal. Easy to clean. I love it!"},{"reviewerName":"J.

Instructions said 10-12 minutes on 400 degrees then turn them over and cook for another 8 minutes. I think we did 11 minutes and they were slightly over-done, so maybe next time we'll try 10 minutes on the first side and perhaps 7 minutes on the other side instead of the 8-minute recommendation.

Before, I'd throw them in the microwave and of course, the crust was mushy. The oven would take too long. They came out perfect. Crunchy crust and melted on the inside. The Teflon makes cleaning a breeze. It's also very easy to use. The digital screen is easy to use and understand. I'm single so this size is just right.

I wouldn't say that it fried them the way oil does it. To me it still felt like I'm eating a bake version. That being said it is a lot faster than the over. 10 min to cook a burger is not to shabby in my books. The basket is not fully enclose though so oil and grease will leak out if you pull it out and tilt it some. Just be careful and try to keep everything level. Cleaning is also not the easiest as gunk and grease from the food do get caught in the air holes and there is a lot of them."},{"reviewerName":"Wayne A.","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Sets off smoke alarm","reviewDate":"January 27, 2019","reviewText":"I have experimented with frozen vegetables, French fries, and a whole chicken.

The first thing I cooked was my motivation for buying one. I like french fries & I don't want tor unto the fast food joint. Tried baking, tried deep fry, tried free, tried frozen & was always disappointed UNTIL NOW! In 7 minutes I can and do have fresh crispy hot french fries whenever I want them and if I don't stop I will add 10 lbs. YES I have done numerous other things -so easy, no real cleaning effort and you get get results. I like the smaller size for just me--I rarely write rave review or negative reviews & never this long but I encourage you to try this one & yes Walmart has cheaper ones BUT this is the one you want! I took it to my sons house & did a cooking demo & they will be ordering and I bought a second one as a gift for a friend."}],"qAndA":[{"question":"which air fryer is good for europe that has dual voltage ?","answer":"The ultrean...is one of the best...for the money"},{"question":"Is there a trick to pulling out the basket?
