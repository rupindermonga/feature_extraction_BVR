This seller is the best, I loved my Air Fryer and I do not blame them for a rare failure, parts do fail, but the speed and care that the are showing a customer is amazing.

Have had the unit since 4/28/18 so it hasn’t quite been 2 months. One of the screws on the basket holder has rusted. More bothersome is that the handle no longer locks in place making this a safety hazard which is why I gave it one star. The unit has been used a total of about 10 times so I really am bummed. I went with the good ratings this unit had... having said that, it does work well but is no longer any good to me.\n\nPRODUCT UPDATE\nI have changed my one star review to 4 stars for the following reasons. First off, when I left the original review my return window had closed by almost a month so I figured all was lost. What I should have done was to have contacted the seller. I never had a complaint about the performance of the air fryer as it worked and still does work perfectly. It was in the handle and basket that I had an issue as stated above. So I placed my one star review based on the fact that the product had become hazardous. In about a day, I heard from the seller to verify my address so that they could send me replacements for what was defective. I did in fact verify it and did receive brand new parts and now the fryer is as good as new! Excellent customer service even when I wasn’t looking for it! It’s nice to know there is still good customer service out there! Thank you!"},{"reviewerName":"Joe Webb","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Do not over fill, do shake contents while cooking, use as much as possible","reviewDate":"January 13, 2018","reviewText":"I absolutely love this thing. My girlfriend first saw the philips brand one onlin and we began looking into them. Turns out most air dryers have a very small capacity for food but this puppy is cheaper and had a 4liter area to fry food. I bought one for her for Christmas and we have used it every single day to air fry meats, vegetables, frozen foods and even air fry cookie dough! They tell you to shake the cooker rack ever 5 minutes to ensure your food frys evenly and this is important. Shake every few minutes because just like a microwave, food cooks faster on the outside than the inside. The moral of the story here is do not over fill the container. We got so excited one night and sliced up as many sweet potatoes as we could fit into the air fryer and it took about twice as long to cook them to crispy perfection as it did with half the amount of potatoes in the container. I have been extremely satisfied that I purchased it and love the air fryer mostly because all of my meat I no longer grill but instead I air fry it. Meat cooked in here stays juicy and the out side cooks to a perfect golden crispy color!"},{"reviewerName":"Ajdg","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"WOW! - I even cooked a 5lb turkey in this thing!","reviewDate":"January 21, 2017","reviewText":"Never heard about air fryers until recently. Did my research and decided upon the Secura 1500. First time using it I was a little skeptical and not sure what I was doing. So, I first tried something easy. Sweet potato fries, how hard could that be. Well, not only was it easy to do, but the results were beyond my expectations. Truly did last and feel like deep fried potatoes. Then I went on to bigger and better. Did a Cornish hen. Never cooked one in my life, so again I wasn't sure. Followed the instructions in a recipe book I purchased and success, again! Then I said, OK lets try a pizza. Within 10 minutes prep and 12 minutes cooking I had a great pizza for two. It was so good I tried it again 2 more times using different toppings. I'm hooked. So then I figured lets break the winning streak with an experiment. I purchased a 5lb. frozen turkey breast. I let it thaw, brushed some lite oil mixed with spices on the bird and placed it in the basket. The only problem was the bird was a little too fat and wouldn't let me close the basket without cutting about an inch off the breast. Once I did that, away she went and about 55 minutes later I had the most delicious, tender and moist turkey dinner. This bird was enough for 4+ adults. Overall I find this style of cooking the easiest and cleanup is a breeze. Most dinner portions are good for 2 - 4 people depending on what you're making. Oh, did I tell you how much I love this thing? Best appliance I purchased. Well, add that to the Secura milk frother - love that one too, for my after dinner lattes."},{"reviewerName":"William","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"DON'T BE FOOLED - This Is a Competent Machine !!!","reviewDate":"July 15, 2018","reviewText":"I'd like to address the negative reviews. After all, the positive reviews offer a wealth of positive information and are accurate. First of all, the unit is high grade construction as the interior has a full metal lining which acts as a heat shield. There is no burning or melting of any plastic, nor is there a plastic smell with use. Secondly, the controls are simple, well designed, easy to read and work like a charm. They should prove to be more reliable than digital controls and definitely faster to program. Next, the non-stick coatings simply do not chip or flake and appear to be the best quality. Furthermore, as noted repeatedly, the unit is incredibly easy to clean by hand. As far as noise, the machine is quiet with just a subtle fan sound so noise is not even close to being an issue. Lastly, the unit does brown on top and does cook the inside. In fact when I got this terrific beast (1500 Watts), I only had a London Broil to try it out. Can you imagine testing an air-fryer with a big hunk of meat that is best cooked in an oven on broil or grilled.. To my surprise this baby air -fried it to perfection. It was charred on the outside and juicy medium on the inside. Amazing since it was about an inch and one half thick and took 1/2 the time, just 18 minutes. My advice would be to disregard some of the ridiculous reviews that have proved nonsense as far as my experience. In summary, the 4.6 excellent rating is justified here. This is a very generous capacity powerhouse with too many positives to ignore at this price point.\n\nUPDATE..... Found this independent review Below.\n\nFrying Quality\nEase of Cleaning\nWarranty\nFryers that made crisp, evenly-cooked food scored highest. Higher is Better.\n6 SECURA 93.0 %\n1 NUWAVE BRIO 93.0 %\n2 BELLA 80.0 %\n3 PHILIPS 98.0 %\nCATEGORY AVERAGE 85.22 %\n\nThe Secura Hot Air Fryer was a decent contender in our testing. It tied for the second-best score on our food frying tests and was one of the best at cooking evenly, though it did have darker and lighter spots in some batches. As with any air fryer, you can prevent uneven cooking by shaking the basket to rotate the food, but the Secura did a decent job even when we didn’t shake the basket, and that's impressive.\nThe Secura will shut itself down after a cooking cycle. It also has non-skid feet and stays cool to the touch so it scores high for safety. It is a good fit for those who have kids in their household. This is also a good fit for families because of its large capacity. The basket is huge, fitting almost twice as much food as some of the smaller competitors.\n\nThe two-year warranty on this one is nice. That is double what most of our tested products have. This air fryer doesn’t have instructional videos, though these products are not all that hard to use.\n\nMost of the fryers we reviewed were louder than we expected, but this was one of the quieter ones. All but two of them were louder than this one. The Secura also gets a perfect score for cleaning. The non-stick basket was easy to clean in the sink, in seconds. It can also go in the dishwasher if you want to save even more time\n\nSummary\nThe Secura Hot Air Fryer has all of the important safety features and offers easy cleaning and quiet operation. It churned out some really good food. Its large capacity, and associated bulky design, is bad for cramped quarters but\ngood for feeding a crowd, which makes it a great option for large families."},{"reviewerName":"Princess","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"very good quality","reviewDate":"May 28, 2018","reviewText":"I did days of research even went to consumer reports on line.. we first bought one at walmart that consumer reports had recommended but when we got home and opened it up it was not sturdy and was cheaply made .

I made french fries for lunch - but did not peel or soak the potatoes as directed. Note I did use small potatoes of all different colors, even purple. The potatoes went so fast with the kids I had to make another batch. For dinner I did green beans. I washed the green beans used a smidge of oil, like 1/2 teaspoon or less tossed with red pepper flakes, bread crumbs and nutritional yeast. Was amazing! I can't wait to continue experimenting.

My teens prefer to cook using the air fryer instead of the oven. The little book that provides guidelines for cooking time and temperature were a nice touch. The images on the front of the air fryer provide temperature information but the book provides guidelines on length of time to cook the food. It even provides suggestions on when to add a little oil to what you are cooking. Having the air fryer has made life easier. No messy oil cleanup and no lingering fried oil smell in the house which I used to hate. Everything turns out crisp and delicious.

The 1st, a premium Phillips model, had a fry basket/drainage tray made of wire that was very hard to clean chicken skin off of. The 2nd brand was easier to clean but the nonstick coating wore off the basket way too quickly. This one has better drainage holes and seems well made. I air fry the best chicken wings with no oil, the best french fries just like McDonalds with no oil, the best rib eye steak with no oil, the best bacon which comes out drained already in the fryer basket.

I did thoroughly wash all components before use, so I'm assuming part of the initial process involves cooking off the odor/flavor before use. Not sure.\nI would liken this air fryer to a countertop sized oven.. or an oddly shaped toaster oven. It just did not live up to my expectations. If you're desperate for crispy-ish chicken without the calories of fried food or a desire to preheat an oven, this is a good option. I, personally, just couldn't justify having a $90 food reheater because I certainly was not going to use it for \"frying\" anymore."},{"reviewerName":"Happy Texan","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"It's Okay","reviewDate":"August 12, 2017","reviewText":"It took three tries but I finally prepared some French fries that were close to right.

My only complaint is when you want to dump the basket, you have to contend with the drawer it is in. You can't just leave the drawer in the air fryer, it comes out with the basket so you have to leave it attached when you dump the basket or find someplace to leave it (outside the fryer) while you dump the basket. Leaving it attached when you dump the basket makes it kind of heavy and awkward..\n\nBeing a hard core deep fat fryer addict, I didn't think I'd like the air fryer but I was wrong.

Read a lot of reviews on a lot of Air Fryers before selecting this one. Main points for me where: compact footprint, square basket (fits more than a round one would), knobs rather than digital controls and overall reviews. Have had this for about a month now and use frequently. Perfect size for two people. Extremely easy to use. I cut parchment squares to put in the bottom of the unit (under the pan) to help catch any drips, but honestly this thing requires so little oil that there are little to no drips during cooking. One thing I wasn't thinking we'd use it for is rolls/biscuits. When cooking a \"stove top\" dinner I'd always forget to turn the oven on to preheat if we wanted rolls or biscuits. By the time I thought of doing so it was too late to get it preheated and rolls done. With this air fryer I set the temp on 360, put four rolls or biscuits in the pan (this is where that square shape comes in handy as there's plenty of room) set the timer at five to six minutes and hot rolls are done! Also great from low oil fries. We have tried bag fries and Sea Pack shrimp but ultimately we purchased to cook healthier alternatives so our home made fries (regular or sweet potato) are great!

The air frier produced crispy fries in without all the hassle. It really did the trick.

After researching many different units before deciding on this one we are certain we made the right choice! The unit itself holds a good amount of food - definitely enough room for 2-3 people. You can probably get 4 cuts of meat in it, but we just haven't had a reason to cook that much at our place. The unit's footprint makes it less of a counter space hog in the kitchen and I like the design of the knobs vs. digital push buttons. We started out with chicken cutlets and they came out perfectly juicy and seasoned. Followed up with pork and also cooked biscuits and a small cake in it. In all cases, the unit cooked beautifully. You will no doubt have to experiment with times, etc., but everything we have done so far has come out well. An added bonus is that the house no longer smells like a deep fryer from cooking on the stove top! Clean up is also a breeze. The basket releases from the tub unit and both are easy to wash and wipe down. Though there is little oil, we suggest putting either aluminum foil or, our preference, parchment paper in the bottom of the unit to make clean up even easier! We just cut several pieces into the correct size and have them on hand when needed. Final thought, we did buy an oil mister for those times when we cook items without a lot of natural oils in them. We haven't had the need to use it yet, but do have several friends with air fryers who believe an oil mister is a must have so you may want to set your kitchen up with that as well.

Some have said it's not that noisy and everyone has their own acceptable levels, but to me, this is pretty loud. When it's tucked in the corner of my kitchen, some of the noise gets lost in the walls. When it's in the middle of the kitchen island, it sounds like you're next to an extremely loud fan. Which would be fine if you're leaving the kitchen while it cooks. I like to watch TV from the living room while cooking so it's a little too loud for my liking.\n\nIt does make things crispy. Not nearly as well as I was hoping and no where near like a deep fryer would. But crispier than microwaving for sure.\n\nMy favorite thing to make so far is a grilled cheese sandwhich. It cooks it perfectly (most of the time). Sometimes when you put the sandwhich in and close the door, the top slice of bread slips off and gets a little burned on top.

Wang","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Ok overall, but with an extremely annoying design flaw","reviewDate":"October 28, 2018","reviewText":"Air fryers are basically toaster ovens with enhanced convection mode on all the time. They do work better than regular toast ovens in certain tasks, such as reheating french fries or chicken nuggets.\n\nThis fryer is of medium size, and the power level is adequate. The non-stick coating works fine. The elevated wire stand meant to help air circulation is, however, very poorly designed and built. The gaps are way too big to keep fries or nuggets in place. It also comes without coating, and therefore always ends up with food sticking to it. Using it is a constant struggle and source of frustration."},{"reviewerName":"Monica","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"I should've Purchased This A Long Time Ago","reviewDate":"August 19, 2017","reviewText":"I should've purchased this a long time ago.

I live in a relatively warm environment and the house holds heat in a way that can make you re=think turning on your oven in the summer. This eliminates having to reconsider what you want to eat because you don't want to use the oven. This is quick easy and the clean up job makes it that much more attractive. I can do french fries without oil I can heat up left overs in 5 min. I don't even have to add time to pre-heat. It's literally 5 min from the time you think of it.

The controls are simple and less complicated then a toaster oven.\n\nFor the first run I purchased 7 pounds of chicken wings. Divided them up into four servings. So figure about 1.75 pounds. This equated to roughly 25 wings. That I seasoned in a ziplock bag and dumped into the fryer basket. As some reviewers suggested I mixed a few tablespoons of cooking oil into my seasoning and sweet tai chili sauce. I did forget to line the pull out tray with foil. The 25 wings filled the bottom of the basket with only one or two wings making a second layer. (I have the mid size unit). I did remember to shake the wings mid way through the time cycle. The initial directions of 360 degrees for I believe it was 24 minutes after a 4 minute warm up cycle was insufficient. I had to add about 15 minutes including bumping the temp up to 400 degrees for the last five minutes. The results were perfection. Caramelized sauce and moist fully cooked meat.\n\nSo do not expect recommended times to be spot on. You will have to experiment. Despite forgetting the foil. Clean up was a breeze because I rinsed it out quickly.

So having a freezer full of fryer-ready foods and a fryer not working is a bummer. I think its the button that depresses inside when the basket is pushed in, that is not working properly, because I noticed early on that the plastic inner basket was wearing out and cracking in that spot and suspect this is the weak link that just quit. It seems the timer is the old fashioned egg timer type as it runs independent of the rest (keeps ticking when basket is pulled out). Both timer must be on and basket pushed all the way in for over to heat but after a couple times where it worked off and on, finally stopped altogether (tried to see if depressing the button kicks it on but it doesn't so maybe there is more contact needed).\n\nThere is only enough room in the basket for one decent serving of fries and using the rack to stack them seems to interfere with optimum crispness. This is really just big enough for one person.\n\nI suspect that the max 400 degree setting is actually cooking a tad cooler, maybe 375, but it does ok with foods recommended for 400.\n\nUnless you want foods drying out, preheat first for a minute or two. Oh, and if using foil to cover your food you need to have the food weigh down the foil (wrap completely) or the fan will push the foil up into the overhead burner. I find if the foil is a square, just bend the corners up toward a tip and the foil can be used to lift the food out (it doesn't retain heat)."},{"reviewerName":"Curlygirl","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Air Fryers live up to the hype","reviewDate":"June 1, 2018","reviewText":"For anyone thinking about getting an air fryer, do it!

You can reheat ( frozen) fried chicken or egg rolls and they come out like the day you ordered them. NOTHING has ever been such a game changer for me! It's a breeze to rinse out the basket and tray between uses...but there are no other instructions as to the maintenance of the oven. My only issue is the cleaning of the actual inside of the oven. There is a lot of grease build up and since it is so close to the coils, I am worried about a fire. I have scoured the internet on tips to effectively clean it...but the standard 'soap and water' suggestions do not work.

You don't need grease to cook in, and what grease there is in the chicken skin end up in the bottom of the pan, not on your chicken.

Also, if you're trying to consume healthy, more expensive fats, such as coconut oil, palm oil, and lard, using the air fryer saves a lot of money since you're not filling a giant pan with expensive coconut oil."},{"reviewerName":"LisaR","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"... necessarily the quality of the product but I am disappointed.

We have used it maybe 7 times and each time we are shocked at how well things turn out. It's better than using the oven because it doesn't heat up the entire kitchen. Things also turn out better. French fries are amazing. Taquitos nice and crunchy. Chicken tender and juicy. LOVE how it cooks.\n\nThe reason I am giving it 3 stars is because of the build quality. As you can see by the pictures I posted the screws are rusting. These are the screws on the inside of the drawer at the top. There are 4 of them and all 4 are rusting. You're supposed to wash it with a soft sponge and mild soap, so it's going to get wet. Why would you not use screws that won't rust? I haven't contacted customer service yet, but that's coming in the next couple of days.\n\nDepending on the response I get I'll update my review."},{"reviewerName":"Wilma Cruz","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Love it","reviewDate":"August 6, 2019","reviewText":"We are enjoying having this in our kitchen. We burnt our first batch of French fries, but we learned to not just set the timer and let it do its thing. We set the timer for close to the time we figure it will take, but check the product several times during the cooking process to get it just right. I have made cheese crisps in it. I love my frozen burritos crispy, so I thaw them out a bit in the microwave, spray Pam on both sides, then start it up in the air fryer; so good!"},{"reviewerName":"jamie1972","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Awesome Air Fryer","reviewDate":"September 11, 2018","reviewText":"What did we ever so without this air fryer?! It is fast, quiet, and doesn't heat up the kitchen like oil frying. Beyond EASY to clean.

At first I was having a problem getting the skin on fish to have that “crunch” as if you put it in oil and fried it. But after trial and error I now have the same tasting outcome without the hassle of cleaning up oil splatter all over the place. FYI just lightly spray it with an oil and your good to go. For all other food products it works great as well. Makes delicious wings and fries. I did go with the bigger 4.2 qt simply because I like lots of food."},{"reviewerName":"Cynthia","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"LOVE it","reviewDate":"December 14, 2018","reviewText":"Use this for anything and everything I normally cook in the oven or reheat in the microwave. Makes food crispy! Clean up at first was very easy but seems to get harder everytime for some reason\n\nUpdate, I ran the basket through the dishwasher and it is junk now. Loved it the first year, but it is not easy cleanup or dishwasher safe as advertised.\n\nUpdate, still using this but the basket is just gross and won't come clean so we line it with foil. I will definately buy another air fryer but just not this brand."},{"reviewerName":"Calvin Schaeffer","rating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Stopped working in less than 2 months.","reviewDate":"February 10, 2019","reviewText":"I purchased this air fryer for my wife for Christmas.

We've used this to cook bacon, French fries, potato wedges from fresh potatoes, taquitos, tortilla chips from fresh tortillas, and chicken wings. All turned out crispy and like they were fried rather than baked, but without the heavy oil taste. It's also great for reheating fried food leftovers. Definitely recommend this if you're looking to try an air fryer.\n\nUpdate December 2018: We use this fryer every day.

It doesn't give off much heat so is good for summer cooking. I bought one for my daughter in southern Illinois and it is all she uses in the summer heat. It would be nice if the minutes could be set individually because it is marked in 5 minute increments.

The reviews were great and it seemed a better fit so I can cook more at once to last a few days. I was especially interested in the rack for the skewers for Shish-kabobs. I used it for the first time tonight for chicken breasts and all I can say, is they turned out better than any I have ever cooked. Moist, browned, and perfect with just a little garlic salt and smoked maple seasoning sprinkled on. I can't wait to try other things. This is perfect for my new healthier lifestyle. And it's easy! Love it."},{"reviewerName":"BikerBill","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Good product, works as advertised ...","reviewDate":"July 17, 2018","reviewText":"I love it!!

Frozen pizzas cook on top but the under crust is soft, not crunchy. I re-red instruction booklet. Tried cooking longer but too burned and under side was still not crunchy.

This is my first review. I wish it could have been a positive one. Right now I am not very happy at all. I really wanted French fries tonight :( I would give it 0 stars, because to me, it is a piece of junk, but I wasn't allow to give a review unless I hit 1 star. I wore my hand out tonight trying to separate the basket from the pan & it would not come apart. It is my second try at unsuccessfully doing this & finally I have come to the conclusion that it is either defective or a piece of junk! Either way, there is a very flimsy plastic button that is suppose to allow you to remove the basket from the pan, but it doesn't. At least the one I received doesn't. There seems to be a little melted edge on one side of the plastic, & I don't know it that is how it is supposed to be or if it is a factory defect. I have been wanting an air fryer for some time & I chose to order this brand because I do have the Secura electric tea kettle which I absolutely love. I was very disappointed with this product. I can't even use it to see how it works because the basket won't separate from the pan. I need to find out how to return it. If anyone knows of a really quality air fryer please pass that information on.

My first use of this was for sweet potato fries, and I was disappointed. They were burnt around the edges, and tasted just like they do when they come out of my convection oven. The next attempt was \"fried\" chicken legs. I ran water over them to make them wet, then dropped them in a bag with gluten-free bread crumbs to evenly coat. Sprayed with a little Canola oil spray, and they came out a crunchy on the inside, and juicy on the inside, delicious! I over-crowded though, so they weren't completely done, so make sure there is space between them, not touching everywhere. I had 6 in there, but 4 should have been the limit. I've tried lamb chops which came out beautiful. I suggest buying a few Air Fryer books at the same time you purchase this, since the manual has very little information. Many recipes are available online too."},{"reviewerName":"Smartbuyer4","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"No regrets, love using this to make healthier meals","reviewDate":"January 18, 2017","reviewText":"This air fryer has pleasantly surprised me. I find myself using it more often than I originally thought I would. The size is good for my household, it's nice to air fry potatoes, sweet potatoes (boniato), yellow sweet plantain, chicken nuggets and steak. I love yellow fried plantain and this provides me with a much healthier option, it cooks it well and crispy. This air fryer is practical, easy to use, light weight, easy to clean - thus far wonderful. Food cooks quicker when I preheat (as instructed), it's advisable to shake items around a couple of times or use tongs to move items around for even cooking. It takes practice, and cooking time depends on the volume placed, the less you place in the fryer, the faster it'll cook. The most notable difference for me is the appearance - it looks dry, but once you bite in you realize it's soft and juicy."},{"reviewerName":"Meghan","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Worth it, even if you miss the coupon code!","reviewDate":"July 1, 2019","reviewText":"We have not been using this every single day, but not a week has gone by since purchase that we haven't used it.

Is it perfect? No (more on that below), but pretty great.\n\nI've reheated restaurant steak fries and cooked homemade chicken fingers so far, and I was pleased with both.\n\nI hate throwing away food. When we eat out, I ALWAYS have leftovers; at a typical casual place, I probably bring home, on average, about a third of my food ... including lots of fries. Unfortunately, reheated fries (indeed, reheated fried things generally) are merely edible ... never good. The first thing I cooked was left-over steak fries from a national chain. The machine achieved what a standard oven and a microwave are unable to: reheated fries that are crisp outside and hot and tasty inside ... and no mush ... at all. (The fries didn't stay great for long -- I had at best 10 good minutes to enjoy them; but I suspect that's not a shortcoming of the machine, but a fact of life of the chemistry and physics of a twice-cooked potato product. I'm not holding that against the machine ... just treating it as something I should keep in mind going forward.)\n\nAfter that, I dredged five chicken tenderloins in seasoned flour, immersed them in beaten egg, then pressed seasoned panko on them. Results after about 17 minutes (flipping twice): completely-cooked through; juicy; and a crunchy, browned crust. Zero complaints on the chicken.\n\nI mentioned that it's not perfect; now about that. ...\n\nWhile cooking, there was a slight plastic smell in the kitchen. That didn't affect the smell or taste of the actual food. I think this is a MINOR issue ... a non-issue to me, but some other people might be turned off.\n\nThe basket (though larger than typical of those of units at about the same price-point) does limit how much one can cook at any time. It's ideal for feeding one person or cooking a side dish for a few people (four-ish, I'd say); but preparing an entire meal for more than a couple people would take a long time (multiple batches), particularly if preparing multiple dishes. (I don't know a lot about these kinds of appliances -- don't know whether it's possible to get a bigger basket for more money; but my guess is that what makes this process feasible is a small unit ... relative to, for example, to the size of an oven.)\n\nFinally, the timer is a bit funky. It's spring-loaded and analog, and a bit wonky to set precisely. Again, I rate that a minor issue -- particularly because (unlike a microwave, for example) an extra minute or two isn't going take the food from good to inedible (won't get too dry or chewy).\n\nWhat I think is best about it: I do like fried foods (fries, cheese sticks, battered veggies, battered chicken and fish), but I HATE frying at home, because the house smells fried for three days (not to mention it's dangerous to have six inches of 400-degree oil atop the range); ... and baking / microwaving frozen pre-fried food is a sad substitute for food that's actually fried ... freshly. There's no good way (with standard kitchen appliances) to have good deep-fried food at home. THIS machine addresses that problem. That's what makes it worth having -- finally, o can have quality \"fried\" food at home ... safely and without smelling the oil for the three subsequent days.\n\nMore expensive units might be better, but this thing is pretty great ... within the limitations noted here ... and perfect for a nice side of fries! I'd give it 4.5 out of 5, if I could. Given the rating limitations and the price, I lean slightly-closer to 5 than 4."},{"reviewerName":"Stuff Yer Face","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"One Potato, two Potaoes....","reviewDate":"May 21, 2017","reviewText":"On the fence about which AF to get? I went with the 1500 Watt Secura because it seemed like $229 was insane to pay for a gadget. I'm so glad I got this. I actually use it EVERY day, often 3x a day. You'll be looking around your place going, \"I can air fry that!!\"\n\nThis guy sits on my counter. I like leaving room around it for the hot air to blow. This is Florida and as soon as I turn on my oven, the house heats up. Since buying my Secura, I don't think I've tuned my regular oven on at all.\n\nCleanup is awesome.\n\nI'm happy to cook with oil but using this, there's no need. I can add a bit towards the end to flavor and get it extra extra tasty. My favorite af thing aside from potatoes has to be air fried green beans.\n\nSecret tips: shake EVERYTHING\nCrowding the basket is for amateurs\nKeep a pair of silicone coated tongs nearby to flip stuff\nIf you leave food inside the closed unit the basket too long it steams and doesn't stay crisp so take it out once it's done.\n\nThe only tiny downside? There's no actual power button it's just the timer knob, so you have to drag it back to zero if you are taking stuff out early, which you will because it's kind of guesswork knowing the time and temp. Also the temp knob is hard to read.\n\nI'm in love with this thing!!!"},{"reviewerName":"Texas Breeze","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Classy design","reviewDate":"January 1, 2017","reviewText":"This air fryer is very quiet compared to others.

But I wouldn't buy this JUST to cook fries it. You can cook pretty much ANYTHING in here and it's so EASY. I put my bread in here for toasting...turn the timer to 3-4 minutes and it comes out perfect. I like that I can go sit down in the living room and wait for the \"DING\" of the bell that goes off when it's ready. And if I am busy when it's ready, I can leave whatever I'm cooking in there and it won't get cold and it won't overcook......just stays warm.\n\nSo what have I cooked in there? Seems like every breakfast, lunch and dinner I use it. Toast, baked potatoes, french fries, onion rings (my batter recipe needs work as these have not turned out that great ha!). I'm a vegetarian, so I've cooked veggie burgers, veggie bacon, tofu, and all kinds of wonderful Gardein fried unchick'n, unfish, etc. in here. PIzza! You can't fit a whole pizza but you can fit a slice or a small rectangular pie.\n\nThe best way to think of it is that everything you can cook in your oven, you can cook in here much easier and faster. And the food comes out crispier. Same with the toaster--this is better. Most things that you deep fry can be cooked in there. Many things that you pan fry can be cooked in here. And it's so easy.\n\nThe Secura seems like an awesome machine. I have not tried other brands but I have to say that I have no problems at all with the Secura AND it seems very intuitive and easy to use. Also, the 4 liter capacity seems important....the more you cook with it the more you want to cook with it. For two people I think you need close to the full 4 liters. Also, the drawer and tray go in the dishwasher--that is key, although they are easy to wash out in the sink if need be as they are non stick.\n\nI highly recommend this unit. For plus or minus a hundred bucks, it will bring you plenty of cooking joy, and save you a lot of time."},{"reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"It's good, but it's not a deep fryer and gives different results","reviewDate":"February 28, 2018","reviewText":"I've only had this a couple of weeks. It's OK, but it is NOT a deep fryer and does not give the same results. It is an air fryer. You use much less oil in the cooking process. This saves calories and your arteries.\nWhat I've cooked so far:\nHome made french fries. Used about 3 tbs of oil. Turned out pretty good, not crunchy enough for my taste.\nOnion Rings: Used 2 tbs oil. I followed the instructions and had rocks, barely edible.\nGrilled Cheese: Spray butter. A little dry, but absolutely wonderful. Crispy on the outside, oowey-gooey on the inside.\nFish Sticks: Spray oil (a little on each side). Great, crispy on the outside moist and tender on the inside.\nI wish there were more recipes available either in the booklet or on line for this particular Air Fryer. This is the biggest thing missing. I know there are a ton of recipe books, but it would have been nice to have more available from the manufacturer.\nWhile I recommend this product, do NOT expect to have the same results as deep frying."},{"reviewerName":"Tesca","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Received a few days ago, finally had time to ...","reviewDate":"May 15, 2018","reviewText":"Received a few days ago, finally had time to unbox and wash components last night.

Not yet ready for such an expenditure so, I thought I'd try this in the meantime. It surprises me that it's doing a better job on frozen foods....clam strips, tater tots, fish fillets---it crisps better, bagels too. Thought I'd give Bibigo pot stickers a try....put a little water in the basket and sprayed them with oil a few times....Were they as good as pan fried? Damn close and no grease to be found anywhere on my counter.....love it!! Though 4.2 Qt is as small as I'd go. I am very impressed with the reliability of the Secura brand. I have two of their induction cooktops (one over 6 years old) and a Secura Electric kettle that I love and use daily. That reliability weighed heavily in my decision.

It is so easy to clean, cooks very fast and the food is so good, I put my oil fryer out in the garage. Just as a note, the metal basket does come out of the pan. The button that releases the pan from the air fryer, has another button closer to the handle that releases the basket. Well built. Had mine about a few weeks now. Will post addendums if something goes wrong, but so far extremely happy and the seller is very supportive with follow up emails letting me know if I have any problems, they want to make it right. 5 star business.\nOne thing I would note: BE CAREFUL when pressing the release button for the pan, and don't even think about moving this unit without the pan securely locked in place. The pan is released at a slightly downward angle, so gravity can assist it coming out, but you have to be aware that it can slide all the way out once released. Just a heads up."},{"reviewerName":"P.

I chose it in part because of it's larger capacity. I also like that it is square rather than round.\nI have been using it for about a month and have not been disappointed with anything I have made.\nI have made: chicken tenders, zuccinni, asparagus, home fries, fish, shrimp, turkey bacon, meatballs, stuffed mushrooms, sweet potoato fries, chicken breasts, chicken wings, corn dogs and frozen french fries.\nIt cleans very easily and I love that the mess is contained to a small space (instead of wiping bacon grease off my cooktop).\nAs some other reviewers have said, calling any of these machines \"fryers\" is really a misnomer. They are basically mini-convection ovens.

As instructed, I shook the basket a couple of times to ensure the shrimp and scallops cooked evenly.

I'm type ll diabetic and this method of cooking allows me to enjoy some foods that are normally cooked with a lot of cooking oil, that is not needed with the air fryer. For those of you who like to cook with oil, it does state that you can brush on or apply a small amount of oil if you desire. Those McDonald type hash browns come out really nice in this unit, plus it's pretty fast. The thing I always hate is the clean up after use, and let me tell you this is a breeze to clean after using it as all surfaces including the drip pan are teflon coated.

I expected a \"hot air\" cooker to cook with hot air. This one doesn't. Probably none of these similar devices do. It is essentially an enclosed toaster oven/broiler with a small fan mounted behind the heating element. The heating element is still directly above the food being cooked, or I should say, directly above the top layer of the food being cooked. I thought maybe I was missing a baffle or something but nope, this is the way it is. (See picture). So it chars the food on top and slightly cooks the rest.\n\nIn the second picture, you'll see our first attempt using this. Followed the directions, Fries, 700 grams (less than the maximum recommended amount of 800, above the optimum amount 500). Includes a light coating of oil to make them crispy as recommended in the direcctions. Halfway through I stirred as recommended. I wish I would have taken a picture of that - the top layer was completely charred before I stirred. After stirring the first time, I stirred every 5 minutes. The picture is actually after I had removed the worst charred fries (before I thought to take a picture). The fries did not taste good.\n\nThen I tried just one potato, no oil, stirring every few minutes for about 12 minutes.

Results were very good. Next up will be a whole small chicken (will see how that works out). Have not tried the skewers and elevated rack yet. Had to order a 7\" cake pan to try that feature out (would have been nice if it were included with the product). Size fits the mid range between the 3.2 and 5.3. Price was reasonable but wish it had the digital readouts instead of the manual. Quality appears to be excellent. Warranty exceeds that of the competition. Can't figure out why there are not more reviews/ratings for the product on youtube and the net and why it does not show up in top ten ratings. But, so far, I'm satisfied!!"},{"reviewerName":"Cindy Borgne","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Good Dependable Air Fryer.","reviewDate":"September 4, 2017","reviewText":"It's easy to use. All you need to know is the temperature and how long to cook it. Then use the dials. If it's not done, it's easy to just close the drawer and keep cooking it. The drawer goes in and out easily and cleaning is simple too as the drawer and basket can go in the dishwasher. I haven't had any sticking problems. It comes with some recipes. Some things take longer to cook than what they say, and you do have to turn or shake certain items, which does seem a bit inconvenient, however, I think it's worth it since you are avoiding a lot of grease. I trust the Secura brand as I also a have a pressure cooker by them that has been reliable as well."},{"reviewerName":"Roshcal","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Forms rust on bottom plate over time!","reviewDate":"June 17, 2019","reviewText":"When I got this a few months ago, I was happy with the purchase and got quite used to air frying most foods. After using it for few months, I noted the bottom of the inner housing (refer to pics) started to form rust. Unfortunately the bottom plate is not made of rust-resistant material. I believe this unit has a flaw where there is a bit of moisture being formed when cooking. I also have the smaller digital version of Secura 3.4 Qt air fryer and it has a aluminum bottom plate and does not have the rust issue this one is having. I prefer a square basket as it can hold more items than a circular one. Due to the rust formed, I no longer use this fryer as it can have an impact on your cooking and can have a negative result on your health. As such, I do not recommend this fryer to anyone."},{"reviewerName":"Beverly","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Very happy!!!","reviewDate":"September 1, 2018","reviewText":"I looked at a lot of makes and models of air fryers before I bought this one.

Havent had any need for the accessories, but they look good sitting on the counter. it doesn't heat as high (wont do more than 390) as our deep fry, so we are experimenting with timing, and you cant set it for just a minute or two if an item needs a bit more time."},{"reviewerName":"RSULL","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"My favorite new appliance!","reviewDate":"May 28, 2018","reviewText":"Love this thing!

I read that with all the heat, it was better to get a dial unit than a digital since the digital didn’t tolerate the heat as well and using this couldn’t be easier.

Since my fryer just came a couple of days ago and I don't have any potatoes and since I had some left over beef and cabbage I decided to try piroshki. I was so pleased with the results I had to take a picture. I followed a regular recipe and cooked the piroshki (4 at a time) on 10 minutes each side at 230 and finished off 5 or 6 minutes at 360. They came out great tender on the inside and crispy on the outside. The best parts are not having to heat my oven or make a mess frying and also that I could easily change the temperature from a low heat for baking to a high heat for browning.

Check out recipes online, there are so many options like cooking a steak on the pan and your appetizers on the rack and they all come out crisp and delicious without all the added fatty oils quick and easy.

The prior reviews made me pull the trigger and order this. I was looking for healthier alternative to frying. This thing is great. Some of the best non-fried chicken breasts I've done that were not grilled perfectly. I used cajun spices on the first couple of chicken breasts I cooked, one with O'Brien potatoes (cubed, and added garden peppers half way through when I turned the chicken and shook the potatoes. Chicken had great appearance, juicy but done inside. Potatoes were excellent too. It was a breeze to clean up, just dish soap, bit of brushing, and rinse. Both the drawer/grill/grid part that sits inside the drain drawer, both cleaned easily. Dry with towel and use damp towel on inside of unit to keep it clean, and you're done. Has a big footprint and tall to the point it may test low hung cabinets that hang over the counter area. I just unplug my unit and store it in another adjacent room. I think it would do three large chicken breasts at a time, but I've only done two at a time so far. But one breast and a batch of potatoes made a perfect, one-person meal. Could easily have fed two, as the breast was 10 oz or more. Double batch of potatoes. If I was regularly cooking for two/three or more, I might get a larger unit. Set it for 360 degrees, 15 minutes, done. Great gear I plan to use often. Edit: I've now cooked a pound of Salmon, after quartering the fresh Salmon. Misted with olive oil, seasoned. 12 minutes at 350 degree setting. Perfect. I usually smoke my Salmon, which takes hours with seasoning, and low cooking temperatures. I also froze another pound of Salmon at the same time, then pan thawed it in water, but it was more 'fishy' than the first pound cooked when fresh. Also cooked 3 large, skinless chicken breasts in it, 20 minutes, done.

It's awesome for any kind of potato, whether you want to make frozen fries or use fresh potatoes. It's way faster than a toaster oven and makes them really crispy. I've also used it for homemade chicken breast tenders and it worked great. It's also my new favorite way to make bacon. The whole thing is very easy to clean as well."},{"reviewerName":"LadyDi","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"My only mistake is that I should have purchased it sooner!","reviewDate":"April 2, 2018","reviewText":"This air fryer exceeded all of my expectations.

I use it almost everyday. I have cooked a pork roast in 20 minutes with small potatoes on the side and it was delicious. I have made cauliflower \"steaks\" that were perfect. Even hot dogs or frozen pretzels can be cooked up in this beauty. Buy it! The model I have is large enough for several servings but even a small one would be useful!"},{"reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"BUY THIS ONE","reviewDate":"December 5, 2018","reviewText":"Bang for the buck, you cannot beat this unit. I have friends that went for the bells and whistles, digital & pushbutton models, but the important thing is the 1500 watts. Like others have said, shaking the basket or turning your food every 5 - 15 minutes depending on what is being prepared makes for even golden brown cooking. Very simple to use and time / temp settings both become intuitive after the first few uses. Start with fries and nuggets to get the feel for the settings and you are on your way to steaks and seafood."},{"reviewerName":"Marti Vincze","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Quick and healthy","reviewDate":"August 6, 2018","reviewText":"I use this gem almost every week.

This one was the winner! Our favorite features include: Extra Large size, price, and non-beeping/non-digital model. We love just turning the knob to turn it on. It's SO FAST. The other models require all this button pushing with loud beeps to set the temp and time and then they beep like crazy when done... wakes up the whole house. This model makes no beeping noises except when it's done, it beeps ONCE. Perfect. And it cooks FAST and can accommodate my rectangular pyrex dishes right from the fridge.

No worries about THIS model; it uses your ordinary kitchen electrical outlets. I have not had enough opportunity to explore the device's versatility but it pays for itself in my eyes just by how well it delivers \"fried\" potatoes without fat. Chunks of potato or sweet potato prepared in the air fryer are excellent. You may rub a little oil on the potatoes but it isn't necessary.\n\nClean-up -- always an issue with countertop / specialized appliances -- is a snap. The cooking basket dissembles for cleaning with the push of one button. The cooking area is a particularly tough and effective nonstick surface. A breeze to wash.\n\nBear in mind that the cooking capacity is not large -- enough to \"fry up\" four or five potatoes.\n\nI love it!"},{"reviewerName":"JAN COLBERT","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Nice","reviewDate":"January 17, 2019","reviewText":"Hope it works"},{"reviewerName":"drew robichaux","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Good quality","reviewDate":"October 18, 2018","reviewText":"Good little air fryer for one person.

I purchased an extended warranty plan when I ordered the air fryer because that is my rule of thumb when I make a purchase that nears the $100 mark. I have to say that it is made so well that I probably wasted the extra money, but not a big deal.\nI've wanted to own one of these for some time and finally made the decision to purchase one. Purely by coincidence the week after it arrived my husband was diagnosed with Diabetes 2 and there are some drastic changes taking place in our meal preparations. I've made a number of entrees using it and have not been disappointed at all! I was expecting to possibly ruin something in my initial attempts since it is a completely different cooking concept but everything so far has been delicious. I golf twice a week with a gal who has one, and she's been cheering me on with new ideas. She loves her's too!! I've made seafood, garlic bread, sweet potatoes, stuffed mushrooms, and more,all from scratch!!! I feel like life in the kitchen has been reborn! And clean up is a cinch.

In other words, this unit can hold content in a \"square\" 4.1 L liter size. To compare, draw a circle inside that square, and THAT'S the capacity/shape/size of others.

So far, I've made fries, onion rings, shrimp, burgers, egg rolls, etc. Things that are meant to be fried come out great. Was a little leery of doing burgers, but, both hamburg and chicken burgers came out great. I used a little spray for chicken burger so it wouldn't be too dry. Came out crispy on outside and tender inside. The manual comes with a chart for what temps to put everything on and it covers quite a bit. I've found that the times sometimes need to be adjusted though. Just get a meat thermometer to test everything before you eat. There's always a learning curve with new appliances and this is no exception. I would give this a 4 1/2 stars, but, you can't do half a star on here.\nA little tip: use a small piece of tin foil in bottom of basket to help cut down on cleanup...huge time saver! Don't let it go up the sides though or it will interfere with airflow that cooks your food. If you're looking for something small for 1 or 2 people, this isn't it. It's pretty big on your counter. Bigger than a toaster & smaller than a microwave, if that helps.\nWill be trying roasting and baking next and will update when I do.

It works as described by many reviewers. Pretty much anything you can cook in a conventional oven, you can air fry.\n\nOnly concern. It has a small, push button micro switch that engages when you push the pan into the fryer. (It must be some sort of interlock??) Unfortunately, the micro switch is rather flimsy so I often have to push it in several times to get it to engage. I'd give it 5 stars if it wasn't for this issue."},{"reviewerName":"Barbara M.
