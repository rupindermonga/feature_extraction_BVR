Decision was about counters-pace vs basket size. The ninja takes up slightly less space than the stand mixer. It's lightweight and easy to pull out from under the cabinet to use (to allow for air flow). I like it so much, I wish for a bigger one just to do my entire meal in it at once. For two people, it does a fair amount of wings or tater tots, or the sweet potato fries pictured here. I used the reheat function and the bang bang shrimp came out quite tasty. Steaks came out moist and medium rare, but not seared even on the crisper plate. It has worked well with salmon and chicken breasts. So much easier to clean than a pan and my stove top. It cooked those breaded chicken rounds, fish, and tater tots and in about 10 minutes. Much less time than a toaster oven. The Ninja does not come with added attachments for the grilling or baking as the Phillips, but it's $200 less. Nuff said."},{"reviewerName":"Lunch","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Horrible Burning Plastic Smell!","reviewDate":"July 24, 2019","reviewText":"I unboxed this a few days ago and followed the instructions for cleaning the basket and crisping tray with hot soapy water. I’ve used five times since and each time it has filled my home with a horrible smell of burning plastic. It doesn’t look like any of the plastic parts are melting, but if you sniff the basket after cooking something the plastic smell is much stronger. I think whatever non-stick coating they use on the basket is releasing the toxic smell when heated. Really don’t think it is ceramic as they claim. Kind of a bummer since it does seem to cook food very well. I would say get this if you don’t mind having a headache from breathing fumes along with every meal."},{"reviewerName":"xueapple","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Had to return it due to the strong toxic plastic/rubber smell","reviewDate":"January 10, 2019","reviewText":"I believe the smell was coming from the plastic handle of the basket and it got worse after I pre-heated as the instruction suggested. There are three rubber knots on the inside plate which they strongly recommend you to put it there when air frying. That was surprising to me as there is no information saying it is safe to heat it up. Another problem was the misalignment of the basket outsider. Overall, I was very disappointed and upset about this air fryer. Not sure if I ever want to get one in the future."},{"reviewerName":"Jesse Baynard","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"I LOVE IT, Perfect for meals for 1 or 2","reviewDate":"October 18, 2018","reviewText":"I try not to eat fried food and I never thought I was missing out by not having a deep fryer, so an air fryer just seemed replacement that I didn't need. So I was skeptical about how much I would use this... maybe a few frozen tater tots or fries for the kids. But oh my goodness I want to use this for everything. I like to think of this as a personal sized convection oven on steroids. Veggie burgers crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. Roasted vegetables, fish sticks, chicken, burgers, fries, fish all with about 30-40% shorter cook times than the oven and only a 3 minute preheat time (vs 6-10 oven minutes).\n\nThis would be perfect for dorms or couples who want to eat something other than microwaved mush. It's also perfect for families who want a better way to make \"fried\" sides like fries, mozzarella sticks, or chicken strips. The clean up is so much easier than cookie sheets. The tub and the browning air fry tray both have a very nice non stick coating making cleanup as simple as a rinse and a wipe.\n\nSo cons... hmm that's a hard one. The biggest cons are that you may want to get a few extra kitchen tools like silicon tipped tongs to toss or flip your food and maybe a small 7\" pan for baking if you like the idea of making this your primary oven too. Also you will need to get a feel for how much faster this cooks so you don't overcook your food, but checking on the food is easy and just a peak away. Once you get your timing right setting the controls is super easy and the timer turns it off automatically and you don't have to worry about a lot of carry over heat like you do in an oven.\n\nOVERALL... I highly recommend it, the Ninja controls are just as simple and intuitive on this as it is on my Ninja blender, it super easy to clean, and it cooks nearly everything fabulously."},{"reviewerName":"C. Martin","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Best appliance since the microwave!!!","reviewDate":"January 13, 2019","reviewText":"Been having this fryer for 2 weeks now and it has NOT rested yet. I LOVE IT & wonder how I've gone this long w/out one. Before I start bragging on this thing, I am by no way endorsed by Ninja or getting paid by them. I've owned a few Ninja products blenders and still have one that's over 10 years old. They make quality machines. This fryer is a life & time saver...especially if you're a lazy cook. I have been researching air fryers for the past few months and nothing comes close to the Ninja. The basket size isn't the large 5+ quart capacity like the bigger fryers, (Ninja is only 4qt), but this thing cooks so fast you won't miss the extra 1 qt. It comes w/ a crisper that works perfectly, a recipe book and a multi-layer rack. The first night I had it I made wings and I tell you that I will NEVER buy fried chicken again!!! Yes, they were that crispy and tasted much better. I bought the Louisiana fried chicken flour from Walmart, battered the wings, spritzed w/ a little olive oil and had fried chicken in 10 minutes. No greasy mess, no 3rd degree burns from hot oil, and your house doesn't smell like a chicken joint for 4 days afterward. Because the Ninja uses a ceramic coating on their fryers the clean up is very easy. Next, I made sweet potato fries! Had a bag of frozen ones in the freezer and popped those babies in for 10 min. They were crispier than McDonald's. I tried homemade fries but the procedure takes too long. You have to peel, slice, soak potatoes, dry them...I'm just ready to pop them in the fryer and eat! It has been nonstop air fryer cooking in this house! I hit youtube to get a few recipes and it's been on ever since. What I like best about this fryer is it has a dehydrator feature and how fast it cooks. Frozen chicken wings? No problem! Throw them in the fryer for 10 minutes and they're defrosted. I've cooked pizza, fries, wings, reheated food, fried zucchini, and tonight I baked a chocolate cake. Everything came out perfect! Next up is donuts! The only thing I don't like about this fryer is 30 seconds after it finishes cooking it shuts off. I know this is a safety feature but I always have more items to cook. In 2 weeks, I have used my microwave twice, and that was to reheat coffee. Before I forget, I did cinnamon rolls too! I used the canned Pillsbury ones and it normally takes 20 min in the oven. In the Ninja? 8 minutes and that's if you like them brown. I actually could have stopped it at 5 min and they would be perfect. My house smelled like a Cinnabon factory!😛 I have used every feature on this fryer except the dehydrator but I'll be making beef jerky soon. Overall, I am VERY pleased! The best selling feature was the price & the size. The Ninja is much slimmer than some of the bulkier fryers and fits under my cabinet nicely. I'm also happy it only used 1500W unlike some of the larger fryers that burn 1800 which could kill your light bill. The outside of the fryer doesn't get hot so you won't have to worry about getting burned but do take caution when taking your food out. Is it loud? My exhaust fan on my stove is louder than the Ninja. The extension cord on it is long so you don't have to worry about being limited on where you can place it. I think I've covered everything? This thing is THE BOMB! If you're wondering what cookware you can use, just about anything you place in a microwave you can put in the Ninja. I went to the Dollar Tree and bought a few 7\" foil pans I use to reheat food & bake in. Also, grab you some silicone tongs while you're there so you don't scratch the surface of your fryer. This thing has been almost as good as a kid getting a new bike for Christmas. You will NOT be disappointed w/ this purchase. Happy & healthy cooking!"},{"reviewerName":"S.

Hopefully they will make at least a 5.6 qt one soon and I will be buying it as soon as they do.

I was really pleasantly surprised! I do a lot of cooking, but also work a full time job, which means I have little time to make dishes that really impress me. In nearly every way, this fryer has upended that reality and changed my life!\n\nIt has adjustable temperature and time settings which accommodate pretty much any kind of cooking you would do - dehydrating, reheating, roasting, and frying. I hardly ever use my stove or oven anymore, because using this Ninja air fryer is so much quicker and more efficient. And there are fewer dishes to be cleaned when it's all over! Since it heats things with air, I use so much less oil in my cooking. The food does taste a bit *healthier* than it used to, but that's pretty much a necessary tradeoff when you're trying to eat better.\n\nI love how big the bottom basket is, and I'm able to fit two pounds of tofu and some veggies in there without having it spill over the top or cook unevenly. The machine is really sleek and the parts are all easy to wash, ensuring that you'll return to use it time and time again. My only complaint is that the unit is pretty loud (kind of like a dehydrator), so best to do all your air frying before guests arrive for a holiday party.\n\n10/10 would recommend!"},{"reviewerName":"Art Vandelay","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Simple to use, nice to look at, efficient cooking","reviewDate":"February 26, 2019","reviewText":"But why only four stars? Because what others have posted about this air fryer is true - when you first use it, it stinks. (sigh) Yes. I read the instructions before even unboxing it all the way. Yes. I thoroughly washed the basket and all associated components with warm, soapy water before using. I ran an initial burn-in (no pun intended) for ten minutes at 390 degrees, and the unit produced a noticeable plastic/chemical burn-off smell that filled the room. When I leaned close to the machine and sniffed, the smell was too acrid to take.\n\nBut why four stars if it stinks? It's a great air fryer. It doesn't continue to stink. After the components are burned in and the (whatever that stuff is) burns off, it's a really good five-star cooker. The controls are very simple. I cooked several things that turned out really well. Crispy flounder filets, popcorn shrimp, chicken patties...all crispy, hot, and ready in ten minutes. And no plastic smell on the food.\nIf you're cooking for one or two people and you don't really want to fire up the big oven and wait for it to reach cooking temp, this is just the thing for you. If you don't want to deal with oil splattering out of a frying pan, this is just the thing for you.\nHowever...\nIf you get one of these, wash the components according to the instructions. Take it out to your garage or on your patio/porch to fire it up for the first time. Run it for about 20 minutes at 390 degrees. After that, it should be good to go. I would humbly suggest doing this no matter what brand of air fryer you select, because anything that has a heating element new from the factory will outgas a certain amount when initially turned on.\nHope this helps."},{"reviewerName":"Alliecatkatie","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Easy, fast and convenient!","reviewDate":"November 4, 2018","reviewText":"So far love it and more importantly my husband does.

The price is very reasonable for an air fryer, I was not going to pay a couple hundred dollars or more, also I did not need a large capacity air fryer as I am cooking for myself. I decided to make air fried chicken wings, I followed all directions prior to air frying the chicken, there was just a little bit of plastic smell upon warm up. I set the timer for the 1st batch of chicken for 25mins. recommended 21-26 mins. The chicken was actually done in about 20 min. This Ninja air fryer cooks food quick, and was probably the crunchiest chicken I have had and juicy too, the second batch of wings took a little less than 20 min., The 3rd batch of chicken was just chicken legs and seasoned only, no fry coating. It took about 18 - 20 min., and was some of the tastiest chicken I have had. I am very impressed with the Ninja air fryer. Clean up was simple warm soapy water rinse, and dry nothing stuck to any parts as for I did use vegetable spray in the basket and the heating tray and rack.

They make frying food so much easier. The tots come out super crispy and evenly cooked, check strips are juicy in the middle and crispy on the outside. When I used an oven I could never get tots to be crispy, they would always be soggy or some were crispy while others were not, no longer an issue.\n\nI originally had a Philips HD9220/28 Viva Airfryer but had to return it after using for a short while. It was hard to clean as the basket would just get grease a stuck in it, the first one I had rusted the second one started to get scratched in the back of the pan from the basket getting removed and added to the pan. Overall it felt that it was made with super cheap parts. While it cooked the food well, the quality was crap.\n\nThe Ninja, on the other hand, seems to be well made. the tray in the inside of the pan slides in and out of the pan easily and since it is a flat surface instead of a basket makes it super easy to clean in comparison. I love that you can easily pause the timer and that there is a power button. This way I can keep the device plugged in and pause the timer as I remove the basket to shake the food to make sure it cooks evenly then restart it when I put the tray back. The design is not perfect, as the tray doesn't match up perfectly with the device, so it isn't completely flushed to the device, but that is a minor aesthetic. Just like the Philips, the device smells horrible when you first start it up. However, after a few uses, the smell completely goes away. The digital display makes it easy to set the temperature and timer. The cookbook it comes with is thin but has some good recipes and the additional wire tray is a nice addition to the device. I highly recommend the Ninja as the quality is great of the parts, it is easy to clean, and the food cooks perfectly as long as you follow the instructions. So far this is the best Air Fryer I have used and it is super affordable.\n\nIf I notice any issues in the next few months as I use the device I will update the review."},{"reviewerName":"Shanda Macomber","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"excellent buy","reviewDate":"December 18, 2018","reviewText":"This is a must have for those looking for a healthier life with cooking.

After reading a bunch about the health advantages, I was mostly sold on at least giving one a try, and then when I started to think about how I seldom actually deep fry anything because of the mess and cleanup work, I figured even if an airfryer gave me half the quality, it might be worthwhile.\n\nThe Ninja unit couldn't be easier to assemble and setup. Unbox it, wash a few parts and you're ready to go...doubt it would take more than 10 minutes for most people to go from UPS delivering the box to frying some fries. The unit is a bit of an awkward size - it sits fine on my counters, but it's not that easy to find a place to store it. Luckily, I have a nearly empty shelf in my pantry...otherwise, I would have been in for a little shelf reconfiguration.\n\nIn operation, it's somewhat noisy, but not much more than my full-size microwave oven, and probably less than my large range hood on one of the higher settings. It heats quickly without the outside parts getting too hot to touch, and that's important to me, especially in the hot summer months where the last thing I want is another appliance pumping more heat into my kitchen.\n\nThe food drawer/tray is a little smaller than I expected. Two medium/large potatoes cut into fries pretty much fill it, as do about 6-8 chicken tenderloin strips. The good news is that it cooks quickly, so it's not too bad if you need to split your food up into multiple batches.\n\nI found if you shake or turn your food often (as the instructions recommend), then food generally cooks evenly. Yes, it gets crispy, but no, I don't think you'd confuse what comes out of the machine with true deep fried food. Still, it's definitely healthier, and certainly a lot faster and easier to cleanup.\n\nI suppose if you're looking for an airfryer, this is a good unit to try. It's not super expensive, and it definitely gets the job done about as well as the others I've heard about. Definitely worth a look if you're shopping for a nice air fryer at a fair price."},{"reviewerName":"Tana","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Dont buy","reviewDate":"April 2, 2019","reviewText":"This is not a good airfyer.

My current set is well over 15 years old and just now starting to show deterioration of the coating. I think more from metal utensils being used occasionally (by an unknown person or persons!) than anything else. So when I read the reviews on other brands and saw where the coating was breaking down after a short period of time, I kept looking. NINJA AIR FRYER....I am quite pleased with the Ninja Air Fryer--I like that it has a digital display and is easy for me to read (I'm 74), that it has a pause button, the crisper tray is a bonus and works as intended, and it just looks good sitting on my counter. Its has 4 functions--air frying, roasting, reheating and dehydrating. First, of course, I fixed tater tots and french fries; last week I fixed a small roast and a baked potato, and this week I tried boneless, skinless chicken breasts (with and without shake and bake coating), and boneless pork chops (brushed with olive oil only). All came out looking good and very edible. There is learning curve involved with any new appliance, so I have made notes as I try each item. As with any new appliance, the more you use it, the more ways you will think to use it. The ceramic coated basket was a major selling point, and I let it cool before soaking. I use a soft rag mop-type brush (no bristles) to clean it, and it does the job. No scrubbing needed. I never have put my pots and pans in the dishwasher regardless what the manufacturer says. Today, I am going to try to bake cornbread using the small loaf pans I had purchased for my toaster oven. Tomorrow, muffins in silicone baking cups! This is probably a larger size air fryer than I needed for one person; however, I decided I'd rather have one too big than too small--plus it will be used when I have company. Money well spent! UPDATE: Another important consideration was that the basket was ROUND--8.5\" diameter--unlike many other air fryer brands. All accessories (cake pan, pizza pan, etc.) and the parchment liners I looked at and ultimately purchased were 7+\" and \"round.\" Plenty of room for air circulation and easy to add to and remove from basket. Plus many of my existing oven baking dishes and pans will also work.

So just get that myth out of your head. I have no clue what the hell all these reviewers are talking about. \"Omg best French fries ever\" \" it taste just like fried food!\". All lies! It in no way taste fried. It's basically an adult easy bake oven. Does it make food a lil crispies than the oven, maybe. But if u cooked something in a convection oven or this, the taste would basically be the same. Now the only perk about this, is that it cuts your cook time exponentially. Instead of cooking something in the oven for 20min, you can cook it under 10min. So if u beed to save time or save money on your electric bill, viola. Maybe you wanna go camping but cant, obviously, bring your oven. Then this works great. Aside from that, its absolutely useless and just something that takes up space. Also, I tried the gowise that everyone raves about. It's the same results but the ninja build quality is far better. As a machine it looks like its built to last and well put together. So I'd choose this over the gowise. But if you really need a new toy, then get the ninjafoodi.

The problem I have is there is a horrid smell which I have been trying to diagnose. The crisper plate has rubber? feet on it which I thought was the issue. I took out the plate and used the metal rack only, and there was still a smell, albeit much less. I've used the air fryer several more times with the crisper plate since I thought it was coming from somewhere else, resulting in the same horrid smell. At this point I'm convinced it is mostly the crisper plate's rubber feet which I took off. I just cooked something that didn't take much time and the smell seemed much better. More experimenting is needed, but I want to love this because it works well and is easy to clean, but that smell can clear a room, very toxic and not something I want in my food!\nUpdate (about 1 month later): Have been using air fryer, took feet off the inside tray. Sometimes does not smell too bad sometimes still smells awful. I notice the awful smell is usually when cooking bacon - a lot of grease drips down. I think it's the grease contacting the ceramic coating (if it is just ceramic?). Ceramic shouldn't smell that bad but the smell is toxic and awful. Will be returning, too bad because otherwise the product is great. They need to use less toxic materials."},{"reviewerName":"Benjamin M","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Ehrmagawd.","reviewDate":"March 9, 2019","reviewText":"Where have you been all my life, air fryer!\n\nI was skeptical at first.

Just a sprits if olive oil spray and boom! Perfect shrimp. Same thing for fries, wings, and onion rings. We then scored a recipe book on air frying (thank you Amazon) and now we do so many different things you’d be amazed - I have to say over a third of the things we used to bake or fry are now done in the air fryer. Probably closer to 50%. My only complaint? Size - to get the most value you need at least a midsize fryer - go with something too small and you will regret it. Our ninja is the perfect size - but it is also large so be ready to clean out a cabinet to hold this guy. You can be lazy and just keep it on your counter but it looks out of place in our kitchen - perhaps if you sell your oven you would have a nice spot for your ninja! Just kidding folks lol!

I researched a lot of air fryers. The weird part was everyone I know has different brands and they’re all happy with them. I went with Ninja because I have the Bullet, that is used daily, and it is reliable.\n\nThe size is similar to an Instant Pot. It runs relatively quietly. Think of the fan on a computer. It’s noticeable, but not distracting. When it comes to cleaning, it’s super easy. Other than the tiny bar on the in the middle of the elevation tray, it’s non-stick. The controls are simple and button presses require very little force to register\n\nMy only complaint (same for most air fryers) is the horizontal space. Yes, you can pour 2 pounds of fries inside, but you can’t lay two burger patties without them over lapping. I end up cooking them until they shrink a bit then adjust if needed before continuing.\n\nOverall the Ninja is a solid choice. I’ve used it at least once or twice a week with no issues.

I didn't raise a fuss, but I did keep it till the end of my return period, using it frequently, learning how to use an air fryer on it because I'd paid for the privilege."},{"reviewerName":"E.

Smoked my house so bad thought I was going to have to call the fire dept. Not sure what that was about but I kept trying it since it has so many good reviews & I have ended up liking it alot. It's not as great as my 1st no-name brand air fryer but it's still fine. I've noticed I must cook a lot of items on a much lower temp than my last fryer & I have to put water in the bottom for anything very greasy like bacon or hamburger to control the smoke. I do wish that it would pause the cooking automatically when I open it to shake but I have gotten used to pausing it myself. Also wish it had a shake reminder alarm on it like a couple other fryers I have seen. I love it's ceramic; feel like it's safer to use than the Teflon's. Had to get use to some of the temps not being there; for ex goes from 375 straight to 390, nothing in between. There are a few temp levels like that. Is it the best air fryer out there? To me, no, but overall, it's not a bad fryer and I feel you will like it."},{"reviewerName":"Keith R.","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"We love it.","reviewDate":"December 6, 2018","reviewText":"I took the plunge.

Amazing fryer!","reviewDate":"August 20, 2019","reviewText":"THE SHORT AND SWEET VERSION\n- So easy to use... you can probably not read the manual and be a pro at it. Buttons are self-explanatory\n- Booklet is an amazing guide - do not throw it out. Follow it closely and it'll almost guarantee your food will come out perfect each time.\n\nTHE LONG-WINDED VERSION\nI've heard so much about air fryers but never actually went and got one. Well, my GF finally convinced me to get one (and it was also on sale so that helped) and I haven't looked back. First, it's super easy to use. The buttons are self explanatory. The instruction guide/booklet is even better (don't throw it away!) since it tells you what you can cook with it, what temperature, and time to use. I don't follow it exactly but very close to it. I love how it has a timer so I know it'll stop automatically when it's finished.\n\nWATCH OUTS: the only watch-out, and it's probably standard, is that it blows out how air through the vents in the back. Make sure that the back of the air fryer is not against anything and that there's a lot of space/open air around it."},{"reviewerName":"A.

Something simple just to see how it worked. The cooking went well. It was the washing up where some issues arose. First, I noticed a scratch in the non-stick surface. It isn't terribly large, but shouldn't be there, and what is going to happen in the future if it came with a scratch? Rust? Peeling? Secondly, that silver bar in the center is NOT non-stick, and the food absolutely does get stuck under and around the ends where the screws are, and there is very little room under it to get a sponge to clean it off. This is really poorly thought out construction for something that is going to be used often and need to be cleaned often.

It makes outstanding wings but I can only fit 8 at the most in there at once and it takes about 25 minutes to cook them so prior planning is imperative especially if I need a couple dozen cooked. I’m intrigued by the ninja pressure cooker air fryer combo machine but since I already have both appliances separately I’m not buying it at this time.

Completely replaced my microwave and oven on small to medium meals within the first week so far.\n\nReason 1: Easy. I set and forget. Place the food (frozen vegetables, chicken, steak, etc) with a teaspoon of oil in the tray, set it to air fry, and in 20 minutes it’s done. (I do come by every few minutes and shake the tray just to check on the food from burning or try and get an even cook).\n\nReason 2: Taste. The food tastes better. Somehow, the air and oil create a crisp on the food that can’t be matched by microwave or oven. And only in 20 minutes.\n\nReason 3: Cleanup. Nothing sticks, reusable like a cast iron pan. Just wipe it down with your favorite oil and use again.

I received it today. Tonight I made panko crusted shrimp and parmesan zucchini slices. They were good. The air fryer is definitely easy to use. Just wash the pan part, dry, and you’re good to go. The controls are pretty self-explanatory. It heats up fast and does a good job of cooking and crisping the food. You need to be careful not to overcook the food. This baby gets hot, as it should and the heat is very concentrated so watch your recipe. Use on line recipes as a guide, but don’t take the times as hard and fast rules. Check the food often.\n\nIt does warm up the kitchen because it is blowing the hot air out, but even with it being 106 degrees outside it wasn’t terrible and it cools down quickly when you get done. It isn’t as loud as our microwave so that is a plus. Clean up is easy for now, we’ll see after using it more if it cleans up as quickly.\n\nThe reason for a guarded 4 star rating is I need to see how well it holds up over time. Also, the food is pretty bland. Air frying doesn’t have the oil to give flavor so more spice is needed. As I learn to ramp up the spice I will revisit my review."},{"reviewerName":"Leanne J.","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Broke within 2 months, very small.","reviewDate":"June 27, 2019","reviewText":"After 2 uses the nonstick came off the grate.

The cooking pan is a bit small, but it hasn't been a problem for two person meals...a little restricted for larger meals. I find that I can load the pan and get the best results by stopping the cook cycle and rearranging the food to get an even browning. I particularly enjoy making fried fish and chicken breasts.

I've made fried chicken, buffalo wings, etc. and it works great. I've made French fries, but if you follow the recipe in the booklet you'll end up with burned fries. By trial and error I was able to find a time/temp setting that doesn't burn the fries. One of the biggest issues I had with this fryer (which not sure it is by design) the air blowers are pretty powerful. That means that if you try to fry anything light, it will fly all over the place. It works great for heavier things like chicken drum sticks, etc, but forget about trying to cook anything on the lighter side."},{"reviewerName":"Keith Carter","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great product really 4 3/4 stars","reviewDate":"July 21, 2019","reviewText":"My wife and I really love this thing and have been using it a lot since we got it. It is very easy to use and just as easy to clean. In reality, it tastes terrible and is extremely hard to bite into, but I said the flavor was 5 star because if you know what your doing the food you cook in it will taste great.\nI'm not sure why I knocked it down 1 star. I would have preferred to knock it down only 1/4 star. It gives you just one additional rack besides the crisper rack for using to dehydrate foods. Of course it is really meant to be used as an Air Fryer and not a dehydrator, but still, this really only gives you enough room to dehydrate a small amount. I was almost able to get an entire slice Apple into the three levels. This is a small thing really, but thee is plenty of room to have almost three more racks and there doesn't seem to be way to purchase more, and I'm not sure if you just bought a replacement of the one they do give you if it work stack like it needs to, so 4 3/4 stars rather than 5."},{"reviewerName":"Charles J.

If we can fit it in the air fryer, we cook it in the air fryer. You are saving energy by heating less air. This one is about as big as I want to go and still treat it as portable. It is light and small enough that you can store it in a cupboard. We take ours in our RV and it's small. Don't think every thing is going to come our perfect. It takes practice to figure out exactly how to cook things in an air fryer. The instructions that come with this one are pretty spot on but you will still have to practice with things that are not covered in the guide. Just realize that you will screw things up and you won't get as frustrated. Much of what you hear about these is hype.

Didn't have any high expectations because we tried hot air toaster oven in the past and didn't work out. This came out surprisingly well. Can reheat fried food without making them soggy. Doesn't taste like leftovers. The whole family uses it. Very easy to use. Our microwave and the Ninja air fryer are now about tied in terms of usage. We have it in the kitchen plugged into an outlet that is hardly used. Didn't want to trip any circuit breakers. 1500 watts is quite a bit. The microwave has it's own dedicated breaker. Don't share the same breaker as it will trip when both are on. It does blow a decent amount of heat from the back. We don't add any oil and any excess oil in the food will drain to the bottom. Last big plus is it's available in ceramic. We have birds so we got the ceramic version as the nonstick version will be too toxic for them.

You have impressed me again. I have the Nutri Ninja Pro blender 900 Watts, bought in 2015, and use it almost daily - LOVE IT - keep saying it has been one of the best investments I’ve done for my kitchen.... & NOW, I’ve invested in the Ninja Air Fryer 4-quart, (which equals 2 LB in the frying basket), and ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT as well! Super user friendly and SOOO EASY to clean!!!\n\nFew things to keep in mind:\n1. Always reheat the Air Fryer before inserting the food.\n2. When prepping your foods, put them in a plastic bag or a container with seasoning of your preference and ALWAYS add a little bit of oil for a light coat to your food items (I use avocado oil or olive oil).\n3. While cooking, check your food every 2-5 minutes, and move it around so that it cooks deliciously even!! (ie. chicken wings every 5 minutes, homemade fries or tostones de pana every 2-3 minutes).\n4. ALWAYS clean your Air Fryer after each use. It keeps it in good condition and coated so that it’s always easy to clean, eliminates odors and flavors from previous meals.\n\nHope this helps, ladies & gents! 😉👍"},{"reviewerName":"MorningGlory","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Will be a nice cooking utensil for our RV","reviewDate":"June 14, 2019","reviewText":"It’s taking some experimentation to get use to it but I’m pretty sure this will be great for RVing.

There is a guide that goes with it that tells you how long to cook certain foods, and it takes a couple of times of trial-and-error to get it just right. That is not a complaint, it's just a fact with anything new that you get like this I think. And I can't believe how easy it is to clean! I have gotten things that proclaimed to be easy to clean, but they ended up not being easy.

I made flourless garlic parm wings, normally I baked the wings then broil them for 1 min each side to get crispy but then its gets burnt too quickly and charred.\n\nI seasoned 12 chicken wings cut in halves so that's 24 pieces with salt and black pepper and add 1-2 tablespoons of olive oil tossed around. I added it to the airfryer after 3 mins of preheating and set the temp to 390 degrees and 22 minutes as suggested in the user manual. I’d check on it every 7 minutes to shake the chicken around so that it’s getting crispy everywhere. By about 18 minutes though it looked like If I left it in there any longer it would burn.\nI made my garlic parm sauce and added the wings to the mixture and bam! Best garlic parm wings I’ve ever made at home. I made them a second time and air fried it at 350 for 22 minutes, it got crispy but not as crispy as the first time.\n\nI’ve also made roasted potatoes at the suggested time and temperature and they came out borderline burnt.\n\nUpdate 10/22/19\nI did Shake & Bake chicken to chicken legs. I prepared them just like I would for in the the oven (just shaked it and then baked it - no oil added and the skin was removed). I set the temperature to 390 degrees for 22 minutes using the little reference chart pasted on the airfryer. When it was done it was a little over cooked but the drumsticks were crispy and still a little juicy. I think 20 minutes would have been perfect.\n\nOverall I love how fast food cooks in this but i think the temperatures suggested in the book might be too high or the timing is too long. So you have to be careful and check on your food at least 4 minutes before the end time to check its not getting burnt yet. Also, smelling the chicken cook in an air fryer is not the most fragrant smell I want in my kitchen - it just smells raw BUT tastes the opposite which is good.\n\nUpdate 10/25/19\nI'm starting to wonder if my machine is too powerful. Because it cooks stuff a lot faster than the suggested time for the temp that's in the book. I did brussel sprouts and the suggested time is 15 minutes at 390 degrees. When I passed it halfway through to shake up the brussels, they were already burnt. I had to take them out immediately."},{"reviewerName":"Tommy","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Ninja Air fryer was a great deal to choose","reviewDate":"June 1, 2019","reviewText":"I have did many research and decided to take a try with a Ninja Air Fryer.

It’s a bit small but there are only 3 if us in the house so it works for us. Often I make meals where I want to cook both entree and sides in it so I’ve even thought about getting two! When I first took it out there was a hint of plastic smell. I removed the plastic feet from the elevated insert tray and threw them out. No more smell or hot plastic to leak toxins.

He gave raving reviews so I decided to just purchase a new Ninja instead of trying to get a replacement basket.\nI got the Ninja and all was well. There's a bit of a break in period because Emeril cooked way differently than Ninja and they both have slightly different settings. The Ninja cooks great, makes the perfect roasted garlic cloves, and is easy to wash. BUT I miss Em. In the two years of owning him, he never once burnt me. He had an awesome detachable basket fo easy handling. All I had to do was put food in, remove the basket and dump the dinner on the plate. Ninja on the other hand.... Ninja has burnt me 4 separate times since he arrived. You remove the entire cooking thing and then have to use tongs or something to get the food out. That's not super awesome when you make things like brussel sprouts.

It has changed the way we cook many things. Very pleased.\n\n8/3 roasted our first meatloaf. Came out perfect. Shape meatloaf to a round bun shape to fit the pan. I air roasted @ 325 degrees for about 15 minutes then topped it off with a ketchup/brown sugar mixture and roasted another 10 minutes until internal temp reached 150 F. Came out delicious with a nice crust. Family loved it.\n\nLast week I air roasted potates that were peeled and cut into French fries. Soak them for about 30 minutes in ice water. Drain, wipe dry with a paper towel and put in a bowl. Pour some oil (I used olive oil) in and toss potatoes until well coated. Preheat oven for about 7 min. @ 375F, then toss in fries with a pinch of salt and air roast @ 350-375F for about 10 minutes. Remove pan, shake it a bit to mix up fries and roast for another 10-15 minutes until desired color. Perfect!\n\nTonight I am making the family roasted salmon filets. I will write how they turn out.

We originally had another air fryer from a different brand, which we loved, but one day the fryer stopped working (we assumed it’s cuz we used it SO much).

We got it because of the size and because Amazon was having a great $30 off price on it.\n\nWe were BLOWN away with how much better this air fryer was compared to our last!

After all, I've heard often that air fryers are basically just tiny convection ovens. Decided to try it anyway because nobody is ranting and raving about convection ovens.\nAs it turns out, this thing can actually make all kinds of stuff and I've really been enjoying it. Fries/roasted potatoes have been really good solely because of the smaller wait time, but I've also made mini hamburgers, roasted veggies, reheated pizza, crispy tofu (which was unexpectedly REALLY good because I've never been able to get it that crispy without a coating before) and last night I decided to throw in some frozen gyoza and pizza rolls as a late night snack. All of it has turned out great. I haven't used my oven in weeks.\nCleaning couldn't be easier. The only thing getting in the way of you cleaning it after every use is being lazy.\n\nOverall I'm definitely satisfied.

Its easy to use and there aren't any complicated instructions and it is extremely user friendly. No peeling of the non-stick coating as some people have noted with other air fryers.

I won't mention it so people don't think I am promoting or have a negative agenda toward any product.\nCompared to that other fryer, this unit is much louder. Some compare the Ninja to a microwave oven. Here are my sound readings in decibels. This is for comparison only as my sound meter has not been calibrated.\nFrom five ft.\nSmall/Medium microwave: 58 db (about the sound of people talking).\nNinja: 66 db (about the sound of a vacuum in an adjacent room).\nWhat is the difference? I'll not go into the physics of sound and energy, but for every 3 db difference, there is a substantial increase in perceived sound. My subjective impression is the Ninja is about twice as loud as my microwave 3x that of my previous air fryer.\nI'd be interested in the most reliable and usable air fryer that is also the quietest."},{"reviewerName":"Jill","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"I am in love!","reviewDate":"June 19, 2019","reviewText":"I super duper love my air fryer!

Does not taste like true fried food.","reviewDate":"June 26, 2019","reviewText":"Taste: My wife and I bought an air fryer because a lot of people told us they made great fried food without the calories. Most reviews rave about the taste. The taste, to us, is not the same as true fried food. It's ok, but it does not have that true fried taste. For example, I tried several different recipes for fried chicken, wings, and french fries. None tasted great, but were just ok. So, if you want true fries food taste, you won't get it with the air fryer. However, if you want to reduce caloric intake and can tolerate a bit of a different flavor, it might work for you. Also, in order to get the closest fried food taste and texture the pieces cannot touch each other. We could only fry 1 small chicken breast, thigh, and leg at a time. So, if you have more than 2 people to feed at the same time, it won't work. Also, you need to cook french fries in small batches. We could only cook 4 wings at a time, too. That includes removing the tips. Finally it takes a full half hour to make one batch of french fries. With our fry daddy, we could easily make 4 batches in the same amount of time.\n\nEase of use: It is easy to use, but most recipes require turning over the food to cook evenly. There is not a need to do that with a deep fryer, thus a 4 not a 5.\n\nCleaning: although it is a lot easier to clean than a deep fryer, you must clean some of by hand. IOW it is not entirely dish washer friendly.\n\nI suggest having a friend or family member make you something your very interested in trying before you buy.

It's great for summer cooking in the South where I want to heat up my kitchen as little as possible. Most things I would roast or bake go right in the air fryer instead, conserving energy and cooking much quicker. We even ditched our toaster oven and gave up its counter space to the air fryer! Everything gets crisp but do watch it closely because stuff can burn if you let it go too long.\n\nMy one complaint is what I think is a design flaw. The basket which goes inside the drawer and holds the food has some larger vents and holes and smaller foods fall through, like okra and small chilies. Also, the handle for lifting it out is tiny, in the center, and needs tongs to get it out. This makes it hard to dump out the hot food in the basket without oil drippings from the bottom falling out too. This hasn't kept us from using it, however, and we just keep a pair of silicone tipped tongs and a hot pad next to the fryer for serving the food.

A+++","reviewDate":"July 7, 2019","reviewText":"This is by far the best thing I bought this year. It’s so easy to use, clean, and you can cook all your favorites super fast. It’s dishwasher safe, which is a huge plus and makes clean up easy, one thing I hate about my croc pot which needs to be hand washed. So far I’ve made chicken wings (best my boyfriend has ever had), chicken legs, brussel sprouts, shrimp and tonight I made salmon. The salmon was so juicy but had the charbroiled crispy taste on the edges. I only had to cook it for 15 minutes. For those that work full time jobs, it makes cooking dinner that much easier. I read several reviews on different air flyers and this seemed to have the most positive reviews. A few users complained about the smell of plastic which I never experienced. I made sure to run it through the dishwasher before it’s first use. If you’ve been debating about an air fryer, then now is the time to give in and purchase one. You won’t regret it. I find myself using this more than my croc port now."},{"reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Life changer","reviewDate":"September 18, 2019","reviewText":"Can’t believe I haven’t written this review yet..

I am not convinced it is any kind of \"fryer.' On the other hand, as a mini-convection oven, it is really convenient - fast to pre-heat and really quick and easy to clean. Bags of frozen fires (TJ's simple ones) were disappointing compared to tossing them in oil and baking on a cookie sheet in the oven. On the other hand, i was very happy with burgers i cooked in it and with chicken I browned quickly and, then, cooked in it. I think I will find more uses for it, but it is not a \"gotta have\" for me, although the convenience, as mentioned is great."},{"reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Just get it","reviewDate":"February 26, 2019","reviewText":"I have used this to make chicken nuggets and waffle fries WAAAYYY too many times.

I've noticed preheating seems to help the cook a lot more.\n\nA few years ago I wanted to get a fryer to make chicken wings. I ended up getting an oil fryer, and had been using that to make wings, it was amazing. Just made chicken wings with this air fryer, it was surprisingly good. I tossed them in oil, and cooked for the time it said in the booklet (I think 390 for 22minutes?). So my point is, this makes pretty good wings, I don't know if I'm sold on this over the oil fryer for that, but if you don't know the difference then I'd say get the air fryer."},{"reviewerName":"Ms PB","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Glad I finally bought one.","reviewDate":"February 6, 2019","reviewText":"Love all the features of this air fryer.

Make sure you clean inside, up by the heating element against oils, etc. Also make sure you operate this near a vent or something as certain items (wings, meatballs, etc.) will pump smoke out the back. Not crazy smoke but still. Definitely recommend. And yes, i said wings and meatballs... They come out amazingly! Wings crisp and other things fully cooked and delicious!

The recipes tell you to set the time for 20 minutes but to return back and \"shake\" the contents for best quality. Even when I would flip my food over completely it would still end up raw on bottom and burnt on top.\n\nIn short, either this is not worth the $106 after tax, or it really was a defective item.\n\nOn the otherhand, It was in fact super easy to clean and easy to use (to get burnt/raw food) but easy enough controls.

Of course most foods don't taste exactly like they've been deep fried but the healthy aspect of it far outweighs the difference imo. Plus you don't have to wait around for your little deep fryer to heat up as long either. This unit heats up quickly so you really don't have to do any preheating if you don't want to.

I love my Ninja blender/food processor combo and when I saw this brand on sale I felt I could trust it, as there are a plethora of air fryers out there. Keep in mind I had never used one before, did no research and had no expectations. I read the instructions, looked up some recipes and came to the conclusion I just needed to jump in and try some things based on what I read. I follow the Trim Healthy Mama lifestyle (avoiding wheat flour when possible) so I substituted some other flours. So far I have been pleased and found that I use it about once or twice a week. There are just two of us to cook for, but when the grandchildren visited I threw in some fries, some fish sticks, some chicken nuggets (both pre-made and made from scratch) and they came out great. Anything pre-frozen, like fried okra or sweet potato fries would come out nicely and quickly. However, since I am more of a whole foods kinda girl, I am experimenting with my own, from scratch, foods.\nSo far squash does well and green beans not so good. The basket is adequate for 2 people, and the air fryer a bit large for a countertop appliance but I keep it in the pantry and just take it out when I need it. Another thing I like about it -it is sooo easy to clean. I can have it cleaned up and back in the pantry in less than 2 minutes. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I have never tried any other one so I have nothing to compare it to.

Cooking a chicken breast can take 45+ minutes in an oven, and I can have a fully cooked breast in 20-24 minutes in the air fryer.

The first week we cooked every meal in our air fyer. This product is easy to use, easy to clean and quick to cook. It comes with a good recipe book for anything you can think of. The 4 quart is the perfect size for sitting on the counter and cooking space. I have a family of 3 and even though I've had to split certain meats like pork chops, the cooking time is still less than an oven. I was worried just how crispy everything would but I have been very impressed with everything I have made. Even the air fryer okra was amazing!

Amazing no doubt."},{"reviewerName":"Lisa Lockwood","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Super easy to use!","reviewDate":"July 17, 2019","reviewText":" Just got my air fryer today and I already used it! We couldn’t wait to try it out. Plus we got it on amazon prime day for only $66.\n\nSo far we just tried potato wedges. We prepared them two ways. On way was costing them with egg, flour and panko. The other way was using oil and garlic with other seasonings! Both turned out great. The one with panko had a super crispy outside! It was amazing!!\n2nd day update:\nToday we air fried fresh Broccoli and frozen egg rolls! It’s perfect!!! Super crisp on the outside! You can hear the crispiness in the video I added!\n\nWe can’t wait to try other recipes and I’ll update my review when we try new stuff."},{"reviewerName":"Trish H.","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Awesome product!!","reviewDate":"February 21, 2019","reviewText":"Love.

I love it. I wanted this item because I trust Ninja and do not like preheating my oven for one small item. I have cooked chicken, steak, pork chops, fish and veggies in it. It is the perfect size for 1 or 2 people.

I’ve had this for about 3 weeks and use it nearly everyday. Great and convenient for potatoes, veggies, bacon, sausages, chicken tenders + more!! Clean up is hastel-free.\n\nIt’s small, but can cook enough for 4-6 people. Cook time just takes longer if you’re making more.\n\nAlso... this is the first review I have ever written on a product.

Extremely easy to clean. And cooks food very evenly and well regardless to how much food is used. Most air fryers I have use need the food to be in a single layer.

Figured it would pay for itself in few uses versus ordering out Chinese a few times a week. Now I cook with it almost daily, be it air frying, roasting, or dehydrating. Pairs well with a vegetable chopper to ensure everything is a consistent size. I also recommend using less oil than the companion cookbook suggests. Just toss your food in a Tupperware-ish container to ensure even coating with less oil. Easy to make “one pot dishes” as well by simply adding your ingredients in phases based on needed cooking time. Attached photo is “one pot” sweet potato home fries with vegan sausage. Much easier to clean up than my cast iron skillet and far less oil used in my food."},{"reviewerName":"Groovy Gammy","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Super Easy and Super Tasting Food!!

I started off by throwing some fries in. They came out crispy and not greasy. I next threw in some egg rolls. Same outcome. Next was the real test, freshly caught fish. I whipped up my homemade breading, coated the fish, and threw it in the fryer. The outcome? No surprise.. absolutely outstanding. I honestly don’t know how I’ve lived without this fryer for this long. I can say that after using it that I couldn’t live without it.

I like the brand so i figured let's start with ninja. Making wings is amazing I cook them for about 20 mins. They come out crispy and tender. No oil used either. we have made veggies too. The one thing is after the third round of wings make sure you clean it out or it start to get smoky in the house"},{"reviewerName":"Ballinonabudget","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Addicted!","reviewDate":"March 19, 2019","reviewText":"I love everything about this air fryer! I will say if you cook something that doesn't naturally have oil in it, it may taste a bit dry, so oil is needed in some instances. However, it cooked food very quickly. I use it daily.

Not a lot of bells and whistles, just a simple air fryer, which is what I wanted. Price is just right! Seems to be built sturdy and doesn't have a cheap feel to it.

To a ridiculous degree - I LOVE tots. I always order them from restaurants that serve them - and I make them at home sometimes - but it's like comparing apples and...zebras. SO not the same result.\n\nFor a while we had a deep fryer and cooking tots that way made them taste great - but was a huge mess and such a hassle that we almost never did it. And then? And then.\n\nWe got this air fryer. To say that I was skeptical would be a huge understatement. The idea that hot air could make things as crispy and wonderful as hot oil? Just seems ridiculous. But it is one that is wonderfully, magically true.\n\nThe tots that came out were PERFECT. Crunchy on the outside, tender on the inside - absolutely perfect. And? SOOOO much healthier! I am still in awe at how this process works. Shaking in the midst of cooking does seem to be a key component - but the idea that only the small amount of oil/fat in the frozen tots themselves can result in this kind of goodness? Amazing.\n\nWe are going to try fried chicken next and I cannot wait to taste it. If I could give this product 6 stars? I absolutely would."},{"reviewerName":"Amy Dru","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"So easy to use!","reviewDate":"November 22, 2018","reviewText":"I'm pretty in love with the Ninja brand. Everything I've ever bought by Ninja has been perfection. This air fryer is no exception!\n\nThe air fryer is incredibly easy to use - select the type of cooking you want to do, set the timer and start. If you are frying, it's important to pause every once in awhile and shake the food so that it gets crispy all the way around (not just on top). That is seriously the only \"trick\" with this thing and that's with all air fryers.\n\nWe LOVE chicken wings in my house, and we cook them in any number of ways : oven, kamado Joe, fryer. But all of these ways take a lot of planning, babysitting, or clean up. The air fryer gives me another option that is so much easier on clean up, and it's inside so better when the weather encourages me to stay inside to cook. I cooked about 2 pounds of wings in the air fryer at a time. I toss the in 2 tablespoons of oil and cook them for about 25 minutes, stopping at least 3 times to shake thrm around a bit. Afterwards, I toss them in sauce and they're deliciously crispy! Win!\n\nI'm looking forward to trying this as a dehydrator. We have a stand alone dehydrator and I love all things consolidating, so I hope this woorks well. I will say that it will not be capable of dehydrating the same quantity of food as our other one. But, if it works well, then maybe I can get rid of my other appliance!\n\nI completely recommend this product - it would be a challenge to find something easier to use!"},{"reviewerName":"Cupcake","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Makes AMAZING wings (Seriously. Better than deep frying, and way less fussy/messy.)","reviewDate":"December 13, 2018","reviewText":"I used a sort of proto-air fryer years ago, but it had an arm to automatically stir the food--a good concept, but too much for all but the sturdiest food. (I called that my Healthy French Fry Machine. I call this my Magical Wings Machine.) While having to stop the machine and shake your food a bit seems like it will be a pain in the neck, it was no big deal, and totally worth it.\n\nThis works great for freezer fries and other prefab fried foods, but where it is really mind-blowing--actually BETTER than the conventional methods, including deep frying--is for wings.\n\nIt makes really amazing wings. We love wings, and I've fried them, wasted a bunch of time with the stupid (overly fussy, not as delicious, probably not any healthier) Alton Brown method for years, and recently returned to frying, though the mess, oil, and attention it requires meant that I was not eating wings as often as I would like.\n\nMaking wings in this air fryer is easier, faster (if you do do the slow/double fry, which produces the best results), and way less messy than either method, and the wings are better--totally moist inside and crispy as heck outside. Though the instruction book called for adding a little oil, I don't like to dirty an extra bowl to toss them, so I skip it with great results. I preheat 3 minutes, then add the wings and cook for 20-22 minutes at 390, shaking once about 10 minutes in, and they are PERFECT. This is now that is the only way I'm making wings. A great fringe benefit is that the excess fat and crispy bits collect in the bottom of the basket and you can use them the next day (or, next course) to make chicken fat fries with it.\n\nThe only downside is that you can really only do about one grocery store tray of wings (14-16, typically) at a time. This is good news for me, because that's the right amount for the two of us to eat without overdoing it, but that also means I won't be using it for a superbowl party.\n\nIn general, that's the only drawback to this machine. It's easy to use, easy to clean, and pretty fracking versatile (you can even do tiny batches of dried foods--this won't replace anyone's dehydrator, but will let you keep that stray apple from going to waste, I guess?). But it is sized for smaller families. Wait, there's one more drawback: it is a space hog, though the footprint is way smaller than most cooking appliances.\n\nBut those wings. I forgive it everything for the wings."},{"reviewerName":"Paul K.","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Junk","reviewDate":"February 17, 2019","reviewText":"Got the air fryer unpacked from the box.

After the three minutes I pulled the pan and the thing wasn’t hot. Put the wings in anyway and let it go until there was 12 minutes left on the timer. Pulled the on again. Still not hot. Stupid thing didn’t even work.

Cousino","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Still learning to like this","reviewDate":"January 7, 2019","reviewText":"My favorite feature of the Ninja air fryer is being able to cook foods that are often fried without using all of the nasty oil - and still being able to obtain that delicate balance of a crisp exterior and and moist interior. This device is perfect for that and to be honest that's mostly what I have used the air fryer for although it does have other options and functions. The quick start guide that comes with the air fryer offers many different suggestions for cooking a variety of foods in a variety of ways. From fruits and vegetables to meats and breaded items, you can air fry, steam, dehydrate and re-heat. I have not tried the dehydrate or steam functions (yet), but when it comes to cooking things like french fries, tater tots, chicken nuggets, (frozen) breaded eggplant - the air fryer is amazing with these things.\nThe quick start guide offers temperature and cooking guidelines for just about anything you can imagine - you generally cook at a slightly lower temperature than you would in the oven and the food cooks faster because of the hot air that is constantly circulating around the food. Thanks to the non-stick coating of the interior cleanup is a breeze and while the cooking basket is dish-washer safe I always wash by hand to help the non-stick coating last longer.\nA few things I'm not crazy about with this machine - it's huge, and it's heavy. It is very tall so may not fit under cabinets if you want to keep it sitting on your counter-top, and it's extremely heavy to lift and move which isn't an issue for a normal/healthy person for for somebody who is elderly or handicapped not a good idea. Also keep in mind that the machine is blowing hot air the entire time, so the sides and bottom of the machine can get very warm - keep this in mind when using it and make sure there's an adequate amount of space between the air fryer and anything around it. My last (minor) complaint - it's loud. Like listening to a loud hair dryer running for a long time which may not bother some, others it may drive them crazy."},{"reviewerName":"T.

I have cooked so much in the first seven days and brag to everyone about how good it is. (My kids are getting tired of me talking about it. P.S. this is my first review ever. But, I thought it was that good!!!\n\n*4 Bake potatoes (15 to 20 minutes). 1 1/2 hour faster than oven. Taste better.\n*Hot dog (2 minutes) like it came off grill\n*frozen country fried steak (5 minutes)\n*Frozen onion rings (3 1/2 minutes)\n*frozen French fries (4 to 5 minutes)\nStuffed jalapeños (9 minutes) 1 hour oven\nBacon (4 minutes) crispy\nFrozen pickles(3 1/2 minutes)yummy\nReheated a slice of pizza(1 1/2 minute) like it came out of pizza oven. Crispy crust—melted cheese!!\n\nI have done few more items but you can see cooking time is cut way down from oven times. I also check on everything about 3 to 4 minute because it cooks so fast. But\nI only do half bag of fries at a time and don’t overload the basket. Because cooking two batches is still faster. Cooking times is shorter than what they list. ( on the peppers I made. I had to cook the peppers and cheese 5 minutes than added the small strip of raw bacon and cooked another 4 minutes. Let sit in basket two minutes before removing it. Because the first batch I had everything on them and had to take the bacon off because it was already done and peppers wasn’t). You just have to play around with timing while getting used it. And I always preheat the unit for three minutes before I add the food to basket. Instructions tell you that also.\n\nNormally I don’t buy a lot of frozen foods but I have realized that most frozen foods that have been precooked cooks very well in the air fryer. Can’t wait to try frozen okra! Still wanting to make fish and homemade chicken fingers. (Oh yeah frozen fingers does great!!!)\n\nOk cons. Just a little loud. Sounds like a hair dryer blowing in kitchen. But I can live with that.

Fries, jalapeno poppers, Brussels sprouts, and anything with a crispy coating taste so much better than oven baking, and they have a better crunch. I love the reheat setting. It's so much more flavorful and crispy than reheating anything in the microwave. My only warning is that you should check the food more often than they suggest - every five minutes rather than 15, because I've found things sometimes get done a lot more quickly than recipes and the included cookbook says.

I tried another brand just before this, the house brand from a well know national electronics store chain, and no comparison. Much better than using the oven, especially in the summer, and to me, baking things that are traditionally deep fried just don't taste right from a conventional oven or toaster oven which has an \"oven taste\". Even though an air fryer, any air fryer doesn't deep fry food of course, you do get better results than in just the plain old oven. You can't get deep fried taste without a deep fryer, that's physics, but air fryers, and especially the Ninja does a great job at getting closer to real fried taste, and helps to spritz your food with oil first, as the air fryer will heat that oil much faster than a plain old oven while it's on the food, and that really helps initially crisping things up and browning. Pork loin chops in 10 minutes, ocean perch in 6 minutes. Makes frozen fries and onion rings better than the oven and quicker. Good on home made fries as well, great on chicken wings.\n\nThis one (4 quart) has an 8 inch round cooking surface area, good for 1 person, or 2 if snacks. The one I took back (5.8 quart) had a 10 inch round area, but in either if more than 1 type of food, have to do in batches.Usually fries first, then meat here, keep fries warm, and while the fries are cooking and you prepare your meat, fries are done! Usually around 7 - 10 minutes depending on french fry thickness and if frozen. I start on 400 degrees after preheating 3 minutes, and then reduce the temp down to 350 or 325 later if browning too fast.\n\nThe Ninja has a crisper plate that goes in the basket, instead of another basket in basket, much easier to clean. Easy digital controls and display. Only small com is you have to press the pause button when you take the basket out to shake of flip food, or it will keep running. The one I took back, had to support with the other hand, and push the basket back in so hard almost topples, and had a wonky display and countdown. The Ninja basket slides in easily.\n\nNinja has great quick responsive customer service, even on Facebook, as I had a question about mine. This one is definitely a keeper. This one goes down to temperatures like 105 or 150 to dehydrate, and will allow you to set the time for several hours in the dehydrate mode, instead of only 60 minutes in the other modes. Also uses a slower fan speed to dehydrate so it doesn't blow drying small food all around. Most other air fryers only go down to 250-300 and 60 minutes max, unless you get certain Ninja Foodi's. I have a friend with a Foodi, great machine if in your budget, and another friend with a Ninja that steams, slow cooks, and has \"stovetop\" whatever that is, but they both love them. Also, if you get yours from somewhere other than Amazon, make sure it has the extra rack so you can put 2 layers to dehydrate, instead of 1, and may also help with bacon. Versions from some stores don't have that extra rack. With an air fryer, any air fryer, don't let how many quarts mislead you. Unless you're roasting a thick piece of meat, or baking a cake, food can't overlap or be on top of each other to truly get the benefit of air frying."},{"reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Cooks great...smells terrible","reviewDate":"February 18, 2019","reviewText":"This was my second air fryer...the food we cooked was very good however we did notice the unpleasant odor while cooking the foods..my husband questioned the rubber feet on the crisping plate as soon as we took it out of the box ..so he removed them...no more smell..I will just have to be extra careful not to scratch the basket now that the rubber is gone ..ninja needs to rethink putting rubber of any kind in an appliance that cooks food"},{"reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"THIS IS THE ONE","reviewDate":"February 25, 2019","reviewText":"I can't be more happier with this air fryer it does everything so well.

I bought this product about a week ago and have used it at least five of those days and it has worked great - food cooks EVENLY, the fries (both frozen and homemade) were crisp and enjoyable, and the wings were cooked perfectly. When I cooked these in the oven or in an oil-based frier I found there were uneven heating areas where some places would cook at the right temp but others wouldn't or with the frier the food turns out soggy and it's extremely difficult to clean. The Ninja air fryer is aboslutely none of that. If you had your doubts like me at first, you can be safe knowing it's worth the money.

I didn't cook anything in it, so I'm not sure how well it works. It had a very strong plastic/ rubber/ paint thinner type of smell when I opened it. I ran it on empty on my patio twice for 30 minutes each time, and the smell improved but did not go away. We could still smell the chemical smell even with it outside. We specifically purchased this one over others because it had a porcelain coated surface which is considered safer than teflon type coatings. I wouldn't feel comfortable serving my family food out of something that smells like this. Even if the smell went away, it doesn't seem like anything your food touches should smell like this. Definitely returning. Disappointing because I also had to return a Ninja blender recently for not working properly.

Bush","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Happy with purchase","reviewDate":"January 24, 2019","reviewText":"I bought this for a quicker/easier way to roast vegetables, but it has proven to be a very useful appliance. I've made sweet potato fries, roasted Brussels sprouts, chicken wings and breaded fish. I tried the Brussels sprouts first, spraying them with a little olive oil, and using salt and pepper; i was a little nervous at using the air fryer for the first time, so i didn't leave them in as long as the directions suggested and they didn't get as crispy as i wanted. When i make them again, i will follow the recipe suggestion on time. I was better with the sweet potato fries; they mostly turned out cripsy, again, with a simple spritz of olive oil. The chicken wings turned out perfect. i dusted them in flour and seasoning. The wings were cut up in pieces; the smaller pieces took less than 7 minutes, with me turning them over once, before they were done. The little drummettes took about 9 minutes. I breaded the fish in panko and gave it a spray of oil; perfectly tasty.\n\nI made fairly small amounts of the food and it cooked quickly and evenly. The tray has space for much more, if you were cooking for more than one or two that I was. I think it would take longer and would involve shaking/flipping food more, though, if you filled the tray.\n\nThe air fryer itself makes a noise similar to a microwave. It's noticeable but not overly loud. The machine continues to run when you open the tray to check on the food; you can also pause it when you pull out the tray to shake or flip food, and then resume when you insert the tray again. The outside of the machine, and the counter below and cupboards above -- no noticeable heat.\n\nI love that the kitchen/house did not smell like the food i was making. Brussels sprouts can leave quite an aroma when roasting in the oven, but the house remained fairly aroma free after all the different things i made.\n\nAnd lastly, cleanup was super easy. I just used a soft, nonabrasive pad to clean in the sink.\n\nVery happy with this purchase, and as i only cook for one or two at a time, this is perfect, a better option than heating up my oven for just a chicken breast or a handful of fries."},{"reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Gifted to friend","reviewDate":"November 16, 2018","reviewText":"Too heavy for me.

So far as I am concerned this Ninja thing is all about french fries and I don't care whether the opening gambit is frozen or fresh cut. Either way, it doesn't measure up. To start with the user has to monitor the cooking time to make sure the basket is regularly jostled and if the amount in the basket is anywhere published capacity, it is not going to matter how much shaking was going on. A goodly portion of the fries are either not going to get crispy or the bottom layer on the crisper is going to be substantially deeper fried than the remainder.\n\nConversely, the T-Fal has an agitator wand so you can set it and forget it. Yeah, there are other bells and whistles with the Ninja like the convenient temperature and timer controls, the fan is not as noisy as the T-Fal, It has a roasting feature and admittedly, if you're frying chicken pieces it doesn't beat them to a pulp (BUT you do have to pause the process and manually turn the pieces) however when I think air fryer I'm only interested in how well it handles french fries and the Ninja currently sits as my fourth choice behind deep frying, range top frying pan and the aforementioned T-Fal.\n\nIf I'm going to dehydrate anything, it's because I fried it too long."},{"reviewerName":"D.

Jensen","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"One of the few products I would definitely buy again.","reviewDate":"January 16, 2019","reviewText":"There is a bit of a learning curve when learning to airfry. There are very few \"reliable\" time/temp resources available. However using the Ninja Air fryer is very intuitive and you quickly get the hang of creating cooking times/temps for new food items items you've never cooked before. The airfrying results you get with the Ninja are remarkable. I have owned other brands and they didn't perform near as well. The only negative I can think of, is the fry basket on the Ninja is smaller than some others. It is definitely made for cooking for two people. Nevertheless the Ninja works so well I could care less about that. By the way, the ceramic coating is remarkably easy to clean. I've airfried pork chops, hamburgers, wings, brussel sprouts etc and nothing sticks to it.

First of all you have to figure out the way to put your food in there because if it doesn't get the air around it doesn't get the fried crispness. I've also learned that it Cooks more like a convection oven and cooks much more quickly than your standard oven. You can absolutely overload it and I can cook most of a dinner in this thing if I time it right. I have preschool children and we do a lot of chicken nuggets and fish sticks and french fries. This has been an awesome kitchen tool, it even cooks faster than my toaster oven and takes less time to preheat.\n\nIt looks like a little space pod sitting on your counter. It's user-friendly as far as learning how to cook and if you read the instructions first you avoid a lot of mistakes. Take it from someone who didn't think I needed to read them. Last night I made 'fried chicken' tenders using panko bread crumbs and it was outstanding. It's super easy to clean and even says that it's dishwasher safe. I wouldn't want to eroad at the non-stick finish so I hand wash and it cleans up in a minute. This is kind of one of those things you didn't know you needed until you had it.

In all cases, I followed recipes to the T, and did periodic cooking checks and shaking to help avoid hot spots. I used high heat canola, while also experimenting with olive and vegetable oils--and sprays.\n\nEvery item I cooked turned dark and borderline burned, before ever turning crispy-- regardless of method.\nTaste was average, and I found myself wondering why I was hassling with this-- vs. using my tried and true toaster oven.\n\nI know all the true believers will assume I didn't do something right.

Over the years, I have reviewed many nutrition supplements, exercise equipment, here on Amazon and every year, I use the summer to try something new in my diet/exercise. This late spring/early summer, I decided to try a very basic style of eating. It is not fully Keto or Carnivore but it might look like it to some people. My main meats to eat this summer are Ribeye steaks and non-fatty fishes (sorry salmon, you will be back in fall and winter).\n\nA friend of mine has an air fryer and was going on vacation. I asked if I could borrow their air fryer for a few days. The first thing I threw in it was homemade onion rings and they were great as expected. I think I was hesitant to try a meat in it. I wanted to look at it a lot like a deep fryer. That's where I was making my mistake. It is nothing like a deep fryer. My onion rings were golden and had zero grease on them. The next day I took the chance and put two 12 ounce Ribeyes in it. I seasoned them with Montreal Steak seasoning and used a little avocado oil to add some healthy fats. I ate both of them! My wife came home from work and wanted to know where her steak was. I blamed the puppy. I still had my friend's air fryer for 5 more days but I went ahead and ordered this one by Ninja. The Ninja is making the steaks even better. I do not know if maybe my friend's air fryer has been used a lot or is not as good as the Ninja or what but I lost that skepticism.\n\nI tried this Ninja with pollock lightly breaded with Panko. My only complaint was I could not fit more in the basket! One of my concerns was how long the air fryer would take to make Ribeyes and to make my favorite white fishes. I have used it so much, I can tell you exactly how long they take.\n\nFor 1.5 pound of Ribeye, it could be two 12 ounce, it could be three 8 ounce (if you can squeeze them in), I do 7 minutes on 390, flip them for another 7-8 minutes and they're perfect.\n\nFor 1.5 pound of lightly breaded white fish, I put it on 360 for 5 minutes, flip them for another 6-7 minutes or until the breading is golden and they're perfect.\n\nI have a Zojirushi grill in the kitchen and I still love it for sandwiches and breakfast items but this Ninja has taken over my biggest and most important meals. Like most, I am not satisfied with it just cooking my favorite meals. I tried some fresh broccoli with seasonings in it and it was really good. They need to make one of these with two baskets in it!\n\nHere are the only tips I have used and would recommend to others that are similar to me. I use avocado oil in any of the foods I cook in it. My skeptical friends are saying \"I thought it was oil-less?\" The oil is going to get you more nutrients and avocado oil has a 500 degree smoke point, so it keeps it from smoking. The first time I used my friend's air fryer, I did not realize how hot the top of it was going to get and left it just below a cabinet. Well, the candy bar in the cabinet melted. That was my karma for buying the candy bar in the first place! Be sure to follow the directions when it comes to preheating. You just set it for the temperature you are going to be cooking at for 3 minutes without the food in it. The only extra I ordered for it was the 5 skewers double rack and it was just a little over ten dollars. My wife and I both like the steak, bell peppers, onions, on the skewers and it makes those better than the outdoor grill does.\n\nBest product I have bought in several years. I have not tried the roasting, dehydrating or reheating, not that there is any food left to reheat! I think I know what I am getting some people for their birthdays."},{"reviewerName":"Kathy Langford","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"This is a must have.","reviewDate":"January 22, 2019","reviewText":"I can't say enough about this air fryer. We were wasting a lot of oil trying to deep fry French fries in peanut oil. Of course we all know how bad deep frying is even if you change it after 3-4 times of frying. The fries we made in this air fryer were better tasting than deep fried and plus you only use about a tbsp. of oil such as avocado or olive oil. Much more healthier. I also made fried pickles and they were so good! This will take the place of my deep fryer and most of my pan fried and roasting in the oven. It's easy to use and clean.

There was a bit of a learning curve, as in I regular use EVOO spray when I cook, but after fries coming out a bit too crisp (more like potato chips) I realized the smoke point was too low and I ordered some Avocado oil spray and gave that a shot. AMAZING and a world of difference. The fries, as expected, were great. With a light spray of avocado oil they came out like boardwalk fries, without the greasy residue on your fingers. Wings are tender and juicy on the inside and perfectly crispy on the outside. Steak, (STEAK!) Came out perfect. Medium to medium rare on the inside. Zucchini done for a shorter time comes out steamed with a bit of glazed browning. All the vegetables I've done have come out great. You can cook them to your desired crispness, or cook them a shorter time for more of a steamed finish. Frozen gyoza came out great. Cleanup is SO EASY. I also ordered one of the accessory kits on Amazon and they fit perfect (as long as the accessories are less than 7inches they'll fit fine). I'm so impressed and I have no idea how I've gone this long without one of these. I spray everything with a bit of avocado oil and perfection without all the grease and cleanup. Highly recommend."},{"reviewerName":"R Rated","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Surprised at its versatility","reviewDate":"April 5, 2019","reviewText":"New to me, so I experimented beyond the suggested brochure recommended settings.

I mean when you add frozen, ice covered wings to very hot oil, it creates somewhat of a volcanic explosion of hot spattering oil that goes everywhere, yuck. So I tried this and I'm very impressed. The frozen wings came out very crispy with no mess at all. Here's all I did: Cleaned the unit, dipped each frozen wing in canola oil, then cooked them for about 30 minutes in total but pulled them out every 8 minutes or so to shake them a bit, then pulled them out and tipped the whole fry basket into my hot sauce bowl BUT you shouldn't do this as the ice covering the wings was now melted and lots of water also poured into my sauce and diluted it. Next time I'll just grab each wing with some tongs to keep the water out. Anyway, I think I'll be making wings on a regular basis now as the mess has gone away. Actually you still air frying these in oil at the same temperature but it is just a thin film of oil rather than a deep pool of oil. Very impressive."},{"reviewerName":"LisaKiernan","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Used every day","reviewDate":"December 12, 2018","reviewText":"I didn't want an air fryer.

I had bought another Air Fryer a few months ago and ended up reselling it because it did nothing better than my small gas over, which cooks pretty fast. I was having some serious missing out, seeing everyone rave about their Air Fryers and so when one of my good friends told me she bought this Ninja 4 QT and LOVED it, I figured for $100 I could try again. SOOOOOO thrilled that I did!! I have only had it one day but have made several things, homemade croutons, crispy broccoli, reheating my pizza and I am just getting started! Great size (I am one person but let me tell you how much broccoli I can eat by myself :) ), and super easy to clean. Love the accessories that come with it (crisper basket and drying rack)- I feel like those are key. I don't think it is THAT loud, I mean you can hear it but I was still able to hear my TV in the other room over it. Digital display is great, super easy to use. I am just so happy I have found my true match in Air fryers! It is large, but it is a 4qt so I didn't expect it to be small.

One of the best purchases I’ve made in recent memory. It has changed my cooking experience completely.\n\nᴄʟᴇᴀɴᴜᴘ:\nFirst of all, the cleanup is effortless. Everything I’ve cooked wiped right out with soapy water and a sponge with NO scrubbing.\n\nᴀɪʀ ғʀʏɪɴɢ:\nI have fried chicken wings, and home made chicken strips...battered. To do this, you must buy a spritzer and use it to spray olive oil on the chicken, just enough to glaze the flour. That’ll fry it crispy and golden brown.\nMy wife made fried green tomatoes (so good) that tasted just like gramma’s used to. Delicious.\nI’ve fried battered peaches.\nWhen Air Frying, I recommend setting a timer for half the time you’ve set your AF timer so that you can pause at the halfway mark and flip your food over so that it cooks evenly. I noticed it cooks a bit faster on top than on the bottom. But when it’s finished, it’s crispy and flavorful. This will now and forever be my first option for frying. I think I’m going to buy another one for additional capacity.\n\nʀᴏᴀsᴛ:\nI haven’t “roasted” anything yet but I have baked some cinnamon rolls in it. They turned out fantastic. This AF can do just about anything.\n\nᴅᴇʜʏᴅʀᴀᴛᴇ:\nI’ve dehydrated fruit (peaches and strawberries) and I’ve made beef Jerky. All came out good. Very good. As a matter of fact, the beef jerky I made was the best I’ve ever tasted. I’m not just saying that. The way I seasoned and marinated it overnight made it really flavorful throughout. The more I chewed, the more flavor I got. Season some eye of round with seasoning salt and six-pepper seasoning. Blend some Worcestershire sauce and steak chop marinade together. Put your seasoned eye of round in the marinade and let it sit overnight in the fridge. Dehydrate for 6-7 hrs. Perfection.\n\nʀᴇʜᴇᴀᴛ:\nBottom line? This AF reheats food and it tastes as good if not better than it did originally. Chicken and pizza especially. No more rubbery chicken and pizza with the warmed-up-outta-the-fridge taste. It tastes like it was just made when reheated in the Ninja AF101.\n\nMy microwave is giving my AirFryer the side eye. My oven isn’t too fond of the situation either.\n\nAt the end of the day? I’m actually looking for excuses to use it.

Daniels Jr.","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"I LOVE THIS DANG AIR FRYER!!!!","reviewDate":"March 4, 2019","reviewText":"Let me get the formalities out of the way. This is a great product and I'm very satisfied with it so far. That being said, this absolutely is a game changing appliance. I would go as far as to say, with some design changes, this could easily replace the microwave. I watched a ton of YouTube videos on air fryers before choosing the Ninja. I already have the Ninja Auto IQ blender and use it almost daily.\n\nI've never owned an air fryer but in many of the YT videos, when frying chicken or fish all of the youtubers spray oil and flip the meat halfway through the process. This appears to be necessary because the air fryers don't cook the meat evenly on the bottom and the meat must come into direct contact with the air from the fan located at the top of the appliance and will usually result in chalky spots of batter that remain uncooked. I have found with the Ninja air fryer this is unnecessary. I thought it was the wattage but when I look at other air fryers most have a high wattage than the Ninja which is only 1550 watts., I've seen as high as 1800 watts. So it has to be Ninja's design. Also, I noticed most Youtubers were cooking fried chicken for example for 20 minutes or longer. My first batch, pictured with the Ninja, came out great but had a slightly burnt taste, it was good but could be better but that was because I cooked it for 22 min on 390!!! I also stopped it at 12 minutes and flipped the pieces even though they were golden with no floury spots. For my second batch, I brought it down to about 18 minutes and only paused the air fryer to check them and gave them a shake just in case any were sticking. The end result was much better and close to perfect. Also, I failed to mention that the device doesn't really generate that much heat and doesn't stay hot like a deep fryer or cast iron skillet. I live in a small apartment I did have a tiny problem with it setting off the smoke alarm. Not because it puts out tons of smoke but mainly because where I placed this on my counter was near the smoke detector. Moving it to another area solved this issue. Most importantly clean up is a breeze, no scrubbing, no grease to empty or store. After air frying there's maybe a tablespoon of oil at the bottom and I honestly think it's the olive oil that I dabbed on...I really don't think this thing needs any oil. Rinsing it off with warm water is all it really needs, no splatter...nothing. This is what kept me frying things to be honest, I hated the mess and cleanup.\n\nNow on to what I think is the most underrated feature on this air fryer REHEAT!!! If you've every gone to the fridge and grabbed a piece of leftover pizza, fish or chicken, if you warm it up in the microwave, it's always soggy, it's something we've learned to live with. I took my chicken wings from the day before put them in the air fryer on reheat for 3 MINUTES.....I SAID 3 MINUTES!!! and like magic the wings were crispy like they were right out of the oil. French fries from the day before...same thing crispy and fresh tasting. Fried catfish perfect. In short, I don't run out and buy every gizmo I come across like make your own sodas at home or a bread maker. Not that these aren't great but I have to weigh the versatility of the device, how much soda am I really going to make? Do I really eat that much bread? The Ninja AF-101 was a great choice because it does more than one thing, it's not just a fryer but a roaster, a dehydrator. My next test will be beef jerky, I'll update my review then. Until then, it is one of the best purchases I've made appliance-wise in a while and I can't see myself in the future without one. Now if they can only make one large enough to fit a 12 lb turkey in, I can die a happy man."},{"reviewerName":"Sparkle","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Surprising, No Removable Inner Basket","reviewDate":"June 7, 2019","reviewText":"This is not my first air fryer. I had a Phillips prior to the Ninja. I gave it away because I didn't like the controls. When I saw the Ninja as a deal of the day I ordered it. I do like the controls and it's much larger than I thought it would be. But, what surprised me is it has no inner liner basket! So, it say to preheat it prior to putting your food in to air fry. However, when you put in your food, you have to pause the air fryer, pull out the basket, put in your food, no liner, and then reset the temp and time to cook your food. It sort of defeats the purpose of preheating the unit if you have to pause it. All the heat dissipates when you remove the air fryer base basket and then push it back in. The other fryers I've seen have a removable liner basket inside the actual air fryer base basket. So you can remove the liner, push back in the air fryer basket, and still let the air fryer keep it's temperature, sort of like a drawer that you can close so the heat remains in the cavity of the air fryer. Not so with this Ninja. That to me is a big disappointment. So, I may not keep it. It's also quite noisy compared to my previous air fryer. It did cook the food well. I did air fried carrots. It also was easy to clean since there is only one piece with a bottom grate to clean."},{"reviewerName":"Mike","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Wow!

Like the others, this is a well designed, easy to clean and use fryer. Ninja seems to make their products a bit more heavy duty than others and this is well made. The pan is a non stick coating as the crisper plate that fits securely in the pan but comes out easy to clean. It did emit a “new paint” smell initially, I ran it for five minutes on high. After that, no residual smell. First off, it made perfect crispy wings like we like them but we’re experimenting with even less oil that works well.\nWe now just brush on oil lightly and will try a spray bottle as some have suggested. Tried mushrooms and green beans, loved them as well.

My problem is with the non-stick coatings on the basket and trays. For the first 4-5 months I was hand-washing them in the sink with a sponge, and the coating rubbed off the tray and started rubbing off around the 'feet' indents in the basket. I ordered replacement trays from Ninja's website, and started putting tray and basket in the dishwasher every night instead. The coating on the trays seem fine, though after four more months the little metal handle in the center of the tray I was using broke off. The real problem is the basket; the coating has been flaking from around the indents and along the back curve between the basket floor and wall, and the exposed metal underneath has been dissolving! At some point recently it dissolved all the way through, and last night when I made a fatty steak molten fat leaked out through the bottom of the tray and left a puddle inside the air fryer (and drips all over my counter and floor.)\n\nI've ordered a replacement basket, which cost nearly half as much as a whole new air fryer. (Replacement trays and basket, with tax and shipping, $64. New fryer with free Amazon Prime shipping, $99 + tax.)\n\nWhen I buy an appliance, I don't consider essential parts of it to be consumable items.

The Ninja air fryer was pretty self explanatory, so i thought. I jumped right in and decided to make homemade fries. They burned. I followed the instructions in the manual and their setting was too high. So i lowered it to 360, instead of 390 and cooked them about 10-13 minutes. They came out great. I struggled trying to find the perfect temperature at first. It will be trial and error until you get the hang of it. I advise that you write down the perfect temp and time for everything you make, it's so much easier now. Honestly frozen fries, chicken, tots, etc seem to taste best. Im still trying to perfect homemade meals. I wouldn't ever go back to frying, it's unhealthy and leaves my house and my hair smelling awful. This at first, had a smell. But I've been using it everyday and it doesn't smell that bad anymore. It was like a movie theater popcorn smell, nothing horrible. I'd buy this brand again. It's easy to clean. Sometimes homemade foods stick because i don't use cooking spray (not good for you).

I don't use it for every meal of course, but I sure use it a lot. The biggest difference vs pan frying, there really isn't oil when you eat your food, so you still get the crispy, but you get a clean taste too.

If you want to be happy with this air fryer please take the time to wash the cooking basket as follows. Use your favorite dish washing stuff and give it some elbow grease prior to rinsing it in warm water. Rinse it out really good, and dry the basket. Next insert the basket into the air fryer, and select air fry button, set the timer for 4 min, make sure you are in a well ventilated area and let the thing do its thing. The reason this is important is the need to 'season' the machine.\n\nThis little gem does what it says it will do, provided you pre heat the unit for at least 3 min, before placing food in a single even layer. Don't be afraid to fill the basket, just make sure to shake everything into place, and check on the food around half way into cooking.\n\nBottom line is, the machine will give you crispy potato chips and fries without all the grease. You will end up using around 60% less fat to get the deep fried taste.(Its very close, it won't have the same feel, because you are using 40% less fat, but the food will come out crispy). I would recommend playing around with different thickness of potato slices, to see what works for you.\n\nUnexpected bonus, my knife skills improved by leaps and bounds, as the machine forced me to cut food into uniform slices for faster cooking time and crispier food.

Adds a unique cooking methodology to my kitchen.","reviewDate":"June 16, 2019","reviewText":"This device will crisp up food items without the need for extra oil, which provides a unique flavor profile relative to other cooking methods. I use it all the time now, most especially for finger foods.\n\nA few important points to consider:\n\n1) While it crisps and browns without the need for extra oil, obviously the prolonged flavor retention on the palate due to clinging oil is lessened; that being said, I do occasionally spray olive oil on the tops of the food items for a middle ground amount of oil-based flavor retention.\n2) There is substantial room for user error by those who don't consider the mechanisms involved in convection air cooking, which explains many of the more critical reviews. For instance, people complain that their foods were burnt on the top and not crisped on the bottom have undoubtedly overloading their basket, and blocked free air flow around the food items; by analogy, one could complain that a deep oil fryer didn't adequately fry the items on the top if they overloaded the basket relative to the oil level, i.e. whether food is adequately fried by either air or oil is fully dependent upon whether the heated air/oil can actually come in prolonged contact with the food items. In the same light people may not be taking the time to flip some of the larger food items to allow both sides to be exposed to the hotter air blast being direct from the top. Taken together, lower numbers of smaller food items is the ideal cooking method, which is perfectly fine for a 2 person family such as mine.\n3) It cooks faster than even their manuals recommend, so be prepared to pause it and look in once in a while.\n4) there is a component of dehydration that occurs with prolonged cooking. Whether or not that is a favorable/unfavorable experience depends on the food type and individual palate (such as crisped largely dehydrated asparagus spears). The dehydrating effect may be more pronounced with reheating already relatively dry previously cooked foods.\n5) I am a vegetarian and so my cooking experiences might be different from omnivore food types.\n\nI do not consider this a gimmick type of small appliance and envision ongoing regular use, and the fact that my wife who doesn't like to cook uses it all the time it a favorable testament to its versatility."},{"reviewerName":"Stacie Vargas","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"I LOVE it","reviewDate":"January 17, 2019","reviewText":"Full disclosure, this is my second air fryer.

They were very impressed with the crispy bits and the coating crisped. No messiness. I can't wait to do my homemade wings. Beef jerky is on my agenda and dehydrated fruit.\n\nI do love new toys. I predict this will be used even more than that electric pressure cooker, and I thought that was awesome. I am glad I didn't go bigger. It takes up a lot of landscape.\n\nUpdate... 2nd use. Precooked frozen wings cooked 8 minutes. Rotated with tongs. Cooked 2 more minutes. Perfect.\n\nPlain frozen uncooked wings, 15 minutes rotate 15 minutes more. Perfect.\n\nPizza rolls. 10 ct. 350 degrees 5 minutes. Perfectly crispy!!"},{"reviewerName":"Manda","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Amazing","reviewDate":"December 19, 2018","reviewText":"This thing is amazing ! I have only had it a short I'm and pretty much used it for everything just to see how it would do and I haven't found anything that can't be cooked in it, frozen or fresh, everything comes out perfect. The crispy texture is also just right. You do have to shake the food around from time to time which is fine for me but other than that your basically free to cook other things and the best part is it cuts your cooking time in half !

It works great but as many of the other reviews suggest, when the recipe book says to cook at 390 turn it down some, 360 is a good setting for most things. I don’t bread anything so I can’t speak for that. My favorite thing to cook is chicken wings. Just toss them in olive oil, garlic salt, paprika, black pepper and cayenne pepper. Cook for 10 minutes, stir them up and another 10 minutes. Delicious. I’ve cooked potato slices and zucchini slices the same way minus the cayenne pepper. I only wish it had a larger capacity."},{"reviewerName":"Sara G.","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Works well, but there are some cons...","reviewDate":"September 23, 2019","reviewText":"Works really well, and gets things super crispy, thanks to the special crisper plate! It does cook a lot faster than expected, which is nice. But you really have to watch it, otherwise you can end up burning your food. The buttons are kind of annoying to set and scroll through. They could’ve definitely made it more user friendly. It’s easy, just annoying. And while it can go to much lower temperatures than other air fryers, it only goes as low as 300 in the air fryer setting, which bothers me. Otherwise, you need to switch to the dehydrate setting. While it fits a lot in the deep basket, I wish it were square to make better use of the inside space and surface area. It would probably store much easier if that were the case, as well. It is nice and quiet while it is running and easy to clean. And one of the main reasons I chose to order this one over other brands was the ceramic coating, which is the safest nonstick coating and doesn’t peel. While the cooking guide it came with is very useful, I do wish it came with a cookbook. This would’ve been a helpful feature to really introduce all the possibilities. Otherwise, I’m pleased with it."},{"reviewerName":"SundayAtDusk","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Easy To Use, Easy To Clean . . . .","reviewDate":"March 15, 2019","reviewText":"When air fryers first came out, they were very expensive and I did not believe they could fry food like a deep fat fryer, so I ignored them for years. Then, for some reason, I started looking at them and decided to get one. A mid-price one was what I was looking for, and there are lots and lots of mid-price ones! Finally, I decided on a Ninja because they make such good blenders, and it looked like an easy-to-use and easy to clean one. It is. It's simple to use and the drawer and metal plate easily wash in the dishwasher. So far, I have mostly cooked fried chicken, onion rings and french fries.\n\nNo, the chicken isn't exactly like fried chicken cooked in a deep fat fryer, but it's close enough, as long as you bread it and spray on oil. (I am using a Misto sprayer bottle and light olive oil.) This Ninja comes with a helpful manual and some recipes. There is also a sticker on the fryer itself with times and heat settings for various foods. I don't think those times and heat settings are always accurate, but you learn as you go along what works best. In addition, it only holds about 3-4 chicken thighs, so it's not for someone who wants to cook big batches of food at a time; but it works for me, and is so much easier to use and clean than a deep fat fryer. Healthier, too. :)"},{"reviewerName":"Cameo M. Curnutt","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Goodbye oven!","reviewDate":"April 11, 2019","reviewText":"Love this thing!

Perhaps Ii expected too much, but it just wasn't that great. There are only two of us, but when I fixed fish, I couldn't fit 3 fillets in the air fryer, so I ended up frying one on the stove - which actually allowed me to compare the two. The fried fillet was infinitely better, hands down. The fillets in the air fryer just weren't very crisp... they were just 'sort of' crisp. Then I tried frozen french fries. They might have been good, I don't know.... I sort of forgot about them, didn't know they were done, and they sat there all night. Looking at them the next day, it looked like they had overcooked. It's not that hard to clean, but it's just 'one more thing to clean' after dinner. And 'one more thing' to set up in order to use.

I find it is not noisy as some have said; mine had a slight odor the first time I preheated it, but that dissipated quickly. I have reheated leftovers, made French fries, cooked yams in it, and made donuts. It arrived Sunday and this is Wednesday, so I am trying to give it a good breaking in. The donuts were from a recipe book that was a kindle unlimited choice, and the recipe was a failure. (Not the air fryer's fault. They were too runny to roll out, so I just poured them into the basket. They tasted great, they were just not donuts.) On these warm days, it's nice not having to heat up the kitchen with my range.

It really saves time and effort and the results are very good, often better than traditional methods. No more two step cooking - browning on stove top then roasting in big oven. No more babysitting a pan, meticulously turning foods to ensure even browning and to avoid burning. It is changing the way I've cooked for decades. I can't say how this Ninja air fryer compares to others but I'm pleased with the performance and the ease of clean up. The only negative I can think of is that the basket size is small so it may not be the best choice for some households.\n\nOriginal:\n\nThe more I read about air fryers the more I wanted one.

I also purchased an air fryer cookbook - healthy air fryer recipes that are easily made by the average cook. I have of course made French fries which are great. But I have also made a pork tenderloin, fried chicken drumsticks, turkey burgers, chicken meatballs, and roast vegetables. The ceramic coating makes clean up very easy.

I loooove that it immediately goes to 20 minutes and holding the up and down time button changes the time from 20 minutes to 15 and then to 1. It's a really nice functionality. It's also a lot quieter than my GoWise and the finished ding/ring is quite pleasant as well. I also really like that the airfryer keeps going if you take the basket out for a second to shake it.

I usually use it twice a day. A ribeye or strip steak is a reallllly nice medium rare in 5 minutes, whether I flip it halfway or not, but it gets a nice sear on the crisping plate in the bottom of the machine that separates the food from the fat drippings. It makes it really easy to collect the fat for making tallow! Now I always have tallow on hand for any skillet cooking or just adding to food later. The airfryer also cooks chicken easily and creates an great crispy outer skin, which takes much longer than beef, but bacon is done in 5 or 6 minutes depending on thickness.

The instructions say to pre-heat for three minutes before throwing in the ingredients, for best results. So why not just automatically have the machine pre-heat for 3 minutes and ping you when it's ready, like an oven? Instead, you have to program the temperature and time to 3 minutes, finish that cycle, and then re-program for what you want.

When I saw the one day only deal on Amazon, I decided to give it a shot and I'm glad I did. Obviously it's not quite like frying something in a vat of hot oil but with the healthier lower fat cooking it truly outways the slight difference in taste. First thing we tried was fresh cut fries and they were really good made with just two tablespoons of oil to fry four medium size potatoes. Next we made breaded frozen fish and it was far superior to baking them. I've had this fryer for a week now and used it to make one or two items a day and every one of them has been real good.

The user guide gives a quick tutorial on how to use and clean. The pieces are easily removable and cleanable. No tugging or pulling or feeling like you're going to break a piece trying to remove it from the basket to clean it. The first two times I ran it, there was a slight smell - the typical smell associated with new plastic. I didn't notice on the 3rd use. I have made fried chicken and donuts - and both only took about 20 minutes. My only \"complaint\" is that the basket isn't bigger, but I knew going in that going in. It is kinda tall, so depending on your cabinet availability, this may be problematic, though it wasn't for me.

Max wattage into a standard 120V receptacle is 1500 watts; 1550 would blow the breaker. Unit sure louder than any microwave we've owned but its excellent performance probably stems from that. It's fan noise and the high velocity air flow is needed to adequately heat the large 4-quart basket. Nice looking, if somewhat buky, on counter. Surprised wife - not pleasantly at first; thought it was unnecessary - but she quickly embraced it after few uses. Will eat healthier and save $$ not using range.

Best for 1- or 2-person household.","reviewDate":"October 27, 2018","reviewText":"What the product does makes this a 5-star item. However, its usefulness may drop to 3 stars for a household with 3 or more people.\n\nAn air fryer is basically a smaller convection oven. It's really cool and fantastic for roasting vegetables, cooking tofu, making tortilla chips, etc... Using this for pre-made frozen items like tater tots is half the time with a conventional oven with a sheet pan. It's also great for reheating leftover pizza, giving the crust a nice crunch. Pretty much everything gets that extra crunch. What I couldn't do were banana chips.\n\nAs great as this small appliance is, the capacity is too small. I have to make multiple batches to feed more than 2 adults OR 3 small children. The basket's diameter is only 8\". The height is a little over 3\", but you shouldn't fill it completely because besides needing the hot air to circulate, you \"shake\" or move the food around at least once through the cooking process, usually more often, which means some space is required. It's cooking surface area is about the size of a small frying pan, so if the quantity of food you cook requires more than an 8\" frying pan, you'll have to cook in multiple batches.\n\nThe result is mostly great. The recipe guideline seems a bit too high on temperature and too long on time. So, you should experiment and make your own chart of recommended cooking time. It's not a set-and-forget type of appliance because you should shake or toss around the food every few minutes.\n\nPreheating is recommended, but there is no preheating button. Therefore, you have to set the desired temperature, set the timer for 3 minutes, then turn on the air fryer. The buttons are easy to use, btw.\n\nClean-up is a breeze. It also fits in the dishwasher, yay!\n\nOverall, this is a great item for cooking a small amount of food quickly. Having to cook larger amount in multiple batches eliminates the time-saving feature because you might as well as bake in the much larger oven. However, this air fryer convinced me if my house oven ever breaks, I want to replace it with a convection oven so I can cook larger amount of food faster. Maybe I'll finish them off in smaller batches in the air fryer to add/enhance crispiness.\n\nEdited to add: though not as fast, it's kind of like a microwave for an oven. You know those crispy savory frozen snacky food, like spring rolls, spinakopitas and Trader Joe's Bird's Nest? I don't know about you, but I don't have the patience to reheat them in the oven for an eternity, so I eat the mushier results from a microwave. However, with the air fryer, the reheating time is somewhere between a microwave and toaster oven, with the result being deliciously crunchy, almost as if you deep-fried or pan-fried them.\n\nAs for its \"frying\" ability, it won't taste or feel truly fried. HOWEVER, that doesn't mean the result not tasty or crispy. For instance, French fries with potatoes or sweet potatoes taste like what they're supposed to taste like because the middle has the starchier texture, but the outer surface is crispy, crispier than oven-baked versions. I'm told soaking the tubers and drying them will increase crispiness, but I don't have that kind of patience."},{"reviewerName":"EmeraldLily","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Best chicken wings ever","reviewDate":"July 14, 2019","reviewText":"Easy to use and clean.

Perfect for a dieter who loves good food! I am defaulting to this one.","reviewDate":"October 19, 2018","reviewText":"I am so sold on this Ninja Air Fryer, 1550-Watt Programmable Base for Air Frying, Roasting, Reheating & Dehydrating with 4-Quart Ceramic Coated Basket (AF101), Black/Gray.\n\nIt works great for me and it looks so awesome on my countertop. It was extremely simple and painless to learn and I figured it out right away after reading the times and temperatures, as well as what attachments to use for any given food.\n\nI have cooked a few items in this air fryer/roaster/dehydrator with pretty good results. Like every cooker you need to watch what you are doing because this is practically an oven. Sometimes you will want to check on your food, to turn with utensils or shake if it is food that might get stuck together and not cook right altogether in a lump. Just like in a real oven or fryer, but much different. Safer. More healthy. You just push pause if you need to check the food, and you have very easy access to it at any time during the process. It really doesn't get hot on the counter. The top and bottom, and the handle stay pretty cool, which is amazing.\n\nI expected three settings. Instead you just use the attachments (basket grill and crisper) depending on what you are cooking and how you want it cooked. If you want the food crispy there is a removable coated metal crisper at the bottom of the basket. If you want a grill to support the food you just assemble it on top of where the crisper will or will not be, which is at the bottom. There is space for the juices to settle, and my favorite part of all is the easy cleanup. Very Easy. So very easy!\n\nI cooked two sizes of chicken breasts in a way that I think would qualify as roasting. No crisper. I marinated the chicken in orange and lime juices with seasoning on the grill. I brushed on a bit of oil as the instructions say. The skin got a bit blackened, but the inside was very juicy and thoroughly cooked. I think I cooked it the max time for chicken breast bone-in. I tried it later with less time so it was not really burned. The chicken was so juicy! The smaller chicken breast was just right at 10-minutes less than the first, which is why I am opting for less cooking time in general. You are allowed to use liquid on the surface of the food.\n\nI cooked breaded zucchini with the crisper. This was a bit tricky because as the instructions say you need to pay extra attention and care to pressing the breading onto the food. I didn't put that much on anyway over the egg mixture. I had to make sure that the breading was on right, patting it with my hands and fingers. I sprayed oil on from a bottle. It came out nice. I was going off script so I am happy it turned out so much better than I expected.\n\nJust like oil you wouldn't want your food boiling or actually frying in there. Use caution with heat and liquid as it is an electrical appliance. You can put the attachments in the dishwasher but not the actual cooker please.\n\nIf you have little pieces of food in the cooker you might want to fasten them down with toothpicks, as per instructions. The fan can blow them around if they are too loose in there.\n\nYou can adjust temperature and time independent of each other but on the same display. Then the timer shows on the LED display while your food is cooking, since that is what you will be watching, and because you already saw the temperature you set it for. There is a sticker on the machine with hints for temps and cooking times. I think it is just a visual illustration cluing you into how to use this air-fryer/cooker. I got it to work right out of the box after I prepared the food.\n\nI have to remember to register it too.\n\nI will be using this regularly. It is just a dream.\n\nEnjoy."},{"reviewerName":"OlyNomad","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Simple to use for making healthier meals","reviewDate":"October 18, 2018","reviewText":"We've been using this for two weeks now and it's a great unit and we've been happy with how food turned out in it. Most nights it's just the two of us and this is just the right size for us. If you have a big family you'd likely want something bigger. I like this size also because we can keep it out on the counter if we want to and don't have to put it away all the time. It is a nice looking unit.\nWe've made veggies, fries and chicken in it so far and they all were tasty. I like that it's healthier than cooking it all in a bunch of oil. I also like it because I can make our dog's homemade treats in it.\nIt's easy to use and to clean up and came with ample instructions, including cooking chart times and preparations and a dehydrate chart and basic recipes."},{"reviewerName":"Matthew Erwin","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Requires some experimentation","reviewDate":"November 19, 2018","reviewText":"Your best course of action is to take that \"recommended cooking time\" booklet that comes with the Ninja Air Fryer and burn it. It is useless. 100% of the time it will incinerated your meal if you follow that book.\n\nThat said, when carefully watched and experimented with, the air fryer has given me some tasty food!\n\nMy first item was french fries. I cook these often in a little fry daddy. I like them crisp but not burnt. When I pulled the fries out after the recommended time, they were close to inedible. It happened quick too. I shook them and returned to them 5 minutes later, they were gone.\n\nI had better luck with fried chicken because I watched like a hawk. Just some chicken breast dredged in egg and breadcrumbs. These were done 7(!) minutes quicker than the book recommended temp and time. But they were delicious. Juicy, crispy like a healthier version of what I'd get accomplished in the fry daddy with just a tablespoon of oil instead of a half gallon.\n\nI've had similar experience with other meats and vegetables. It is also a rather large machine and a counter eater, so YMMV on whether it suits your kitchen.\n\nIn short, this is a good product that produces tasty food, but the instructions are not accurate in my experience. Experiment a bit and also guess lower than the expected time and you should be producing good food."},{"reviewerName":"Condor","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"So far, great","reviewDate":"October 16, 2018","reviewText":"My previous air fryer started to lose the enamel on the basket, not a good sign, so replacing it sounded like a good idea. This Ninja air fryer holds 4 quarts which is slightly larger than my previous one. I like to spread fries around more, the commercials always show full baskets with golden fries, but mine don't look anything like that if I put in that many.\n\nThis fryer has lots of functions including roasting and dehydrating. The dehydrate function had me laugh since I dehydrate in bulk. But maybe some leftover cilantro or parsley will work rather than watching it rot.\n\nI tested the unit's roasting function with an entire package of boneless skinless chicken thighs. They looked a bit pale after 15 minutes but were cooked through and incredibly juicy and tasty. I tested breaded shrimp on air fry and found them slightly overcooked at the preset level which I had knocked down to 10 minutes with no preheating. I will reduce that further for next time. They were nice and brown.\n\nCleanup is super easy as everything is nonstick. This means no metal utensils. I have tongs with silicone covered tips, so no problem there.\n\nThe unit is relatively quiet, just the fan that circulates the air is heard. I cannot comment on longivety but hope it will last a while.

I can never get a deep fryer to work right. My stuff either comes out squishy or over oily. I read the instructions closely and I just cant get it right. Then along came the Ninja that saved my life. It makes deep fryers obsolete for me at least. You get a big amount of space in which to fry your food. The food comes out tasting awesome and you can dehydrate stuff as well. All these combine to make a wonderful, easy to use, Air Fryer. On top of all that the price is fantastic.\n\nI was able to fry fries and a few other things easily. You follow the instructions and a while later you get crispy food. There is nothing every wrong with crispy food and it really does make you happy to eat it. The issue is and has always been the amount of oil in these wonderful tasting treats. This allows you to make healthy food without killing your insides.\n\nThis is an easy to use item.

I don't think you are really dropping wet type batter things in it like you do with oil ( like you aren't making traditional funnel cakes in this!) But it is wonderful for breaded types if items. It works with blowing hot air, kind of like a convection oven, but cheaper and portable. Frozen things (like fries) are great. I rarely ever bought those because I didn't have a deep fryer and didn't like them from my regular oven. They are great in here though. I also like it for heating up tortillas chips so they are warm and crunchy. We always buy extras now when we order Chipotle because they come out so good from this fryer.

So far, I pretty much love how well it works. I haven't tried dehydrating, yet, but I'm looking forward to that - I just didn't realize that process took 5+ hours to complete, so I'm waiting for when I can set aside a chunk of time to be around for all of it.\n\nI've cooked frozen french fries, pork tenderloins, and even a filet. They all turned out pretty darn awesome. I think that the fries were better than I'm used to because it's really easy to toss them during cooking, so they got more evenly cooked than when I put them in the oven. The tenderloins were cooked nice and evenly, but they taught me a lesson to measure the internal temperatures earlier...I was going by the suggested cooking times in the book, and they were about 30 degrees F hotter inside than required. Luckily not dried out at all, but I do suggest checking meat temperatures early on until you get a good feel for how this cooks. I did that with the filet, and my goodness, it was delicious. This fryer won't give that outer sear like when cooked on a grill or pan cooked, but it was nicely done all the way through.\n\nCleaning is pretty easy. The crisper plate was pretty sticky and oily after cooking the fries, but the great thing about the design is that you can just put soapy water into the basket and soak it along with the crisper plate. So far, they are still nicely non-stick. Only time will tell if that holds up, but at least when new, they clean really easily. They are also dishwasher safe, but I haven't done that, yet.\n\nProgramming the temperature and time is super simple. I might have missed it in the directions, but I didn't see any quick set buttons like some fryers have to just push a button for steak or fish or fries (or whatever). That's fine by me, though. It comes with a sticker on the side for those common things which recommended temperatures and times, and it takes all of five seconds to program it. There's no reference on the sticker for dehydrating, but the booklet details that out for various foods.\n\nI really like the design, too. The basket pulls out easily from the front, and the whole fryer just looks pretty sleek and cool to me.\n\nThe one thing that I don't like is how loud it is. You're not going to wonder if this is running. At all. My house isn't huge (~1500 square feet), but I can tell this is running anywhere that I am. It's definitely not painfully loud, and it isn't high pitched or anything. It's just loud enough that I don't want to try and watch TV while it's cooking. As this is my first air fryer, that might be normal for all of them...in which case, I'd have the same issue with all of them.\n\nIn conclusion, it is a bit loud when cooking, but the results so far for me have been very, very good. I'm really happy that I gave it a try, and I'll be using it a lot more."},{"reviewerName":"Magic Mike J","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Pretty nice appliance","reviewDate":"November 10, 2018","reviewText":"This is a pretty nice appliance. Uses mostly hot air to fry your foods, although if you want them to b really fried you do need to coat things with a little oil, but you use much less than if you were deep frying. I made some chicken breasts in it, lightly coated them with olive oil, then a mixture of lemon pepper, garlic powder and onion powder on both sides. Turned the thing on and 22 minutes later was enjoying nice crispy fried breasts.\n\nThe ceramic coating makes it easy to clean too. That's my biggest gripe with these 'convenience' appliances, they make things so easy but then hell to clean. This wasn't too bad, some hot soapy water and it cleaned right up. We also threw some cut up chunks of sweet potatoes in there and they also came out great. I will be using this for a lot of things."},{"reviewerName":"Justin Hyman","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Tiny Basket","reviewDate":"April 11, 2019","reviewText":"What is this?

You WILL use this. In fact I use mine every day, sometimes 2-3 times a day. I don't know how I lived without this. Ok, seriously...I LOVE my air fryer. I have the 4qt size. I have a family of three and feel this is just the right size for us even when I cook for a couple more people. I cook pretty much anything in here. My favorites are potatoes, potato chips, fish and stuffed mushrooms. I don't buy a lot of processed foods but have tried it for french fries once and it was delicious-without the greassiness of traditional. I will steam vegetables first them cook in the air fryer with a little seasoning. Different settings and temperature levels take a little getting used to. Join an online Air Fryer group and you will get a lot of tips and good ideas. To date I have sold 12 of these to friends, family and co-workers. This model comes with a wire rack. I use this to prevent loose items from blowing around in the air fryer and use it for cooking bacon. I have no issues with the fryer smelling up the house like a traditional fryer. I do however, STRONGLY recommend you place it in a spot that has proper ventilation in the back, because it gets really hot and will melt anything it is flush against. Also you will need to place it on something other than the counter or stove. I use a counter slab but a large tile works good too. This travels with me wherever I go, it has been amazing on trips, camping, Disney vacations and picnics. You will not regret this purchase. I do see some negative reviews about a smell of burning plastic. During your first use there will be a slight smell but once cleaned and used to cook for it will go away. If you feel like it smells you can always place a small bowl of white vinegar or bleach near the vent and bread under the basket. This will help reduce the smell and absorb the grease if there is any. It has replaced our toaster and toaster oven and has cut my stove use in half.Buy it, un-box it and use it! I was worried it would be like the instant pot that I was scared to use and when I did I got burned. This is your forever appliance!"},{"reviewerName":"Andrea Polk","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"More useful than expected","reviewDate":"July 21, 2019","reviewText":" When I received the Ninja Air Fryer as a gift I wasn't sure why I would want or need it. I had purchased a smaller air fryer of another brand for my daughter when she went to college, and she had told me how much she enjoyed food cooked in it, but still, the idea of another appliance to clutter my kitchen didn't appeal to me. Despite this, I glanced at the reviews on Amazon and thought it might be worth a try. I'm SO happy I decided to make space for this appliance!\n\nWhat I like about the Ninja Air Fryer:\n\n1. So easy to use! Pre-heat for 3 minutes, put your food in, push the appropriate setting and go. The Quick Start guide is very helpful and clearly written.\n\n2. So easy to clean! The cooking bin and fryer plate are Teflon coated and clean-up is super quick.\n\n3. The food produced in the air fryer tastes great! I've made tempura shrimp (from frozen) in 10 minutes what was better than in the traditional fryer - tastier and crisper - with no oil added which makes it healthier. I also used the dehydrator setting to make beef jerky that turned out amazing. I had planned on putting it away, but so far it's being used each day so it stays on the counter.\n\n------------------------------\n\nThis appliance is perfect for two people. It is kind of big and it makes some noise (blower to vent heat), but it is really useful.\n\nThe Ninja Air Fryer would be ideal for...\n\n1. People who don't have a lot of cooking experience, but like to eat.\n\n2. Dorm or small apartment kitchens where appliances need to do double or triple duty.\n\n3. For cooks who like fried food crunch, but hate the mess that oil creates and/or want a healthier alternative.\n\nNOTE: Tried cooking frozen mozzarella sticks in the fryer and came out with a mess as cheese escaped, but the outside was crispy! You may have to monitor certain foods more carefully to get the desired results.\n\n----------------------------------\n\nI'm truly amazed at how the Ninja Air Fryer can produce crispy, tasty food with little effort. The cleaning of the appliance is super easy and other than its considerable size, I love it. Well worth the money!\n\n---------------"},{"reviewerName":"Stephanie","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Enjoyable and reliable compared to some of the competition","reviewDate":"March 31, 2019","reviewText":"We are coming from a NuWave fryer which was nothing but issues, breaks and failures. We've had this for 4 months so far which is 3 months longer than the first part broke on the nuwave fryer. We've had no issues with parts breaking/melting. This fryer is sooooooo much easier to clean than our previous. The only gripe I have is that the capacity is a bit smaller than our last. On the flip side we find this one is far superior in it's evenness and quality of warming. It takes much less time to get a much better result with this fryer. The other thought I have about it is it requires a \"preheat\" so we run it for 1-2 minutes before tossing in food. There really should be a button for warming up since it's a requirement for functioning. Even with that additional time to pre-heat, it still cooks more quickly than our previous unit. It's equally intuitive to use and we're extremely happy with it so far."},{"reviewerName":"Georgia Peach","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Excellent Air Fryer. I am hooked on air frying now. Glad I chose the Ninja Air Fryer 🌟","reviewDate":"August 5, 2019","reviewText":"I just recently purchased this item. It was my first air fryer purchase. I researched and read about so many and I did not want to spend big bucks on another brand, which is highly rated. I personally like the quality of Ninja products. I got the Ninja on sale at a local store for $99.00. The regular price was $129.99. I am so impressed with this air fryer that I can hardly wait until their new larger air fryer hits the market. I have also used the Philips Air Fryer, which, by the way is awesome too. The Ninja cooks awesome crispy chicken wings and fries. The Ninja seems to cook fast, so be sure to check on the food in between the total recommended cooking time. The one I purchased works perfect. I am on the waiting list for their new indoor grill/air fryer, and the larger 5.5 quart Air Fryer. They will be on Amazon, August 26, 2019.\nI am so excited. I also own the Ninja Magic Bullet Smoothie maker. It is awesome, so I purchased one for my daughter too."},{"reviewerName":"MommyRN","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"What the SMELL?!?","reviewDate":"August 19, 2019","reviewText":"Everyone told me I “had to have one” of these air fryer gadgets, so when my birthday came around I asked my hubby to get me one. Honestly, I could still live without one. I’m not someone that fries many foods to begin with so naturally, I don’t air fry many foods either. I used to do fries in the oven. Now I do them in the air fryer, and they definitely taste much better. I had to adjust the suggested time though. They suggested somewhere around 20 minutes I think for frozen fries. I checked them at 15 and they were so hard and crispy they weren’t edible. After drastically reducing the time, they came out great. I also like to fry the frozen breaded okra. I was excited to pop them in the air fryer for a healthier alternative. I was sadly disappointed with how these came out. Not good at all. I’ve done corn dogs and tater tots that have come out great. I’ve also reheated nachos from a restaurant. These came out better than if I had done them in the microwave as usual. I’m sure there are other things that I need to try that I would love, but these are the things I’ve done so far.\nOk, the bad. As some others have said there is a strong odor that permeates from this thing while it’s in use. I haven’t been able to put my finger on what it is, but another reviewer mentioned a rubber or plastic smell and I think that’s accurate. I thought it was just the “newness” burning off when I first bought it, but it’s just as strong now. Just for reference, rubber/plastic smells don’t usually bother me, but this one does a little. However, my seven year old daughter HATES the way it smells when I use it. She won’t even come in the room while I’m using it. I have to say, the smell has deterred me from using it when otherwise it would have been the better cooking option."},{"reviewerName":"mcair","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Better than NuWave + ignore the \"smell\" commenters","reviewDate":"August 11, 2019","reviewText":"Bought at Kohls with a 30% off coupon to replace an 18-month old NuWave 3qt that stopped working (in fairness it was used heavily, not too disappointed). I was leery of changing brands since I'd had success with the NuWave, but after a good 20-min max-temp burn-in this unit was given a workout. I use these machines to prepare side dishes and snack foods. Breaded chicken or pork chops occasionally.\n\nPro's\n- Super easy to use\n- Easy clean, the ceramic food plate cleans up much easier than the NuWave mesh basket\n- Significantly better crisping action than NuWave and I mean WAY better. Night-and-day better. This means reduced cooking time and temperatures, so watch it carefully until you get a sense of how much time/temp. to use for each food type. Waffle & sweet potato fries come out super-crispy and hot.\n- Worth every penny. Keep your main oven for turkeys and other large, slow-cooked meat. Everything else goes in the air-fryer.\n\nCons\n- No auto-turnoff when basket is removed. This could be a safety hazard. Pause cooking to inspect cooking progress. Not a showstopper.\n\nI had zero problems with any \"burning smell\" reported by others. I was concerned since the basket insert has rubber stoppers that hold it in place, I couldn't believe they would stand up to the heating but they do. Wash/rinse thoroughly, then run at max temp for 20 mins, preferably outside the house and you're good to go."},{"reviewerName":"Healthy","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Not even close to the taste of an oil fryer","reviewDate":"June 29, 2019","reviewText":"I bought this air fryer from Walmart in April of 2019 based on positive reviews from Amazon. We had an oil fryer that was destroyed when left on a stove.\nSo I after reading many reviews of various fryers I bought into the lie that an air \"fryer\" would make french fries taste just as good as an oil fryer.\nFirst this isn't a fryer but a high temp oven. This WILL dry out anything you are cooking unless you brush vegetable oil on the food beforehand. Which of course defeats the purpose of having an air \"fryer\".\nI finally had enough and gave my air \"fryer\" to one of my older kids. I'm going back to an oil fryer.\nDon't buy into the positive reviews. If you want to eat healthy then don't eat french fries."},{"reviewerName":"Alphonsel","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great First Air Fryer","reviewDate":"March 10, 2019","reviewText":"Disclaimer: Did Not Buy On Amazon\n\nFor a few months, like everybody else, it’s hard escaping the advertising for these things. Sounds like an incredible idea, and if it works as stated, figured could not go wrong. Main concern being I would use it twice and more junk under the counter.\n\nI did very little research, but I figured a bigger size like this one would be better than too small. Also, I did not want to buy a cheap, unknown brand that would not do this type of product any justice. The Ninja looked nice, and I picked it up for $80. The prices on this product fluctuate wildly. Some stores retail it for $117, and It is certainly not worth that. Most are lower. But the store I bought mine at (dreaded Walmart) raised their price from $80 to $89 the day after I bought it. It’s a decent appliance, but out of the $80 or so price range, I would have gone with something else.\n\nMy first time usage results: much preferred over deep frying. This product works quick, and no kidding, it gets pretty hot inside. Yet outside remains cool. The included recommended cooking times, in my opinion, are dangerous if you blindly follow them. At the very least, you will have burnt food. With that in mind, I generally set it for just over half of the time recommended. You have to watch it until the point of feeling comfortable with the times you set. But in my opinion, once ideal cook times are figured out, it works well and everything tastes great.\n\nOne more item of note: Wattage used. Many of these air fryers pull in north of 1700 watts, and that was a concern of mine. My home is over 30 years old. My electrical system handles 1500 watt space heaters no problem, but going higher than that for any length of time scares me. This product draws about 1500 watts, and upon using it, I really don’t see how more wattage than that would really be needed. It works fast, and will burn your food to a crisp if you let it.\n\nClean up could not be easier, and that alone will ensure I use this fairly often.\n\nSome reviews mention a strong odor upon first usage. Not here, maybe a second or two that you could expect from any new appliance heating up for the first time. Smell quickly disappeared and never came back.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: A good appliance to have. Not sure if it’s the best, but works well enough that I don’t care. This will definitely stay on my top counter. Recommended."},{"reviewerName":"SW","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Should Have Got One Sooner","reviewDate":"December 12, 2018","reviewText":"Had this for a week so far.

The pan and the heating plate are very easy to clean (more or less a quick rinse) and the food cooks fast and well. Based on the 2 we tried, get a product like this Ninja - with a solid non-sick plate that sits inside (and lifts out with) the pan, not one with a wire-type basket.\n\nSo far cooked:\n\n1. Chicken Breast (marinated and dry seasoned)\n2. Chicken Tikka (used the steel grill to do the onions and peppers for send half of cooking)\n3. Sausages\n4. Chicken Drumsticks\n5.

Maybe because my love for french fries 😩 and I really dislike baked fries 😖.

Okay, back to the real deal!\n\nThis air fryer is amazing, you might want to be a little careful though because their estimated times for cooking is about 5-10mins too long. Also, please pre-heat for the mentioned 3mins I’ve had a lot better results from pre-heating.\n\nOnly con about this thing is the first time use. of course rinse it out. Please start it on the highest temp for 20-30mins so that it can air out what ever that horrible smell it initial produces.

The temperature and time is all programmable through the digital interface, which a lot have the old school rotating dial type. Included is a recipe book with a lot of great ideas. I used the jerky recipe and added a couple other varieties (jalapeno, hickory smoked, Caribbean jerk, whiskey) and they all turned out AMAZING! The pot is somewhat small, so you can only cook one lb of jerky (makes about 6 oz dry jerky) per batch. But for wings or fries, it's super awesome!
