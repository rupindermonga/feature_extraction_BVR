I received it as a Christmas gift and used it up until Monday of this week, when it suddenly shut off. The warranty is only good for 60 days, so knowing I would probably not get any help from their customer service, which I sadly found to be true, I looked up the problem in the manual. Under \"Troubleshooting\" in the manual it said the fryer probably overheated, to unplug it and let it cool off a while. I did exactly as it said and left it unplugged overnight. The next morning I plugged it back into the outlet and turned it on. It blinked like it was going to work, then it shut off and never started again. It seems that the whole idea of this oven is a great idea, but the company does a very poor job of making it. I think anyone that buys it should be aware of the 60 day warranty, and understand if anything happens after that time,the company will not stand by its product!"},{"reviewerName":"Joan Dahlen","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Plastic smell!","reviewDate":"July 2, 2018","reviewText":"This air fryer must have plastic inside because it sells of plastic.

That's right, only two months.","reviewDate":"November 28, 2018","reviewText":"Nothing says, \"this is a complete piece of junk\" more than a two month warranty from the people that built the device. If they don't believe in their product - why should you? Let's be honest, you can buy perishable food products today that have a longer warranty that this overpriced, TV hyped, and poorly built product. And the vast majority of the people that buy this device will never notice that the 60 day return policy is also the warranty until after the purchase because it is so well hidden is the the hype and fine print. While this is a highly unethical practice, no one is calling them out on it - but I intend to.\n\nAnd the real shame is, you will need a good warranty because these units have a nasty habit of failing in the first year. But don't take my word for it, just look at the feedback from many of the buyers and do a few online searches. People are very angry about this situation.\n\nMy unit lasted 6 months before it failed hard and the manufacturer does not supply parts or have a repair facility. So that works out to roughly $16 a use (not including - time, electricity, or food cost) if we used it 10 times in 6 months at a purchase price of $167 before it goes in the trash. Who in their right mind would consider that any kind of value or a logical purchase? Not to mention $167 buys quite a bit of food cooked by someone else.\n\nIf you need an air fryer, buy one with an actual 1 year or longer warranty. Most reputable manufacturers will offer them and you can find those better products here on Amazon"},{"reviewerName":"Sam Horn","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Do not purchase.","reviewDate":"July 3, 2018","reviewText":"Junk.

I have a tribest brand blender that has been a workhorse for about 15 yrs with no problem so I didn't think anything of the short 60 day warranty they offer. The food I have cooked in it turns out great and it's pretty easy to clean. That's the end of the positives.\n\nFirst the drop pan on the bottom started chipping. I looked online and saw it was a common problem so I called the company. I was just past my 60 day warranty, so they wouldn't even replace it. All they offered was how to purchase a new one. Why would I purchase another faulty piece? Anyhow I looked some more online and I guess most people cover it in foil, so I decided it wasn't that big of a deal and continued to use it\nNow I've had it about 5 months and used it maybe 15 times and the fan has stopped. I don't keep it under a cabinet like some people so there's lots of ventilation when I use it. After last time, know to not even bother with customer service again so I again go online to see what's going on. I guess it is yet another common problem. Thankfully my husband is very handy and I think we can fix it.

But we decided to try it. For fried food we've made French fries, tator tots, and a hash brown casserole. Rotisserie we've made roast beef (a round eye roast) and a whole chicken. Everything came out perfect. I normally don't fry foods in oil, I use the oven which takes a long time. The air fryer cooks foods in almost half the time. I'm thinking that's a savings right there on electricity. The rotisserie is amazing, I thought the meats would be dry. Not at all, very juicy! So easy to use.. Our microwave gives us kiosk instructions. The air fry gives icons of what button to press. 😀 If you love frozen fried foods, this is the way to go. No more fry daddy's. Just put it in the air fryer. Taste just as good. I saw a review about the dehydrator. My cook book says it takes sometimes 24 hours. Well that's quicker than hanging jalapenos in the window for a few of weeks.. Just saying lol.. Everything it comes with seems to be heavy duty. I've put everything in the dishwasher, except the bottom plate I hand wash it. I really can't see anything wrong with this product. I just thought it would be a gadget at first but now it's something I definitely will use on a regular basis. If it's not working return it. I don't know how many times I got a dud product..

Plus for this unit over others I investigated are it's ability to do multiple racks of dehydration, air frying, or a rotisserie. Others with just a drawer were not able to do all of that. Rotisserie is incredible. Where it lacks is the three recipe books. They are weak, but do get you started with ideas. Try some but expect to surf the internet or even buy a few books on air frying. Cleaning can require a little work depending on what you cook. Unit has lots if preset settings for foods but you soon realize none of them are optimal to the best results.

As you can see it lifted the coating off of the pan! I find it’s too difficult to store everything that came with the unit and very cumbersome to take the time to use!

The bottom drip tray is a fail. after about ten uses the non stick surface wears off with just cloth washing. All of the pre-set buttons are pretty much a waste. You'll end up setting a temp and time and checking with a temp probe for done. I don't use any of the presets. The front door is a mess. The clear panels are not sealed so water gets in-between them as well as other gunk. The slides for the trays are difficult to align, have to say I don't know how you fix that but if they really want to make an improvement the side slides should be removable for cleaning. As it its you can only kinda get them clean. Key one is make sure you totally dry anything you want to cook.

I was told that that message meant the internal circuit was broken, and I was out of luck since the warranty was only sixty days. $150.00 for six months of use. I think the sixty-day warranty is probably indicative of its quality. They don't expect it to have a very long lifespan."},{"reviewerName":"Dustin s","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Don’t waste your money","reviewDate":"June 19, 2018","reviewText":"If you like to flip your food every 5 minutes so it won’t burn this is for you! The whole selling point is not having to flip food due to the moving air. I bought the oven on Father’s Day, and just two days later the rotisserie feature does not work anymore. I used it to cook one piece of chicken and it worked well for that. Will burn the top rack of onion rings and leave the bottom soggy. The mesh basket worked well for French fries, while it worked. But these French fries will not look like they do on the infomercial. They look like they came out of a plain old oven, brown and puffed up.

At this point I should have contacted the manufacture because I really didn’t care about having a light, until I went to clean it 2 plus months later. I found a crack in the interior wall of the oven (probably why the light didn’t work), it must have been dropped. But when I call customer care they told me I did not buy the extended warranty so there was nothing they could do about it. I said what i have had it for only three months. Well come to find out it’s warranty is only good for 60 days, what kind of product is only Warranteed for only 60 days.

I watched several videos on YouTube and got up to speed.\n\nI cooked two dishes at same time. First I dipped chicken drumsticks in butter and then coated with grated parmesean cheese, then put mesh rack, which I'd sprayed with cooking spray, in highest slot. I cooked them for 16 minutes at 370, which is the automatic chicken speed.\n\nI also had sliced Chinese eggplant rounds, which I coated in melted butter and topped with grated parmesean.\n\nWhen the chicken had 16 minutes on top rack, I pulled it out, it was already browning, turned it over and put in in the lowest rack. I did not want chicken drippings on top of the eggplant.\n\nI then put the rack with the eggplant in the highest slot and cooked for 10 minutes. Wow were they beautiful but almost done so I kept them out for 10 minutes while chicken cooked more. Then I turned eggplant rounds over, and cooked another 8.\n\nChicken was absolutely delicious. I was just knocked out by how moist and tender and crispy it was. Eggplant was also wonderful.\n\nI figured anything advertised on tv would be just awful. I was wrong. I had sprayed all the removable parts with cooking spray so a bit of a soak and a bit of a scrub with kitchen brush cleaned the mesh racks. The teflon coated drip tray is a breeze.\n\nI'll take photos next meal I make.\n\nI'm very intimidated by the rotisserie function, btw, though I saw a gentlemen on YouTube using it like a breeze. But I don't much see the point. Why not just set a whole chicken on the lowest rack and bake it?\n\nUpdate. Nite 2. Baked whole chicken. 45 minutes. Delicious. Mascarpone cheese mixed with butter and olive oil stuffed under skin. I could have done that in oven.

I tried everything, I unplugged and plugged back in a bunch of times, checked to see if the everything was placed back correctly and it still would not work.\n\nWhen I would replug, the Airfryer electronic section would light up and beep and then turn off and the internal light of the air fryer would stay on even though the door was closed.

First, it does work really well, you can fit a bunch of stuff at one time, and it mostly cooks every greatly. But in their rush to be the first with the Oven style they have some design flaws. like the trays are a pain to get in and out especially when they are hot. Then the Drum that comes with it breaks very easy making it so that you cant use it. The rotisserie is awesome if you get a chicken smaller than 4 lbs and can truss it really really good. Actually had a problem finding whole chickens under 5 lbs that weren't Cornish Hens. The Trays are really easy to clean if you let them soak if you get some parchment paper made for air fryers they make it non stick and easy cleanup. I have made jerky a couple times that came out pretty good. Overall i could go on and on but im sure there are better reviewers than me. I would buy this again, ( if price was lower ) but id probably go with one of the newer models that fixed most of these issues."},{"reviewerName":"Cabincreek","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"He died last night.

IT IS A FIRE HAZARD!!!","reviewDate":"February 1, 2019","reviewText":"We bought the XL about 3 months ago from a TV infomercial. I don't care if this is an Amazon review. People need to know this thing is dangerous! Product arrived in a timely manner and well packaged. The $100 in free \"grocery\" coupons isn't more than 50 cents off coupons for mainly non-food items but I wasn't surprised because this is what most companies would offer. The door is flimsy. Don't sneeze while it's open because it may break off! Washed all parts by hand and the finish on the drip pan washed off in spots. Hard to tell what some of the pictures are for the options and most don't make sense. 1st time I used it was to make a chicken recipe that was in their \"cook book\". It turned out GREAT! Crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. One of the features I was most looking forward to was the dehydrator so we excitedly gave it a try. My husband dehydrated some bananas and sweet potatoes for the dog. Sweet potatoes turned out perfect but the bananas were a bust! They never dried and only stuck to the rack. OK.. no bananas. I can live with that. We then tried (multiple times) to make french fries. Not one single time did they turn out crispy no matter what we did. Less than 1 month old and food began to stick to the rack. When I wash the rack (by hand) finish would wash off. 1 month later, It stopped turning on. It now takes us SEVERAL attempts to get the thing to run. Sometimes it doesn't turn off. If I open the door it will just keeps on running. When it does run it doesn't crisp. It takes twice as long to cook now than it did 1 month prior. It no longer holds temperature long enough to dehydrate anything. Not only does it not turn on when we want it to, sometimes it will actually just start running all of a sudden on its own. Last night we were watching tv in the livingroom and all of a sudden I saw light shining from the kitchen and heard it running. There's only my husband and I who live in the house and we were both in the living room. We either have a ghost or this thing is a fire hazard.\n\nThis item is a flimsy piece of junk that's going to burn someone's house down one day.

This in turn prevented the unit from turning on. After manipulating the door I realized that if you lifted up on the door handle the light would go out and the unit could be operated. SO I started shoving thick place mats under the front bottom of the door essentially forcing the door up and then I could operate it. I decided to return the unit because frankly I liked it when it worked AND the same problem is now showing up with this unit. Both occurrences seemed to manifest itself after using it for 4-5 times so I'm thinking it is a heat related deformation causing the interlock on the door to not throw far enough to get the permissive.

Anyway, when I went to use it the 4th time the unit would not turn on, power came on but it would not run. I went over it real well and found that the door was not closing properly i.e. it was hanging or should I say dropping down just a hair which would not allow the unit to turn on because the safety switch in the door would not engage. If I lifted up slightly on the door it would run. The door hinges are CHEAP junk poorly designed! I would guess for reading many of these reviews that may have been issue with most of the units failing to run....you cannot tell by eye the door looks perfectly fine!

Only 3 racks. Its says it comes with 5 in the parts list but you really can't fit more than 3 in there with food on them anyway. They are only about 8-9 inches wide so you can only make small/personal sized pizzas. It only makes enough food for one or two people at a time. The rotisserie is so weak it will stop working if you have more than 4 pounds of food or anything barely touches the drip tray. The pictures on the box show the machine holding much more than it actually can. The rotisserie is horrible for chicken. Even if you find a chicken small enough to fit in the thing and truss it tight, it will still burn the skin while leaving the inside undercooked. It is very difficult to clean. About half the machine is taken up by the heating element. For such a large heating element, they should just make a bigger oven and make it worth the space it takes up. As others have mentioned, the parts are cheap, the pan peels and the warranty is just long enough for this thing to break down after the 5-7 uses it will last you. Conceptually a good idea. I wish it was larger and better made."},{"reviewerName":"Nibor Diva Tsidun","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Shuts off during cooking and door doesn't know it is closed","reviewDate":"January 24, 2019","reviewText":"First time we cooked frozen French fries, it ran the whole time. Next time it shut off 3 minutes early, next time 7 minutes early. Once it shut off, forget it. We don't know why and are concerned about trying fries again, or anything that needs to be cooked for about 20 minutes. Another time, we opened it just to put in a tray, when the door was closed, the light would not shut off, the machine would not turn on. We unplugged it. Now we think we know why it won't work. The door system is so bad that the machine thinks the door is open even when it has been closed firmly and several times to make sure. Now we are working on trying to get the door to understand that it is closed. We really do like the machine when we can use it.\nIn my original review I gave it 4 stars, but that was when we could use it. First review was: We have had this for a couple weeks. The first thing we noticed was the lack of a basic 'how to' cookbook for simple items. It does come with three cook books; maybe useful if you like those types of food. The trays often fall on one side or the other, because there is so little on the sides to hold the trays. It does a nice job of toasting bagels and cooking frozen French fries. We are also happy because it nicely reheats leftover food brought home from going out to dinner. No more soggy microwaved leftovers. You just get to figure out how long and what temp to reheat at."},{"reviewerName":"Mary Busch","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Beware of fire!","reviewDate":"July 25, 2018","reviewText":"I loved this oven until the thing started on fire!

I actually bought it from another place, but I wanted to leave a review here because I knew it would be seen here more widely. I put it outside on the porch to run it for the first time to get that \"new\" smell that comes from the first use of appliances out. It smelled strongly of plastic. I let it cool and hand washed everything. After it dried, I tried three more cycles, and it continuously smelled of plastic. I think probably because the fan and heating element are encased above the oven space, so when it heats, it must be heating up the plastic. I'm not a scientist, so I don't know if chemicals are being distributed to the food, but it was enough of a turn off for me to return it and look for another type of air fryer. I did like that the trays were metal and not coated with non-stick coating as so many other reviews on the machines that are coated say that the coating flakes off."},{"reviewerName":"Chuck","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Doesn't last - fan quit","reviewDate":"August 12, 2018","reviewText":"I bought this fryer as a mother's day gift this year..

We loved it! Used it at least 4-5 times per week, and it worked well. After 1 week the interior light stopped working, an annoyance, but the fryer still worked, so we continued to use it. In February, it started smelling like burnt plastic, so we stopped using it until my husband could look at it. One day in late February, my son plugged it in and it started spewing electrical sparks from underneath. I would have to reach over the unit to unplug it (likely lighting myself on fire) so i brushed it off the counter, knocking it to the floor and causing a dent in the plastic top. It unplugged and stopped spewing fire, but Walmart would not take it back because it was purchased November 20th (>90 days). I found an online return center from the PowerAirFryer company, but because we didn’t buy it directly from them, we were required to pay to send it back to them, and they would have 90 days to “decide on a reimbursement amount”. Since it had a dent now, i did not want to pay $30 for shipping to be told it was not covered.\n\nLong-story-short: Do not buy this unit unless you don’t care if it only lasts 2-3 months or catches on fire.

As a sucker for all kinds of kitchen equipment I was so excited to try this product. I have a small kitchen and love the idea of equipment doing double duty. As an experienced cook I know the value in reading the manuals prior to setting up and using so I was careful to follow the manufacturers instructions in using for the first time. I was aware from other reviews that their could be an odor that needs to burn off. I wasn't prepared for the stench that came off this oven. It stuck up not only my small kitchen but my entire home. I opened all the windows in 40 degree weather but I swear it was so bad I still smelt it coming off the unplugged and repackaged machine a day later. Needless to say it went back.

Grow up people, and take some personal responsibility for your inability to use this appliance correctly. I meal prep and this appliance works great. I use it daily to make 3-4 servings of chicken or fish. Both of those two pre-set functions work perfectly. I pull the meat straight out of the freezer, rub it with a little olive oil to get the seasonings to stick, hit the preset button, and come back to a delicious perfectly cooked protein. I have used the basket to cook shrimp. It did take longer than the setting, but it was my fault for stuffing the basket too full. I used the skewers to make rotisserie pork chops. There was definitely a learning curve with the skewers and the way they lock in. The rotisserie functionality took some trial and error to get everything figured out. After I got it figured out though, it worked like a champ. I also made beef jerky with it. Again it was my fault for not buying a thin enough cut of meat to make the jerky. It came out great but took twice as long because of the thickness of the meat not due to the functionality of the machine. Overall this appliance is by far the most valuable appliance in my kitchen.

I make pork chops, steak, chicken, beef jerky, even prime rib. The rotisserie function made the best prime rib I’ve ever had in my life. This machine is truly incredible. However the is not built to last. I have only had mine for about a year and within the first 6 months, the door would just unlatch and stop cooking on it’s on. So I’ve been rigging it by placing things in the cracks under the door to keep the door latches. I would buy the bigger one if I knew it would last.

The first time I wanted to try something simple. I filled the basket according to the directions with some frozen fries. The book stated to cook between 16-18 minutes. After the specified time they were not fully cooked, so I just chalked this up to a difference in individual fryers and just added 3 more min. They were almost done. The next attempt was a rotisserie chicken. Putting the chicken on the rotisserie was a royal pain. Then when I loaded it into the fryer, I found out the center piece is too short. When attempting to engage the drive on the left side, the right side will fall out of the track. If I just barely engage the drive on the left the rotisserie will slip out of the drive end after about 30-40 seconds. I finally gave up and cooked my chicken in the oven.

They have no sort of support team to help you try to fix it, they will not send replacement if out of warranty, basically they took the $159 and sold a piece of crap in a box that works one maybe 2 times, and didn't care, I never even got the chance to open and use any of the accessories that came with it."},{"reviewerName":"Amy","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Patience is a virtue","reviewDate":"December 31, 2018","reviewText":"I recently purchased this unit for my husband for Christmas thinking it would be easy for him to prepare a meal. This was not the case. It took over 2 hours to make chicken fingers and French fries for a family of 4. The clean up was more than two baking sheets in the regular oven would have been. We had an issue every time we tried to put the rotating basket it. I moved the unit to cool off and when I wiped off my counter the hot dish water steamed off the counter top. I am hoping it doesn't bubble up when it cools down. I am hoping we experience greater ease the next time. The one good thing though I was able to purchase the unit at our local WalMart store for about $45 less than the on TV price."},{"reviewerName":"Jcaudell","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Don't waste your money!","reviewDate":"October 15, 2019","reviewText":"First if you cook with 2 racks the one on top will get real brown before the second rack. The racks are so hard to clean especially if you make the cheese sticks and the cheese melts out of the stick. The french fries take twice as long as it recommends the basket is hard to get in until you get it figured out. The dehydrator takes days for do jerky maybe not that long but a day and a night and it still didn't dry it good. I have found more bad than good with this oven. If I had of kept my box it came in I'd have shipped it back before the 30 days was up. I read it cost 80 dollars to send back don't know if its true or not.

One of the reasons I chose this model was the dehydrator feature. However, for most of the recipes in the recipe book included, the instructions say to set the temperature at 125F and cook for 6 hours. First of all, the lowest temperature that the oven will go is 150F and the longest time for the timer is 1 hour. So, something is amiss. Also, I tried to use the rotisserie basket and followed instructions for putting it into place. It was a difficult maneuver and then did not rotate.

Forty minutes later they were perfectly cooked. Do keep in mind that cooking in this oven will take longer than conventional frying, but that is the compromise for fat free cooking.\nI next used it to toast a hamburger bun, which was evenly toasted in under four minutes.

I have one of the earlier model air fryers and have been very satisfied with it, but was impressed by this models features. The first thing I found out after getting it is that the rack height is very important for the cooking times set. After a little trial and error, however, it's not difficult to figure out. This thing is excellent for frying steaks and porkchops. Juicy and tender. The best thing I found with this unit is making french fries in the rotating basket. Walmart sells frozen french fries called \"fast food french fries\". Made in this basket they come out very close to McDonald's fries. Crispy on the outside and tender inside. I've not tried that dehydrator or the rotisserie yet, but I plan on making some jerky. It's also great for frozen small pizza.\n\nMy only negative comment would be that it makes a mess to clean up, but I guess that's to be expected."},{"reviewerName":"Carrie S.","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"This Product has Lowered My Electric Bills by a Third!","reviewDate":"April 15, 2018","reviewText":"I simply LOVE this product.

I've also noticed that my electric bills have been substantially lower since my purchase of the item as I never use my oven anymore.\nIt cooks the best chicken wings and fried chicken without the extra grease. I skin the chicken and flour with seasoned flour, mist it lightly with corn oil or olive oil and Voila! Perfect Fried Chicken in about 15-20 minutes. I love the trays so I can cook more at one time.

I had an air fryer before but the bowl type, and almost didn’t use it cause I didn’t find it was practical. I love this one cause it’s like a mini oven and I can actually look at whatever’s inside cooking cause of the glass door and the light, SUPER PRACTICAL! Plus, it fits a lot more than the bowl type. It’s easy to use, super easy to clean cause the door is detachable, and you can cook literally anything in there.\n\nISSUE: I read some reviews before buying about technical issues and the thing not working after a few uses. Mine still works after about a month, and been using it almost everyday. BUT, sometimes it won’t turn on because when I put the door back on it doesn’t detect it, and I have to take it off and put it back on a few times for it to work.

I wanted to replace my Nuwave 10Qt. The design looked better and space utilization looked more efficient. And these held true. In fact, the design is pretty user friendly, air racks plentiful, and capacity is great. HOWEVER, I wanted to note 2 items just to provide some additional information about his unit.\n\n--> SMELL. This unit had an electrical/plastic burning smell, and no matter how long I baked empty at 400F to burn it out, it didn't. Others noted this as well. Not sure how many units had this, but mine and several others had this.\n--> HEAT on bottom. I measured the heat on the base to be >200F (hot air exiting the unit), blowing on the counter (now I understand why someone said their Corian had cracked!), and the sides are at <measured> ~150F (too hot to touch and move until it cools down).\n\nThese factors should be stated with high warning marks in any documentation, but I didn't see something that would provide an good enough, and emphatic warning about the heat because anything over 110-120F might cause some burn (or how to get rid of that smell).\n\nAlso, I presume the 8QT design is the same. And finally, there appears to be an updated version (On Amazon) Power 'Elite', which may have cured these issues."},{"reviewerName":"J Mays","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Five Stars","reviewDate":"June 22, 2018","reviewText":"Work great"},{"reviewerName":"Gwen","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Healthy eating made easy.","reviewDate":"January 12, 2018","reviewText":"I am in love with this fryer!

However, I figured I would give it a week or so to see if the odor and taste would disappear. I researched online and did wipe down the inside with some vinegar and lemon and let it run at 400 for about 30 minutes. I repeated the same the next day. I also left it stored with the glass door open while trying to get rid of the smell. Thankfully, the odor and taste finally disappeared and it was all love from there! This is a great little appliance and so versatile! I’ve cooked meat, vegetables, corn on the cob, etc and everything turns out perfectly! It holds a really good amount of food and I just love having the rotisserie. I would definitely recommend but remind everyone that you are going to have to wait out the plastic smell for about 6 or 7 uses. Also, non-stick spray works perfectly on the cooking racks and rotisserie basket. No sticking at all."},{"reviewerName":"The Sasquatch","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"I bought this for my wife's birthday from Samclub, ...","reviewDate":"June 18, 2018","reviewText":"I bought this for my wife's birthday from Samclub, she used it the same day.

I just took it out of the box and didn't even bother to cook with it. After reading several reviews about the drip pan flaking paint, I can see how that would happen. The coating seems poor quality but I figured I could get around that by just using a piece of foil (which would be my recommendation if you DO purchase this).\n\nMy biggest complaint and the reason I put this all right back in the box is that besides the trays, grabber tool, skewers (and parts to use them), and rotating basket, this is so much cheap plastic I question how long it would last. The door literally falls off when you try to open it. I assume it was designed this way so you can clean it but it's not a good design at all. The slots that hold the racks are plastic. The instructions say to use the grabber tool to remove items while hot. I just cannot fathom how this flimsy tool is sufficient enough to remove any of the accessories WITH food on them without causing the potential for complete disaster.\n\nI wanted to love this thing, really, but I just couldn't get over how cheap it feels. Now having read more reviews, I see that I'm not the only one with the opinions I have.

Had I known how much of a pain this device was, I never would have gotten it. The main issue is its false advertising. What I mean is, the appliances are advertised to do more than they can. Example, directions and photos show the kabob being full. However, when following the instructions, the kabobs fall apart while in the air fryer because the device is too small to accommodate skewers with meat on them. Also, the rotisserie is a rip off. It says a 4 lb. chicken, if you go one ounce over that 4 lb limit, the chicken is too big to rotate. Third, the rotating basket can turn out some of the most disgusting sides. The phrase \"turd okra\" will never leave my vocabulary. At this point, the device is nothing but a dissatisfaction and will likely end up in my shed where it will remain until I gift it to someone I don't like."},{"reviewerName":"rj","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Nothing but trouble","reviewDate":"July 8, 2018","reviewText":"First one lasted 6 weeks, just quit.

I’m a sucker for the “but wait! There’s more!” commercials. I’ve had a few weeks now and cooked several things that all required adjustments to. My steak fries took forever and a day to crisp up and taste just like oven fries. I laid them flat on the racks and I was less than impressed. I think I’ll try the rotisserie and spray my fries with Pam next time - and use crinkle cut or pixie. I also made salmon packed in foil with lemon, onion, garlic, spinach leaves, and dill and it was over cooked but still tasty. The chicken wings were crispy but the heat sucked the juice right out. I cooked shrimp in the rotis and that turned out perfect as did my toasted ravioli which actually had the fried effect. My frozen pizza had a funky after taste but it did crisp up. My rolls burned and after all of that, I feel that my toaster oven is more controllable. I’ll keep tinkering with it and see what happens.\n\nPROs:\nPreset settings\nFried foods do tend to have a fried effect less the oil\nEasy to clean\nThe multiple racks do hold an entire back of fries\n\nCONs:\nNot a heck of a lot of room between racks\nTakes up a lot of real estate on the counter\nWidth is lacking for the larger pizzas\nCooking times are way off\nHeat setting is off by about 5-8 degrees"},{"reviewerName":"James Donovan","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Suggest one not purchase","reviewDate":"January 30, 2019","reviewText":"Had item for 7 months - fan which distributes heat became dislodged & fell against the fan protection grate.

We cook a lot of chicken nuggets and frozen pizza as well as reheat leftovers. This air fryer has blown away our expectations.\nFirst of all, it cooks FAST. On the average 25% faster than the cook times on the instructions, even though it only goes up to 400°. I would advise you keep a close eye on your food or it will burn. It also makes things CRISPY. Even leftovers reheat almost to brand-new.\nWe typically only use one rack as I don't see how you can expect something to cook 3 layers and be crispy. The rotisserie fry basket is amazing. If you fill it really full, it just takes a little longer because there's a lot of stuff in it. But the fries do come out really crunchy.\nWe have cooked chicken multiple times and it comes out tender with a crisp skin.\nAs far as cons, only a couple of minor things. The racks do seem a little loose, but they hold. The door also can pop off if you get aggressive while opening it. When food is finished, there are 5 loud beeps when maybe 3 or 4 would do. Again, I'm nitpicking here because we absolutely love this thing. It is a workhorse for us."},{"reviewerName":"Vienn M.

From some reviews it seems that some people got a lemon. Mine is perfect so far but I did get an extended warranty just in case. I put an oven temperature gauge in it a few times and the readouts are pretty close when it heats up. Mine draws about 13.3 amps but I've not tried to load up the circuit while I\"m using it.

They replaced it with the new \"Elite\". This time I bought the 3 year warranty, highly advised. The Elite is much better built, Mt guess is they will phase out the first gen oven (I'm referring to the oven not original air fryer basket) as they had too many problems with them. Just a guess based on them coming out with an upgraded but so similar product so quickly after launching the oven. Anyway, get the Elite.\n\nLove it. As an owner of the original Power Air Fryer I was skeptical that I'd like this one as much. I need a larger oven and gave it a try. It is truly a huge improvement from the original. I love the easily removable trays (easy to clean) but I really love the rotating basket. I use Orieda Steak fries and they were always dry in the original air fryer. I was going to start using the oven again. With the rotating basket I LOVE my fries. Soft but a tad crispy, just the best. I was concerned that the oven might be a hassle to clean but it's not at all. A paper towel is all it takes to clean the drip tray. One more paper towel to wipe out the inside (doesn't get that dirty) and the trays and basket clean up quick in the sink. I clean the trays after each use (takes a second) and the other stuff after every few times The food does cook on the bottom better than the original but it's still best to turn items halfway through as the heating element is up top. I also cook breaded fish sprayed lightly with canola or sesame oil. Not as good as real fried food but less messy, healthier and a nice variation for a change.
