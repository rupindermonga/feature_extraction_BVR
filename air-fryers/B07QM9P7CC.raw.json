I received it on Saturday and immediately got it all set up and ready to use. I decided to throw a handful of frozen fries in to test it out. They came out great and tasted better than in the oven. Unfortunately, when I pulled the drawer out by the handle to look at the fries, the basket and handle detached from the drawer and the drawer fell on the floor. Thankfully there wasn‚Äôt any grease or other hot liquid in it! We have checked everything over to make sure I hadn‚Äôt put it together wrong, but it just looks like the clips that attach the basket to the drawer are just too small to support the weight. Hopefully they‚Äôll change this for a future design because I‚Äôd hate to see someone get hurt from a flying 400¬∞ metal basket."},{"reviewerName":"B.

I ordered one for my sister as a Mother's Day gift to try it out, and if she liked it I would order one for myself. We both wanted this to work, but after using it for dinner one time this weekend (we made wings and fries) the air fryer wouldn't turn on when we tried to use it a second time. It took a lot of cajoling until it finally worked again (and by that point the chicken was already in the oven).\n\nTwo stars for concept, but disappointed that the product does not seem to be well-made (especially for the price).

Constantly online reading reviews, comparing features, size, cost etc. until my eyes started to blur. It was originally the Skinnytaste Facebook group that got me thinking about getting an AF and all the things I could do with it. This one is the perfect size, it has all the presets to make it easy, but some of the reviews weren't great. Honestly, it sounded like it's a newer product and just a bit \"buggy\" but I noticed all the negative reviews were updated after stating that the manufacturer replaced their AF or whatever was the case. It sounded like they were really on top of it and that's what sold me. I have it a couple weeks and used it 3x so far with ZERO issues (just haven't been home enough to door more).

I started with a 2.75 qt air fryer with a round basket and it just wasn't large enough. The 5.8 qt capacity with a basket that is a 'squared off oval' (hard to explain, trust me it's wonderful) has enough space to cook most anything. Although it is larger, the overall footprint isn't significantly bigger compared to the smaller air fryers. Is also quieter, almost too quiet. I really have to pay attention to hear the beeping when it is completed cooking, but that isn't a deal breaker.\n\nThe preset buttons and pre-heating is a great bonus! Extremely useful if you like to cook all the skinnytaste recipes as it is the same air fryer that she uses, so it takes all the guesswork out of cooking. Highly recommend this air fryer to all.

I love that it doesn't heat up my kitchen or use as much electricity as an oven. It's very easy to clean and the nonstick is effective. I hope Skinnytaste comes out with a set of accessories! The manual warned that it would have a strong plastic smell the first time you use it. I noticed that it took about 4 times for that smell to go away.

I bought the recipe book along with the air fryer and we've used it almost everyday since we received it. The air fryer came earlier than expected and is simple to use. The basket is large enough for me to put food for our family of 5 in it which makes for quicker cooking. All of the recipes we have tried in it have been great; some of our favorites include the eggrolls, chicken tenders, and fries. I love skinnytaste and all of her products and appreciate her quick responses to questions, feedback, or posts about making her recipes. This air fryer seems to be a good quality and we love the presets that match up with the cooking times skinnytaste uses in her recipes! It makes it easy to program for everyone-my fiance, my mom, and myself included. I would HIGHLY recommend ordering this air fryer (and the cookbook) if you're looking for a healthier way to eat some delicious tasting food! When I move out, I will definitely be ordering another for myself!"},{"reviewerName":"GDT","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great product!","reviewDate":"October 11, 2019","reviewText":"I just got my Vremi, and I'm so happy. Not only did it come one day earlier than anticipated, but I also got to use it the same day due to easy to follow instructions. The air fryer comes with a little recipe pamphlet developed by Gina Homolka, whom I'm a big fan of. It was actually through her blog I found this product. The air fryer is easy to use, and I really like the preset settings - such as fries & different types of meat, it is easy to clean (which is a must for me) and the food I've made thus far has come out great. It should also be noted that I ordered another brand first, but it didn't meet my expectations, in terms of preset functions and recipe collection, so I returned it and got the Vremi instead."},{"reviewerName":"Lahrisa Steenbock","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"I waited for this one!!","reviewDate":"September 8, 2019","reviewText":"I am so excited to finally have an air fryer. I wanted this one specifically since it was backed by Skinnytaste. I would say 75% of my cooking are her recipes. The food I have made in it comes out great. I have made chicken, salmon and shrimp in the air fryer with all great results.\n\nMy only issue is the plastic part that covers the basket release button broke off after a few weeks, It doesn't hurt the operating of the air fryer so I guess it is ok. I have noticed just recently some of the black color of the basket is coming off. I have never put it in the dishwasher even though it says it can. I only hand wash it.

I had a previous air fryer which was much smaller and was not electronic; I wasn‚Äôt able to cook nearly as much as I am now in one round. Saves so much time. I tested mine out with a basic recipe first - hard boiled eggs! It passed the test and the yolk was perfectly creamy too. Yum! Just finished making ‚ÄúBreakfast Turkey Sausage‚Äù from Gina‚Äôs new air fryer cookbook in my new air fryer and it came out amazingly delicious! I actually forgot to spray the basket before putting the turkey patties in and thought I was done for as I previously would have to scrape food off of my older air fryer if I forgot my cooking spray. However, the patties slid right off so easily. The non-stick coating works great! Making everything less greasy too, which is a plus for me. I would highly recommend this air fryer.

It is a huge piece of equipment and we have no place to put it so we have to leave it on our counter.

I unplugged and let it sit a few minutes, plugged it back in and it was the same...every blue light was on. I couldn‚Äôt read the numbers (all 8s of course). The heat was still on so I continued cooking for the last few minutes the fries needed. Right before they were supposed to be done, screen went black but heat was still on.

I am still trying to fall in love with my instant pot! I was shocked at how easy it was to cook with the air fryer and even more shocked at how delicious everything has come out. The first thing we made was potato wedges, and they were crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. When we make potato wedges in the oven it takes about 30 - 45 minutes plus lots of oil. We had them ready to devour in 20 minutes using about a teaspoon of oil. Then we made fried chicken and were SOLD. We never make fried chicken because of how much oil is used, the mess and the time. Crispy delicious fried chicken in less than 30 minutes with hardly any mess or oil. Needless to say, this has become a regular cooking appliance and we have even baked cinnamon rolls in it. Bonus it is easy to clean and goes into the dishwasher.

If i preheat it without a mode,just by temperature then pull out the basket to put food on, it shuts off and i have to power it back on. It only restarts without having to completely start over if a mode is picked. Which i found out by talking to customer service!\n\nIt's very easy to clean but i do have to say that after having used it once and i followed the cleaning instructions, which was wipe with a warm cloth and mild dish soap (I used dawn) I noticed that the logo \"skinny taste\" was smeared??? I swiped it with my thumb and it smeared more, so i grabbed a paper towel and with applying barely any pressure it wiped the entire logo off.

I made eggs, salmon, and zucchini boats. It took a little getting used to, but all-in-all, super happy with my purchase. And clean-up was a breeze.\n\nBUT I did notice that the tray that holds the basket didn't really snug up to the unit when it was locked in place. There was virtually no gap and it didn't affect the cooking and it was barely noticeable so I let it be.\n\nMaybe that had nothing to do with the issue I now have, but the tray and basket no longer latch to the air fryer itself. You can slide them in but you don't need to press the button to slide them right back out. Nothing appears to be broken, the unit has been on my kitchen counter since it was purchased - it just stopped locking.\n\nI waited to purchase an air fryer because it's skinny taste and I wanted to support the brand, but now I'm kind of bummed. Amazon is refunding me, so that's good but now I'm back in the market for an air fryer."},{"reviewerName":"Francis Chau","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great fryer!

I haven't used it yet...BUT I wanted to review the features I have noticed so far. I have owned 3 air fryers. 2 Power XLs and a Kalorik. All 3 have had problems with the teflon peeling off and food sticking after just 3 or 4 months after using it. I called Verimi customer service before purchasing and explained what seems to be a problem of the teflon coming off with air fryers. The person that answered was in the US and spoke perfect English. She said that it has been a problem with 1 in 20 of their air fryers and they replace the basket s free of charge for 2 years!. She said they have been using the air fryer daily in their office for over a year and have not had any problems with it. I really appreciated their honesty. Their warranty is a 2 year warranty. NONE of the other air fryers I have purchased have more than a 90 day warranty! I noticed some differences with the Vremi air fryer out of the box and I wanted to write this review while they are fresh on my mind. The packaging was very professional. The air fryer has a grounded 3 pronged heavy duty cord. None of the others have that. I like that for safety reasons. The panel is very user friendly. I has a preheat setting of 3 minutes. When I washed the basket and outer pot noticed the towel sliding over the teflon like a newly waxed car. I tried on the XL and not so. The heating element is covered with stainless steel mesh. NONE of the others have that. So far I recommend the Vremi air fryer mainly because of the warranty and customer service. I will let you know if the teflon peeling is a problem."},{"reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Air fryer","reviewDate":"May 17, 2019","reviewText":"This is my first air fryer.

I‚Äôve heard stories from friends that you can do anything in the air fryer, from french fries, to steak, to wings, to even pizza. I decided to make wings and french fries. The one complaint I‚Äôve heard from air fryers was you have to stop cooking halfway through and rotate whatever you‚Äôre cooking inside so it cooks evenly. My wings I flipped around 12 minutes and cook for an additional 12 minutes. These wings and fries are probably the best that I‚Äôve made it home, from normally using an oven, I plan on making everything out of an air fryer from here on out. I was able to fit maybe 7 full wings in on a row. The amount of grease and sludge that came off the wings and drained into the pan was disgusting. And to think we‚Äôd eat that normally.

I had an issue with the fryer cutting out once around the fifth use, but unplugged it and replugged it in and haven't had an issue since (about ten or 15 more uses since then). Even though I've cleaned everything multiple times - and this nonstick surface is THE BEST - there's still a lingering plastic smell/taste to foods cooked. But the customer service provided by Vremi is horrible. I used their chat feature to ask what accessories might work with the unit and they were unable to answer, saying they'd refer the question to their product specialist. That was on May 21, and twice they have closed the inquiry believing it resolved although they have provided no answer. I can't imagine how difficult it would be to return the unit. I love Gina's recipes and the Skinnytaste brand and am disappointed that the company she chose to partner with is so unreliable."},{"reviewerName":"Eric Jacobson","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Packed with features, easy-to-use and cooks with fantastic flavor!","reviewDate":"June 19, 2019","reviewText":"I first got into air frying thanks to the Skinnytaste's One and Done cookbook which includes a number of air frying recipes, but I started by buying an inexpensive small model from JC Penney to experiment (just in case I didn't enjoy the flavor or trouble of this new approach to cooking).\n\nI got hooked! The flavor of foods cooked with air frying is remarkably close to traditional oil frying without the extra calories. Unfortunately, the model I bought was far too small and simplistic with only timer and temperature knobs.\n\nAs a Skinnytaste fan for a very long time, I was ecstatic to see Vremi release an actual Skinnytaste Air Fryer so I could fully take advantage of the Skinnytaste recipes I had as well as the ones that were included in their most recent release - the Skinnytaste Air Fryer Cookbook.\n\nThe Vremi Skinnytaste Air Fryer is really outstanding and completely worth its reasonable price. The fryer is incredibly easy-to-use with an intuitive interface and combines a huge capacity with a huge amount of versatility from its features.\n\nAlthough not necessary, the digital touch-screen and presets makes it so simple to cook almost anything. What a fantastic piece of cooking technology! If you have any interest in air frying, I highly recommend you skip the smaller-sized entry-level models and pick up one like this Vremi.\n\nIf you're like me and love fried foods but hate the unhealthy results, I think you'll absolutely love air frying."},{"reviewerName":"Mary","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Love my air fryer.","reviewDate":"August 17, 2019","reviewText":"This thing runs so quiet.

My family didn't care for the first batch, but the second time I tossed them in a bit of olive oil and seasoning and they were delicious. Did bacon this morning and it came out great. I don't like how hot the outside gets where you need to remove the basket, but using a pot holder solves that problem. So far so good. It would be great for a single person, couple, or small family, but to cook for a lot of people would be time consuming this way.

The first thing we tried were frozen steak fries. They turned out really good. We‚Äôve also made two versions of chicken wings, chicken parm and hard boiled eggs. This thing works great and the food has come out perfect. It‚Äôs also very easy to clean. The two pieces fit in the dishwasher with no problems but I‚Äôve mostly washed by hand because I don‚Äôt want to start the dishwasher when it‚Äôs not full.
