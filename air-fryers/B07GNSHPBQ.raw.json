We tossed it in corn starch and sprayed a little oil on it after shaking and it was so perfectly crunchy on the outside and soft in the middle. For this alone it is completely worth it.\nSecondly, being a GF family we miss out on those yummy fried foods you usually get in restaurants and we’re very very pleased with the fried mushrooms, zucchini and onion rings. It even made frozen French fries just like a deep fryer.\nIt’s big but the size is perfect if you have a family.

I was happy with the size of the basket to hold enough food to feed my family of 4. I started with an easy recipe of just quartered red potatoes. They cooked quickly and were crispy. My 5 year old who often complains about the food I make said I should open a restaurant. That's high praise from her. I've cooked chicken and fish from frozen in the air fryer as well as reheated pizza for a crispy crust. The fryer is super easy to clean, which is important to me. I highly recommend it as long as you have the storage space for it as it is a fairly large appliance."},{"reviewerName":"Dawn","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great recipes included","reviewDate":"March 6, 2019","reviewText":"I have owned the Dash compact air fryer for a while.

He is a man who loves all things fried...wings, french fries, burgers, corn dogs, etc. I decided to bite the bullet and I'm so glad I did! Be warned...this thing is HUUUGE! Other reviewers said it was big, but I didn't realize how big it was. Like, it's bigger than my 6qt InstantPot. Not a problem for me as I have the storage space, but something to consider for those with limited storage and counter top space. That being said, there are no other negatives. It's so easy to use, cleans super easy, and food comes out sooo good. So far I've made country potatoes and chicken cordon bleu, and my husband raved about how good they were, despite being way lower in fat than how I've previously made these dishes.

It is one of the largest I own, other than my small microwave that sits on my counter. The appliance will not fit into my cupboards so will have to remain on the counter when not in use. I used the fryer to cook chicken tenders and tater tots, and it worked well, however the \"cookbook\" that came with the appliance was more of an instruction manual and not an actual cookbook, even to cook the basic things, so I pretty much guessed the temperature and time, relying mainly on the food package directions for oven preparation. One suggestion I would give to the manufacturer/supplier is to include several of the parchment paper liners. I wondered about the mess and clean-up involved, so I Googled whether I could use parchment paper as a liner in the basket -- turns out that the liners are a big deal! Rather than waiting to purchase liners, I simply traced a 9\" plate onto the parchment paper, cut it out, folded it in quarters, and used a hand-held paper punch to punch holes, then folded again and did the innermost section of the liner. It worked fantastic, and I will probably use homemade ones rather than store-bought ones which cost approximately ten cents each. Overall seems to be a great product, but is bigger than expected."},{"reviewerName":"Josiane","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"It leaks and that sucks!","reviewDate":"The manufacturer commented on the review below","reviewText":"Ok for the price but...This fryer is really huge.

It worked great, just as I expected. After a couple of weeks of light use, making various recipes to figure out what its best use for me is, the basket's coating started chipping off. Clearly defective. So, I contacted the manufacturer to see if they could send me a new basket. In my email I praised the machine. They sent back a note saying they don't sell parts, but would send me a new unit, as a ONE TIME COURTESY, if I send my defective unit back. No apology, no further info. Just telling me that I wasn't able to BUY a replacement for the defective part. I was very puzzled by such strange customer service. So, I wrote back and pointed out I was not planning on buying a part from them to replace something defective they sold me. I let them know that was not a way to give me confidence in their company enough to purchase more items from them. They wrote back with no comment other than asking me for my address and the model number. I'm curious if I will in fact receive a new unit from them. Even if I do, their customer service leaves quite a bit to be desired.

It’s easy to clean and easy to use.\n\nHowever, I do still have to cook outside because it definitely makes my whole apartment smell like whatever I’m cooking. I’m also a little peeved that the instruction manual says specifically that they don’t recommend air frying sausages because of the excess oil, and I feel like an air fryer should be able to handle it :/"},{"reviewerName":"Peter","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great Air Frier, but can sometimes leak from the basket.","reviewDate":"May 27, 2019","reviewText":"Great product and fairly easy to use. It's convenient for meal prepping and makes cleanup faster than pan searing or oven cooking. Not to mention there's fast customer service to boot when it comes to getting a replacement. I had to get a replacement for my original machine due to some issues, however, these problems seem consistent and are cause by slight design flaws when it comes to the pullout basket.\n\nFor starters, if you intend on frequently using this to cook and meal prep, the basket's black colored plating has a good chance of chipping off. This isn't too bad, since the structural integrity of the frying basket is still intact and usable.\nHowever, there is a more annoying design flaw overall with the pullout basket. There is a screw at the bottom of the container used to screw in a spacer piece separating the porous basket from the surrounding container. After a couple of usages, this spacer will has a chance of reshaping, allowing for oil or whatnot to slowly seep through the outer basket into the Frier itself. Cleanup becomes a bit more tedious because of this.\n\nOverall, a good machine, with some minor problems, but still worth the price compared to other air fries of this size."},{"reviewerName":"KDC","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"A great product made even better","reviewDate":"March 10, 2019","reviewText":"I have been enjoying the Dash Compact Air Fryer for several months. The only drawback to this product was the size. Enter the Dash Deluxe Electric Air Fryer. The large capacity basket makes it possible to cook larger amounts. My first meal was fish and chips. I cooked the entire batch of potatoes first. While the crispy potatoes were keeping warm in the oven, I was able to air fry a large amount of fish.

Last year we purchased a rotisserie as a healthier method to cook that would still be tasty. And it was great...but the clean-up is horrendous and the uses were pretty limited. This air fryer provided the same healthy cooking option but its uses are so far limitless. We've done fresh chicken breasts to frozen cordon bleu, frozen shrimp to fresh cod, and the gambit of fresh veggies to my husband's favorite - tator tots. The result has been incredible. Both fresh chicken and fish is golden crispy on the outside while maintaining juicy goodness inside. Even the delicate cod was suitable for the fryer. The cook time is only slightly less than the oven but the ability to move the fryer outside allows me to cook without heating up the kitchen. A bonus during the summer. We have used it almost every day for the last two months and have yet to find anything it cannot do. Super satisfied and highly recommend this product. Clean-up is a breeze. I lightly spray the inner basket with Pam spray and all it needs is a wipe of a sponge and hot soapy water. I clean after every use to avoid flavor transfer."},{"reviewerName":"K.

Honestly I think Chicken strips and french fries are the most common. Not that I don't think that it could handle more just that I don't cook a wide variety of things. I think it is worth it just for what I use it for especially the French fries as I cut up 8 yellow potatoes, a little olive oil, paprika or whatever spices you want, and just let it go. Shake the basket a couple of times then all good. I usually take half out then let the other half cook for an extra 5 as some in my house like softer and some like crispier.

I also have the skinny taste air fryer cookbook because I want to make some tasty stuff that’s also low calorie. I like the funky color because none of our appliances match anyway. I’ve accepted then and now just buy things in strange colors on purpose 🤷🏻‍♀️\n\nI have an actifry from when those things first came out and the turning arm broke anything that went into it. So it has been retired and replaced with this new hotness.\n\nSo for the space egg’s maiden voyage (as coined by another reviewer) I made a low calorie apple crumble from the book mentioned earlier. Prep was super easy and into the egg my 4 apple halves went. The recipe said 27 minutes, I think I could have cut the time shorter but they cane out ooey gooey and delicious.\n\nThen there was clean up to do. I was worried because some of the sugar flour mixture got on the tray and the basket but after some dawn and just a sponge everything came off in record time.\n\nI really look forward to making more recipes with this and am very pleased with its initial performance.\n\nI would recommend this to family and friends."},{"reviewerName":"Carrie Gratton","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Worth it","reviewDate":"February 19, 2019","reviewText":"I've been thinking about getting an air fryer for a while and finally gave in.

I works wonderful and cooks it the time my electric over takes to preheat. So far everything has come out wonderfully done a whole chicken in about an hour, fries took only minutes to cook. I love the red color and its size is great for us I haven't had to do more that the basket holds yet. I feel the key to this fryer is because of its size I can not put it in a cabinet so it sits on my counter top which is a good thing because it reminds me to use it. So appliances that you buy you put away and forget you have it so it never gets use, like our deep fryer witch I have gotten rid of now that I have the air fryer, its better for us and we are now eating less grease food.

I will admit that when I first got it, I was not sold on it. The first thing I made was broccoli and it was all dried out (due to me not knowing what I was doing). Rather than get discouraged, I went onto Pinterest and researched how to cook with an air fryer and tried some recipes. That made all the difference, and I am now sold on it. I do a lot of weekend batch cooking, and adding this device to my Instapot has taken the meals I prep to the next level. The only drawback is how big it is - but I understand it needs to be to get the capacity I was looking for. I donated a bunch of unused pots and pans, and was able to make room in my cupboard. I use it almost every day, and so far have had no issues with it."},{"reviewerName":"Special K","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"It has it's own permanent spot on the counter because we use it all the time!","reviewDate":"October 14, 2019","reviewText":"Very happy with this air fryer!

I also really appreciate being able to toss a snack like frozen egg rolls into the air fryer and have them come out super crispy without have to heat the oven up for just a couple small things. Hot dogs and bratwurst taste amazing when heated in the air fryer- just like they had been grilled! This air fryer is huge and big enough for my family of 6, I am so glad I purchased it and I wish I had gotten it sooner.

Great wings. PROBLEM gasket, should I return?","reviewDate":"September 4, 2019","reviewText":"This appliance is large. I watched the video with the specific view to comparing the size of the fryer to a human (a small female), so I wasn't shocked. But to have an air fryer worth bothering with seems like this size is the ticket. I like to cook for two adults with average appetites and a love for veg. This will make veg for two, maybe wings for 3? Looks great with my antique (still in use) minty green 1950's appliances.\n\nPROBLEM: There is a plastic nut with a screw on the bottom of the outer basket. This nut has a silicone cover that serves as a gasket which also keeps the non-stick basket from scraping on the bottom or sides of outer solid \"basket\" and should keep things leaking out of the bottom. No matter how many times I replace this cover/gasket over the nut and tighten the screw again it ALWAYS COMES OFF DURING COOKING. Which means it leaks oil etc. inside the appliance and on any surface you place the removable unit outside the fryer. Additionally if you aren't aware this gasket could be (and almost was) washed away in the sink more than once and it is a pain to replace EVERY TIME, plus the oil spills. Is my unit defective?\n\nOtherwise a useful and quick kitchen appliance that has pulled it's weight in the past month. I'm not even a \"wing person\" (is that a thing?) but this makes some killer wings with a dry spice rub and then dredged in corn starch. Simple and delicious.\n\nWings the true star so far, we like to entertain and they have been a universal hit. We do not eat or reheat much processed food so this is all straight home cooking. I live in potato country (farms all around,) and I will say that if you cut fresh potatoes and then \"fry\" in here with a small amount of oil you will have something directly in between french fries and the best oven roasted crispy potatoes you have ever eaten. Not actual french fries, but leaning that way. Very tasty though, much less oil to purchase, and MUCH LESS \"fried\" odor in your house.\n\nBuy it if you have enough storage and want wings or \"fried\" potatoes. But the gasket is a hassle and a problem not everyone will enjoy."},{"reviewerName":"Janel De Jesús","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"It stopped working in less than 2 months","reviewDate":"June 22, 2019","reviewText":"I initially was very happy with the airfryer however it didn't last very long\nNot even 2 months went by and it just stopped working.

I use this more than my microwave now. I actually may even use it *as* my microwave because I reheat almost everything in it—fries, pizza, chicken, sandwiches...the list goes on.\nI know the purpose is to cook food from the beginning, but it's so helpful for reheating too, so I wanted to mention that.\nThe basket is very large; I can fit a whole chicken in it, but that would be ridiculous b/c it'd never cook the whole way without resetting the 30 minute timer over and over.\nIt's super easy to clean, too. I just take it out and place it in the dishwasher. Much easier than trying to clean all of the little holes and slots by hand.\nNothing seems to stick beyond easy removal. I've cooked everything from frozen salmon (nope, the skin doesn't stick either) to fried chicken.\nThe blower is pretty strong, so I wouldn't put anything with loose toppings on it (pizza), but for reheating, pizza does fine.\nThe unit itself is rather large. The only place I can store it is on top of my fridge.\nIt does put off some heat. I walked out of my kitchen and back in after using it to cook various different items and could definitely feel the difference, but it does not get hot enough to damage its surroundings.\nI place it on my cooktop (see picture for reference) for cooking.\nI highly recommend this guy."},{"reviewerName":"Anne Hart","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Easy to use","reviewDate":"March 20, 2019","reviewText":"Came very well packaged and is very easy to use and clean.

I wanted something to cook hot wings and after thinking about a deep fryer, I decided to give this unit a try. I started out with a 10# bag of wings from Sam's. I used Franks Red Hot and butter for the sauce. After overdosing on hot sauce I decided to try Tyson Buffalo Wings from Sam's or BJ's. I like my wings crispy. I spray the pan with olive oil spray to prevent sticking. 10-12 wings fit with a single layer. I cook the wings at full power for 14 minutes (from frozen), flip and cook another 12 minutes. They are extra crispy!!! A lot of times I don't use hot sauce at all. Cleaning is simple. I soak the whole pan and basket in hot water with dish liquid. Then I run a dish brush around inside.

This Dash is well made, doesn’t impart any smells to the food, it cooks evenly and it’s quiet. Some air dryers are loud due to fans but this one is pretty quiet. I would like a 60 minute timer, but I just roll it back if necessary. Don’t force the timer, turn off heat and let it finish ticking away.

Cleaning it is probably the worst part. The instructions say clean after every use but if you're just putting mostly dry items in, it could be used a few times. The bottom section of the drawer has a button to prop up the basket, which leaks a bit when you're soaking with water/soap or if you get a layer of grease on the bottom, it could leak into the bottom of the oven. Only 1 screw holds that in but doesn't seem to be much of a problem, just have to be aware of it.

If you are single or small family or just want to do small batches of fried foods/appetizers then I highly suggest the smaller size Dash"},{"reviewerName":"james","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Best AIR FRYER EVER","reviewDate":"March 19, 2019","reviewText":"Does everything expected and more.

Replacement had frayed wires!","reviewDate":"October 25, 2019","reviewText":"I loved this while it worked. Used it 3 times and then the 4th time a VERY LOUD noise started to emit - like a fan banging up against housing. Luckily, was within return window so ordered a replacement. Unpacked the replacement and the front housing fell off - exposing a FRAYED wire! Didn't even plug that unit in. I really liked the looks of this brand and loved the way it air fried the first couple times I used it. VERY disappointed that I know feel I need to search for a different brand as I don't trust this brand to work. I will say the 2nd replacement shipment was NOT packed well - no padding or styrofoam at all. This may have caused the housing to come apart. I am also bummed that now two huge plastic machines are headed to the plastics graveyard. From an environmental standpoint, that makes me angry as well."},{"reviewerName":"Thumbs-Up!!","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"LOVE!!","reviewDate":"September 2, 2019","reviewText":"I can't thank my sister enough for showing me what a Air fryer was!!

I really like that the control is a dial vs. a digital readout as I think it will hold up longer with heat exposure. Everything I've made so far has had great results.

The second time it happened, my three year old was in the kitchen and it could have easily burned her because it fell apart. The third time it happened it fell apart and literally flew about 5 feet across the kitchen floor! Praise God my 1 year old baby wasn't by my feet like normal.

I contacted Dash to ask if they would provide help to fix the damage. They only offered a replacement and one other Dash appliance. My priority was to fix the damage, not the offer of a replacement. I returned the appliance to Amazon and now in the process of getting the quartz countertop repaired; with no assistance from Dash. Dash gave me the impression they did not believe me, stating this had never happened. Why in the world would I choose to go after Dash to get my quartz repaired????? if it wasn't their appliance that caused it. Very disappointed in Dash and will never buy another Dash product.

There is a small pedestal with a rubber cover to help support the crisper tray which is fastened with a small screw from the bottom, and it leaks on the counter almost every time when I pull it out to cool.

You'll save so much money on oil! Your food will taste the same just as long as you season it the same way. Though you cant really fry an egg or anything with a liquid consistency like batter for instance i'ts easy to use and easy to clean. My only advice when using the fryer is to make sure all other appliances are not in close range of the gadget. it blows hot air from behind and it melted a small corner of plastic on my coffee machine. Other than that 5 Stars !"},{"reviewerName":"Ashley Renee Brown","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Buy those air fryer","reviewDate":"August 8, 2019","reviewText":"This is a great air fryer!

Cleaning is easy as the basket separates from the base bull out tray.\n\nI did chicken wings, seasoned with just some BBQ dry rub spices and threw them cooked for 20 mins, rotated them and cooked for another 10 mins and they were awesome.\n\nOnly concern I have is where do I store this beast?!"},{"reviewerName":"SHELLIE","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Do not buy!

Still, I was excited to have it. Dash is a brand I know because I have two of their Greek yogurt makers that are terrific.\n\nI made chicken fingers first. They were overcooked and tasteless. Next, I made baked potatoes that were so terrible that I wondered why anyone would make baked potatoes in this instead of an oven or microwave. Next, I roasted an almost seven pound turkey breast. Dry and shrunken. All made using recipes I found online or in an air fryer cookbook. I thought it must be me who was doing something wrong. Air fried tofu was the next thing I made and was exceptionally careful. It came out okay--probably because cooking time is short and my vegetarian son said it was good. Pretty tasteless, I thought, but that's tofu for you. Then, I decided to make the Monkey Bread recipe in the booklet that came with the Dash Air Fryer.\nIt tells you to use two cans of refrigerator biscuits. No brand name or type given. I bought two cans--each with eight biscuits inside. One can turned out to just fit in the fryer. I very carefully followed the recipe exactly. What I ended up with were burnt sugar hockey pucks. See picture. Hard and inedible.\n\nVery disappointing to get a defective air fryer. It is going back to Amazon tomorrow. I may eventually buy another one, but for now I will make do with my oven and microwave. I may be a slow learner, but at least I know it isn't me."},{"reviewerName":"RE","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Healthier food for everyone!","reviewDate":"February 2, 2019","reviewText":"This is a huge airfryer. It can probably fit 4 chicken thighs, so it is perfect for a family of 3 -4. I was so excited to try it out and cooked some crispy fried pork belly. It turned out great! Could not even tell that it was cooked in an airfryer with very little oil spray. Can't wait to try this for other food that we usually fry like fish and sausages. A great appliance to have for a healthier lifestyle."},{"reviewerName":"angela devillier","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Everyone should have one of these!!!!!","reviewDate":"March 28, 2019","reviewText":" WOW!!!!!

Its not a programmable, it's a timer turner'ish type of deal. With that said, I've not had any issues with the outcome. If you have a tendency to want exactness- this isn't a good fit. Go with the flow, your good.\n\nNote: I have not found a graceful way to do pizzas or omelettes due to inexperience or inability to use a spatula. It's always a slide out or a lucky flip... I'm working on it.\n\nWhat this does for salmon is worth every penny!! Have had fun with tenders and am searching for very healthy recipies which are available online easy.\n\nThis is a really big appliance but I'm glad I went with this size vs the smaller- I can see how the smaller would not really work for 3 people.\n\nMake sure you have a place for the 'big egg' that does wonders for food.

The only downside to me is the dials, it's almost like give or take a minute or 2 on the timer dial as getting it exact would be too much a task.

So when I saw that Dash made this stylish air fryer, that was a pretty decent size, I had to buy it. However, I just couldn’t get past the smell. Fair warning, I have a keen sense of smell. And so when I first opened the air fryer all I smelled was plastic. But after washing it a few times, the smell was fair and it was okay. I decided to try making tortilla chips. They came out awful. They were soggy, not fried at all, but worst of all... I could taste the plastic smell. Next I tried French fries. Same thing... the fryer would not fry and that ‘plastic taste’ made my food inedible. My husband also tasted the plastic. So we thought maybe something was melting inside. After a quick inspection, and finding nothing was melting, we just figured that’s what the food would taste like.\n\nWe followed all the directions, hand washed everything that was washable and still that plastic smell would not go away. And I tried frying a few more things but again they wouldn’t fully fry. At one point everything was spinning around in the basket and it made a mess.\n\nThis totally bummed me out that it didn’t work properly. Needless to say we returned the product. But now I’m a bit scared to purchase another air fryer. I think I’ll stick to lightly frying my food."},{"reviewerName":"Lauren","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Air Frying - Where Has This Been My Whole Life??","reviewDate":"October 3, 2019","reviewText":"I have discovered a whole new world of cooking! Not only are there all kinds of cool meals you can make in this thing, you can also make all the hum-drum frozen things in this air fryer FASTER than you did in the oven. So far, I have really just made wings and cooked frozen things from the freezer, but I am blown away. The wings were amazing and the frozen things were all way better than they are when they come out of the oven. They are crispier and get done a lot quicker.\nAs for the device itself, this thing is a beast! Granted I did not read the dimensions of the appliance, but I was quite shocked at how big it is. That being said, it does not look unattractive on the counter. I purchased the black one and it is a very large egg shape. The basket is easy to release and everything cleans up easily. The things I have made so far, though, really haven't made much of a mess.\nOne note - pay attention to the sticker on the front that says not to press the release button without having a support under the basket. My dumb butt, in my excitement to unpack the device, was like I wonder what this does?. Slide off the cover, push the button and out dropped the basket. Fortunately I caught it on the first bounce after glancing off the counter and there was just a slight ding in the bottom. I looked over after that and saw the sticker warning me to not do the dumb thing I just did. lol. Anyway, be careful releasing the basket because the metal is not super thick and I imagine a good drop to the ground would ding it up pretty good.\nSo bottom line - this air fryer is awesome. It's my first one, so I don't have much to compare it to, but I can definitely say that I like it. Of all the appliances I have bought for the kitchen, this one goes right up there with the egg cooker. They both seem gimmicky, but both are awesome and well worth owning!"},{"reviewerName":"Ame Dee","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Worked exceptionally for two months, then fan simply QUIT.","reviewDate":"July 11, 2019","reviewText":"This fryer was bought to replace one that had the drawer accidentally melted on the stove top when someone turned on the wrong burner.

Well, it's really true. We saw a TV news segment about how popular these fryers have become, so we wanted to give it a try for ourselves. Our first project was to make sweet potato fries with a great big sweet potato. We didn't want to wait 30 minutes to soak the cut potatoes, so we put them in a bowl and used olive oil spray to lightly coat them. We tossed them in the basket and turned it on. Only 14 minutes later (after shaking the basket (horizontally) after the first 7 minutes, we had perfect crispy fries. Wow! That was impressive. The machine stops when you open the basket to check the status of the food, so there's no worry of becoming crispy yourself by opening the basket. It's hard to believe that it works so well and so easily, so I know it will get a lot of use. What fun to rediscover enjoying foods we avoided because of all the fat. I highly recommend this unit. It does have a big footprint, so be sure to check out the measurements so you know you'll have a place to store it when not in use.

It was a huge impulse by thanks to a lightning deal and I have zero regrets. I didn’t even look at its size when I ordered but with a family of 4, I’m so grateful it’s so damn big!\n\nI love Dash products and have little baby waffle iron that I use for a small batch of eggs (trust me on this) and making a waffle using a canned cinnamon roll. I’ve only had the air fryer a little over a week and have already used it for many meals, snacks and reheating.\n\nI’ve made: Pork loin chops, chicken, bacon wrapped asparagus, honey BBQ wings, broccoli, steak fries, mozzarella sticks, canned cinnamon rolls, corndogs, tater tots and much more to come.\n\nWith the help of a website, I have easily figured out the conversion times of anything in the oven to the air fryer and I LOVE it. It’s easy for my kids to use as well. There are accessory bundles available so it’s easier to make things without fear of it dripping to the under pan, which does wipe out super easy but I’ve placed paper towels at the bottom. I’ve heard that you can do cakes in the air fryer so I’m going to try it. Remember that anything you can put in the oven, can go in the air fryer, it is just a matter of time conversion to cooking it thoroughly. Also, use a bit of oil, it’s ok. AND do not believe every Facebook or Pinterest post. It may take time to figure everything out and get it right. My cinnamon rolls from the can work great the first time but you HAVE to flip them halfway through or just one side gets cooked. I didn’t mind doing this. I also recommend the parchment papers, 100 for $9, makes cleanup easy and no weird cutting to get it the right size.\n\nI recommend this air fryer and I’d have gladly paid full price instead of the lightning deal price.

I was skeptical at first but one batch of chicken wings made me a believer. haha. This is a large capacity air fryer but the food is better cooked in one layer so keep that in mind. Also be aware this fryer will take up a LOT of room on your kitchen counter or wherever you store it so bear that in mind if your kitchen is small like mine. For best results: preheat the fryer about 5 minutes for bone-in meat, which I seem to have the best results with. Still experimenting with it at this point but have done boneless chicken tenders, wings, drummettes and bone-in pork chops. Also tried fried (battered frozen) okra --it turned out dry. Fresh veggies turn out best in it as anything frozen has to thaw first then cook. I have used only minimal olive oil or olive oil non stick spray and love that the food isn't greasy but taste just like it was fried the \"regular\" way. The color is beautiful as well. I am using this fryer for a family of 4 and wanted a large capacity. Even though it takes up a lot of room I'm glad I got the larger one as it cooks more food at a time than a smaller one and the less time I am cooking the better.

Suggest to get an oil mister to spray the insert and food prior to cooking, makes it really easy to get crisp coating. Can fit a few wings and thighs in maybe 5 pieces total for each cook cycle. Using the accessories available on Amazon, such as a rack increases the amount you can cook for one cycle. Cleanup is a breeze and takes minimal time to figure out temp dial and times for cooking.

My food is crisp and cooked wonderfully. Nothing I cook has taken more than 14 minutes. I talk to everyone I know about my new air fryer and am so glad I got it. Now it is a large appliance on your counter top, but I just take it out for a few days at a time then put it back in the box and away it goes. The best part is that it's EASY to clean!!!"},{"reviewerName":"Brigette","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Used Every Day!","reviewDate":"September 3, 2019","reviewText":"Have used this at least once (sometimes more) every day since it was received a week ago. It has earned a permanent place on my counter. I have also used some ceramic dishes in it (using a folded piece of aluminum foil as a sling for easy removal and to protect the non-stick baked coating from the unfinished ceramic base) and it's great for reheating.\n\nSo far I've made breaded calimari, broccoli and squash, London broil, panco-breaded drumsticks, sausages and hash browns, tater tots, pizza rolls and fish sticks. It has pretty much replace the toaster oven completely and I've hardly used the microwave.\n\nHighly recommended if you have the room for it because it is big."},{"reviewerName":"Agirl","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Meh, think twice if you have a convection oven","reviewDate":"September 4, 2019","reviewText":"This \"air fryer\" is the first experience I've had with them. It's pretty easy to use and the food comes out as if you had cooked it in a convection oven, not fried. Nothing is going to replace oil fried food. If you dipped the food in oil before you cooked it, it might come closer. But isn't that defeating the purpose? Now for the bad...the thing is huge, it's loud and it blows super hot air into your kitchen out of the back of the unit. Any one of those things alone had I known before purchasing would have deterred me. If you have a ton of room in your kitchen and don't have a convection oven setting you may want to give this a try, otherwise I'd pass."},{"reviewerName":"D.

Our first time using it we made chicken wings. Put some Old Bay Seasoning, garlic powder and pepper. We had 30 pieces, half drum and half flat, so we did it in two batches and took a little under and hour. There were so delicious, crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. We were both very surprised that they were as delicious and looked as good as the wings on the youtube videos we watched. The two baskets are dishwasher safe but I chose to hand wash them which was very easy with some Dawn, warm water and a sponge. Nothing stuck to it! Very happy!"},{"reviewerName":"BootlegBrewer","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Oh the possibilities","reviewDate":"September 16, 2019","reviewText":"I was skeptical over this thing, but a family member brought one over and we were impressed enough to try it out. We've done all sorts of chicken (wings, nuggets, tenders), shrimp, lumpia, egg rolls, french fries, mozzarella sticks, pork chops, and my wife even tried a grilled cheese at the request of my kid. It's all turned out great. Quick frozen items we would normally throw in the microwave we now throw in this and it's way better. Takes very little oil if any at all to get a crispiness on your food. Cleaning is very, very easy - sometimes what looks stuck on sprays right off."},{"reviewerName":"Angel","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"See photos.

Would have given 5 star, but after only a couple months of use the basket and bottom started to peel off. I did not use anything abrasive to clean this with. I still continued to use it with liners because still love the taste of the food made in it. Therefore why keeping it at 4 star for the most part. Second one I ordered they put instructions sticker right on front. Tried to peel off and now can't get the sticky yuck looking stuff off. Wanted clean and pretty looking like in the photos online.

There were a couple we decided on but when we read the reviews, did not purchase. Finally, we cautiously purchased this one since reviews seemed pretty good. We use it EVERY DAY! We have cooked everything from steak to veggies in it without having to add all the extra oils and butter with pan-fry or grilling. I am also glad we purchased the larger volume so we can cook enough for a family. It is easy to use and makes cooking really fast.

I can't speak to the durability over time but so far it seems really well made and crazy easy to clean. I've made the basics (tater tots and waffle fries), nachos, hashbrowns, bacon wrapped lil smokies, asparagus and little potatoes. I think the air fried veggies are my favorite so far - its so nice to roast vegetables quickly & without waiting for the oven to heat up and not having to clean a huge sheet pan afterwards.

I don’t cook with salt so I use a lot of powdered seasonings (garlic, cumin, allspice, garam masala, etc...) and olive oil and put it into the fryer for 18 minutes at 350. I love that there are only 2 dials. Temperature and time. Clean up is easy. It’s a non-stick coating. Cooked salmon fillets which came out great. I think 8 minutes at 400.

We bought this unit and after less than six uses, yes I said six uses, the Teflon coating inside started bubbling and peeling. Less than a month, less than six uses its already falling apart. We would rinse it out with warm water and soap and wouldn't even scrub with an abrasive sponge! I reached out to customer service who said we don't sell parts but as a one time courtesy, ONE TIME, we will replace the unit. Oh but send yours back first then we will send you another one. Um what? Less than a month and you are doing me a favor? And I am supposed to take your word I will get a replacement if I send you mine? I was furious! What if some of the coating got on the food and one of our kids ate it? I was beyond mad. I asked again when would I get my replacement and was told once we receive yours we will send a replacement. $100 down the drain, what a waste. Never dealt with such sloppy customer service! I emailed them back but doubt I will get a response. And what box do I use? The original box is gone and this thing is a monster what will I send it back to you in? Please please don't buy this, very disappointing! There are similar reviews as well on here."},{"reviewerName":"Kathryn","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Food is crunchy and looks yummy, but tastes like paint","reviewDate":"June 17, 2019","reviewText":"Got this for my husband for Father’s Day. He’d been wanting an air fryer for a while.\nPROS: very easy to use and clean. Uses less energy than an oven but you can cook in this just about anything you can cook in an oven. We made chicken nuggets with our own breading. They cooked quickly, weren’t greasy and they had a nice crunchy exterior and a good golden color.\n\nCONS: The machine is enormous. Takes up way too much counter space. But I could get past that if it made delicious food. We washed the entire basket before the first use, but our meal came out with a horrible taste I can only compare to paint fumes. It was inedible. It’s a shame because I like everything else about the product (except the size) and the food LOOKED tasty and was crunchy, but the flavor was so off-putting we couldn’t eat what we were so excited to cook. It also made our whole house smell like burning plastic.\n\nOverall, I’m kind of lazy and don’t want to return it until I’m SURE this wasn’t just a one-time thing due to it “cooking off the new” and I will try one more, much smaller meal to see if there’s a difference. I’ll update this review if I have better results.\n\nUPDATE 9/26/2019 We have now cooked with this multiple times and the flavor and odor coming from the machine has improved but only marginally. We don’t enjoy the taste of anything that comes out of it. So I cannot recommend anyone purchase this, and ours will be going in the back of some deep cabinet where it’ll sit for ten years until we finally have a yard sale."},{"reviewerName":"P.J.B.","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"The easiest way to put food on the table, bar none. I'm in love with my air fryer!","reviewDate":"September 4, 2019","reviewText":"This is a big, strong, and heavy appliance. It's a well-made air fryer.\nTemperature goes up to 400, hot enough to broil perfectly.\nJust set the time, temp., load it up, shake or turn if needed and get ready to feast.\n\nMy food gets cooked quickly, stays juicy and tender yet still gets a grilled-like crust on the outside.\n\nFind a spot for this to reside in your kitchen, I use mine daily to feed my family, and they come running to the table asking what I've made.\n\nAfter air frying, I don't like using my oven anymore, food just tastes better from my Dash.\n\nI've so far tried pork chops, hard-cooked eggs (!) grilled cheese sandwiches, homemade French Fries, and each has been delicious, tasty and did I mention fast?\n\nI'm keen to try making baked goods like muffins, cakes, and mini-pies.\n\nMy only minor disappointment is often needing to do a second batch.\n\nBut time goes by quickly when it's simply under 20 minutes for most foods.\n\nThis is my new workhorse for healthful easy meals.\n\nI'm even making home-cooked meals more often, that's from a lazy procrastinator like me! I want to try cooking a whole chicken, too, and I've amassed a large collection of recipes from the internet.\n\nEasy cooking, easy-cleaning, it runs whisper-quiet, and it's extremely easy to use.\n\nI'm in love with my air fryer."},{"reviewerName":"NH1975","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Horrible non stick","reviewDate":"June 19, 2019","reviewText":"Don’t buy ! Non stick was peeling off after 3 months of light usage. Called manufacturer to do a warranty claim and she told me it would be coming via email. Never came. Tried doing it online. Got the weird response that they would replace it as a “courtesy”, not warranty. Said they would mail a shipping label. Never came. I donated it to charity.

I love this air fryer so far. I just received it and made chicken drummets and meatballs and wow they are so good. This air fryer really works because I had my doubts. This is so perfect I got it in red to match my microwave and keurig and I got this version because although big it’s not wide so I love that. It’s very easy to clean and use. Simple select degrees to cook and minutes to cook and that’s it. Cooks evenly even without the shaking it recommends.

Spend more for something better.","reviewDate":"August 19, 2019","reviewText":"So I’ve owned this now since March 2019. It gets used 3 times a week. Well, the front panel of the fryer bin is broken, dangling from one side. But the biggest issue is, when you pull out the bin, the latch gives way and the bottom part unattaches from the basket and it falls to the floor making a terrible mess. So now when you pull out the fryer bin you have to support it with a hand mitt covered hand. Very annoying and hot! Spend more money for a better quality fryer. Very disappointed with this."},{"reviewerName":"Gary M","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great but watch out","reviewDate":"October 1, 2019","reviewText":"Easy to use and clean. Works great but as soon as you use it a few times you better tighten the screws that hold the handle onto the basket.
