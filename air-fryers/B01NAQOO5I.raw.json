The first was a smaller 3l size. We loved using it instead of trying but found the size inadequate for cooking for more than one to two people (depending on the food type). So we gave it to our son to use at college and ordered a larger sized one. The second one opened on the top and was monstrous in size. The top opening would hit the underneath of our cabinet when opened so we had to use the fryer in a place where there was no cabinets. Though it came with all kinds of gadgets, It was must too big and awkward. So I searched for one that was a larger version of the first and found this one on Amazon. It barely takes up anymore space than the first one but works the same way with the opening a pull out handle on the front. The basket is a little heavier to hold, bot if you want an air fryer that can cook food for at least three to four people in one batch and is simple to use, this will serve your needs well"},{"reviewerName":"A.

The basket has had one little spot where it looked like the coating might have come off. I have only hand washed the basket, and I’ve been very careful with it. I turned over the pork chops that I was cooking, and all of them have black coating all over them. You can clearly see it in the photo. I couldn’t find anyway to contact the company. This air fryer ended up being a huge waste of money. Very disappointed."},{"reviewerName":"Jim Day","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Almost Perfect","reviewDate":"February 2, 2018","reviewText":"I've been enjoying my air fryer for a little over a month and use it 3-4 times a week. I've cooked whole chickens, chicken strips, boneless pork ribs, donuts, lots of french fries and more and everything has come out great. If given a choice I would have rated it 4 1/2 stars, but since that wasn't an option I had to go with 4 stars. The big issue I have that resulted in the loss of the star is the fact that the basket has already started losing some of it's non-stick quality. I have NOT cleaned it with anything abrasive and looking at it you cannot see any difference. However, the first couple of weeks, cleaning it didn't take any hard rubbing and any residue simply wiped off. Now it takes a lot of muscle to get stuff off of the basket. Yes, I do spray the basket with oil before cooking so food doesn't stick. I've had to resort to using parchment paper for most of my air fryer. This helps some, but because there are holes in the parchment paper (to match the holes in the basket) the juices/sauces still get on the basket and are hard to remove. Other than that I think this is an excellent product."},{"reviewerName":"xxplumcrazeexx","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"The only kitchen appliance I have used since I purchased it.","reviewDate":"March 12, 2017","reviewText":"I purchased this air fryer a couple weeks ago and love it. For the past 2 weeks it has been the only kitchen appliance we have used. I love that the kitchen doesn't get heated up and it's simple to use. I have already made chicken wings that took 24 minutes, quesadillas took 10 minutes , Reuben egg rolls took 8 minutes, pizza logs, grilled ham & cheese sandwiches and even apple hand pies. I could go on and on. Makes healthy food in a matter of minutes and leaves no grease smell in your house. The food comes out crispy with less calories than deep frying. The recipe book has some great recipes in it and am looking forward to trying them. I'm excited that it can even make a cake.\n\nIt only needs to preheat for about 3-4 minutes and the basket is dishwasher safe. Makes for easy cleanup. I like that it's big enough for the entire family and also comes with a divider so I can make 2 things at once. The drawer slides in and out easily and you just press the button and the basket releases to place both parts in the dishwasher.\n\nI highly recommend this Air Fryer to anyone looking for one.

Simple Living Products then reached out to me to find out what the issue was. Michelle is the rep that I talked to and she was very helpful. She was very apologetic and assured me that this was a rare occurrence and that she wanted to make sure that I was taken care of for my trouble. Michelle offered me a free upgrade to the digital model and explained that I would have to wait for a little longer because the model wasn't out yet.

Oh my gosh, the clean-up is beyond a breeze. Take the time to season your air fryer as stated in the booklet that comes with it and this gem will never let you down. It takes no time at all to do so and you will appreciate the fact that you did so. I had and still have my other air fryer (no brand mention here) that never mentioned seasoning and I would rate that machine poorly compared to this. The old is boxed up. Done with it. This wonderful machine is very easy to use. I had no learning curve with this as I had a prior machine. I could not be happier with my purchase (Prime Day) and tell others about this. I had my doubts because it was an unfamiliar name and I am telling you, my gamble sure shocked me the first time I used it and continues to do so. If you are on the fence on this one - do yourself a favor and grab it. You will most definitely not be disappointed in the least.

I have cooked pork chops, chicken thighs, rib eye steak, fries, and a whole chicken. It does what it says and it's fast too! I will say only use the cook times that it gives you as a \"guide\" and eyeball what you're cooking (check it halfway) in order to perfect the times. The only things that I don't like is there is no preheat setting and the basket has to be pushed in order to heat up the device. You then have to pull out a hot basket to put your food it. Doable but tedious. Also I use a drizzle of oil for \"crispness\" and it causes smoke to the point that you think something is burning and it isn't. I suggest using a air cleaner or opening a window and using your fans if that happens.

I've used it daily during the month or so I've had it. Easy to clean. No problems inserting and removing the tray (which I heard some people have issues with that on air fryers, so I was pleasantly surprised). Love that you don't really have to preheat it (maybe you're supposed to, but I haven't done it and I've had no issues). I'm guessing it will eventually pay for itself by reducing the amount that I eat out. Wish there was a better guide on times, but I haven't burnt anything yet. Biggest downside is that does seem to work a lot better if stuff is in a single layer rather than piled up, which is no problem if not making food for more than 2 people. Makes me super glad I got the 5+ qt. instead of a 3 qt.\n\nI have not mastered homemade breading yet (flour turns out powdery) but anything premade has turned out amazing (chicken nugs, tater tots, onion rings, pizza rolls, frozen fish, shrimp, clams). Works really well on asparagus. I was even able to reheat leftover battered shrimp in it, and it was crispy second time around so that's really nice being able to save stuff I probably normally would have thrown away."},{"reviewerName":"D.

Unfortunately however, after just 3 uses (with nonstick utensils) there was a small area on the basket insert surface that had lost the nonstick coating. I contacted customer service, sending a photo of the area damaged and the response was prompt and excellent. They shipped a new basket as soon as it was available, and all is well.\nWe love the fryer. It is quieter than others we've tried, and the basket slides in and out perfectly. With another brand we had borrowed to try, we had to wrestle the basket in each time. The digital controls are easy to use and easy to see. Having the accessories come with the fryer is great too. We use the rack and pans often, and it is a real savings to not have had to buy them separately. Temperature and time settings seem to be accurate, and we're cooking up some pretty good food in it!\nHopefully the issue with the coating will be solved, but we found Simple Living's customer service team to be absolutely the best, and our issue resolved fully to our satisfaction."},{"reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Do not purchase!","reviewDate":"October 11, 2017","reviewText":"While I love what this air fryer can do, the quality is awful.

We tried every recipe in the book and ...","reviewDate":"June 14, 2018","reviewText":"I purchased my unit for my family Christmas 2017. After reading many reviews on different units I settled on this particular one. I looked at price versus feedback on may units out there. I didn’t want to invest into a cheap or overly expensive unit and have it sway my opinion on air fryers. My colleagues at work and I had discussed the new fad of air fryers and though that that’s just what it was. Let me tell you when my unit arrived we set it up and began using it. It is AMAZING. We tried every recipe in the book and started experimenting from there. The Pizza in the book is highly recommended by my kids, they love it. Steak, Fires, and Chicken work perfectly. The fryer started out as another novelty machine that you have to find a place to hide when not in use to a staple in my kitchen. Perfect for all family members. This fryer gets more use than the built in microwave. The customer service that the company provides for their product is amazing. It’s as if you are talking to someone next door. We had a heating issue with our fryer and I contacted the company, within days my new unit was at my house without skipping a beat. They didn’t try and sell me something else or turn a cold shoulder, they were more concerned with my happiness. On a side not I was the Guinea pig for all of my colleagues, they all now own the same unit and have similar feedback as I do.

This 5.8 qt. is my 2nd air fryer; Avalon Bay 3.7 qt. was my first. Ordered this one for 2 reasons: wanted a larger size to easily accommodate whole chickens and because the non-stick coating has been wearing off the interior of my Avalon Bay and the accessory pans.\n\nRegarding size, you can see the difference between the Avalon Bay 3.7 qt. and the Simple Living 5.8 in the attached photo.\n\nAs for the non-stick coating, the 2 are completely different types of coatings: Avalon Bay coating looks like it was sprayed on; Simple Living looks like the coating is actually in the pan (metal). I will say the mfg. urges new owners to 'season' the interior of the pan (by heating with a coating of coconut oil) and baskets before using. I did; heartily recommend doing it. (see attached image for how to season fryer)\n\nAn important note-mine came without a user's guide (although it did have the recipe book). Apparently, some of these air fryers were part of a Holiday 'buy' between Amazon and Simple Living; one or other was supposed to add in a user's guide. If you DID NOT RECEIVE the guide, it is very confusing to figure out how to turn on the different presets for all the icons. The answer is the OUTER SILVER RING on the dial sets the temp, timer AND all presets, but until you start turning it most aren't visible. (see attached)\n\nSo far I have only tested this air fryer on a few meals; will say it seems to do a better job cooking food than the Avalon Bay. 'Fried' food was crispier that with the AB; food was juicier; cook time seemed less.\n\nSo far I am delighted with this purchase!"},{"reviewerName":"Mark","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Poor Quality","reviewDate":"March 28, 2018","reviewText":"I really enjoyed air frying but unfortunately this item lasted less than 4 months before it broke.

I have it now for about a month and cook/fry/roast just about all my meals from steaks, whole chicken, pork chops, and roasted veggies. Since I live in Florida, it also has been a convenience not having to turn on the oven and heat up the house. The 5.8 qt is a perfect size to roast a 6 lb chicken, the skin comes out crispy and the inside is tender and moist. I had purchased a hot air fryer cookbook, however, that wasn't really necessary, since I Google how to make certain foods/recipes and am creating my own personal hot air fryer cookbook. Cleaning it is easy, I just let the fry drawer/pan and basket soak over night in sudsy water. Only have one regret, that I hadn't purchased my hot air fryer sooner.

You can adjust the temperature and time while it is cooking. The machine is powerful and makes food crispy. This is a low fat method of cooking as long as you don't drench your food in oil. Just a tad will do. It comes with a booklet of recipes and list of food and cooking times which I copied and taped to the inside of my cabinet for quick reference. Easy to clean. Easy to program. Bright light display that counts down and indicates cooking temperature. Three beeps to notify end of cooking cycle. Turns off automatically.\nCONS: The only drawback is that the fryer does not have an alarm to indicate when the food is half cooked (you have to turn over the food half way through the cooking process). I set a different alarm to notify me when to turn over the food.\nNOTES: Season the tray: 400 degrees for 3 minutes-spray oil and cook for another 2 minutes. Fryer remains non-stick. I rinse/wash the trays right away to avoid food caking on. I use a soft bristle brush to get in the nook and crannies.\nSIZE: FITS: Eight chunky chicken legs across or 4 big salmon steaks (across) or 2 lb bag of french fries (depth)\nIf you need a quick way to cook, this is it."},{"reviewerName":"Kenneth Brown","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Company is terrible to deal with.","reviewDate":"December 27, 2018","reviewText":"Product worked great...until there was a flaw.

The damage was determined to have happened during shipping. Having used it approx.10 times now, I love it and wouldn't trade it for anything.

Ive cooked everything from frozen chicken wings, frozen raw chicken tenders, french fries, fish sticks, frozen french toast sticks (our FAVORITE!), sausage, bacon, etc. I've even been able to reheat leftover french fries and they taste just as yummy as the first time. Its much easier and quicker than preheating and firing up the oven. 4 stars only because the touch screen buttons can be a little tricky sometimes--not to hard, not too light, sometimes you have to find the \"sweet spot\" of the button--or I could just be spoiled to touch screen technology of smart phones/tablets.. either way, It wouldn't stop me from recommending it. We use ours atleast 3-4 times a week."},{"reviewerName":"Taylor Jones","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"!!MAGIC!!","reviewDate":"October 19, 2018","reviewText":"This thing is magic! I was always so afraid of air fryers because they seemed complicated! I was so wrong, this thing is turn key ready to fire up delicious meals within minutes! My go-to favorites are bacon, Wontons and mini pizza dough! The kiddo loves fish sticks! And my man loves tater tots and he has perfected his \"fried\" chicken strips and they are so good!\n\nBeing on a health lifestyle journey and being able to enjoy yummy, delicious foods with out added oil has been amazing!\n\nThere are so many helpful tools within the kit too. The manual with lists of times and temperatures is my favorite. I use the rack for bacon. I've made a mini pizza with one of the pans. And the deep dish is great for baking!\n\nI have recommended this amazing magical item to all my friends and family!

I was a little \"put off\" because I didn't recognize the brands being offered. But this one was the size and wattage we were looking for and the reviews were great so we took a chance. I cook \"clean\" so it's wonderful to have a tool to make healthy food taste amazing. I want to make everything in it. Cabbage, Brussels Sprouts, Potatoes, Chicken Legs, really any kind of veggie or lean meat is so much better in the air fryer. And on top of all of that, it's extremely user friendly and easy to clean.

Since this is the first exposure to air fryer, part of me was skeptical, but it more than lived up to expectations.\n\nI've made several batch of fries and wings, and it came out great. It's great knowing you can create good quality fried food without buying oil in bulk (expensive) and worrying about its proper disposal. It's also perfect for making open-faced melt sandwiches (tuna melt, roast beef melt, etc), since it's much faster than using an oven.\n\nThis appliance is also great for reheating food that otherwise will get soggy in the microwave..including all types of fried food, pizza and other bread-based leftovers.\n\nThe unit is big, enough space to cook 4~6 servings at a time, so it's perfect if you're feeding family or group of friends.\n\nLastly, I had questions to the seller, and the rep (Michelle) was quick to respond, friendly, and handled my inquiry very professionally."},{"reviewerName":"L.

It needs air space to circulate the heat to cook","reviewDate":"February 27, 2018","reviewText":"I like the air fry technology as a whole, and I bought this before I saw the air fryer oven and I though oh no I bought the wrong thing. However I also have a place to use 2 air fryers so o bought that as well, so I am in a good position to say is this one worth it.\nWhen I first got it, we did fries, home made chicken nuggets, grilled sandwiches, and they were all great. However it was not put it in and come back when it’s done. Fries need tossing, sanwhiches need turning and nuggets need flippping, the ultimately the output was great, but I had to cook a bit (ie turn stuff). So then I got the oven with shelf’s that allow you to stack food, and long story short, I still had to flip sandwiches, turn nuggets, but the fries basket rotates so a bit less of that, but it is still not hands free, they get stuck and burnt if you don’t take them out and wiggle. So this product over the oven competitor is great. Fries I suggest smaller spud chunks because they rotate better when you toss them, the larger capacity is needed I think a smaller one would be too small for air circulation, and finally the important question in my mind is clean up.\nThis has a great basket that you put in and out of the cooker, you can undock the internal piece for easy cleaning and it has a bunch of other inserts which I have not used.\nAs for customer service I had a query and they were fantastic, so 5 starts for that.\nSo why only 4 stars, I think that is limited by technology, I would like to shove food in and take it out (I put fries or nuggets in oven and I still got to wiggle them), but if asked would I return this product, no I would not, of asked would be buy again, yes I would, if asked this over the infomercial oven, ummmm! I own both, this one is much much easier to get food in and out with its basket, you got to juggle fries with both this is easier but needs more often, but I don’t need to put an oven glove on to do that."},{"reviewerName":"will jaques","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Five Stars","reviewDate":"March 9, 2017","reviewText":"Absolutely amazing!

It's small enough to fit comfortably on my countertop, underneath my cabinets but large enough to make 6 full sized pork chops at once (using the metal stand for the top 2 chops). I also love how versatile this air fryer is. I can reheat leftovers and they taste like they just came out of the kitchen. Ever try to reheat french fries in the microwave? Not a problem anymore! I also love to make frozen french fries in this because they taste restaurant quality, without all of the nasty oils.\n\nI can also cook entire meals using just this one kitchen appliance.

All I have to do is load it, set the time and temp, push a button, wait for a beep and it is done (unless I am making fries or something that requires multiple stirs or shakes.)

Great product-I sold my oil fryer."},{"reviewerName":"sslat","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Love it","reviewDate":"December 13, 2018","reviewText":"What a great air fryer.

You can prepare quick and easy meals or snacks with little mess to clean up. It comes with a small cookbook (there are many recipes online as well) , pizza pan , cake pan and rack. The only negative aspect of this purchase is that they are 71/4\" in diameter instead of 8\" which doesn't sound like much but gives you much more space for the items you cook.

The microwave doesn’t crisp anything up, and the oven made me nervous because I worried about the kids leaving it on for hours.

Worthless pre-sets!","reviewDate":"August 13, 2018","reviewText":"The outer plastic shell of this small appliance is made of very cheap black plastic. Even though it was held suspended by packaging material, the black plastic is really scuffed up--right out of the box. Don't expect it to come all nice and shiny as shown in the pictures.\n\nI looked at the Simple Living website before I bought this during this summer's Prime Day (and a half), and it gave the appearance of conscientiousness, so I had higher hopes for better quality than I see here--this product sitting on my counter top. Be aware that this is not the quality of a name brand. This will never be a name brand.\n\nBut the machine works. It's not exactly quiet, but it holds heat and odors inside. There is no way to gauge how much air circulates around inside, as I don't have anything to compare it to. But I have found that I've been getting my best results from just one setting: High--400 degrees Fahrenheit. I just vary the cooking time.\n\nI do not like that--once I program the machine--it starts up with some other heat and time settings. Then it shuts off and I start again. I can't figure it out....Am I doing something wrong? Or is it the machine? I have only used the manual settings and have not bothered with pre-set temps/times. The pre-sets, (fries, ribs, shrimp, cake, poultry, steak, fish) seem ridiculous to me, as amounts and thicknesses will be so variable that what works one time, for one cook, will be very different the next time, or for another cook. Worthless pre-sets!\n\nAnd my machine does not beep, (as the instructions claim), when the cooking is complete.\n\nOpening the basket door, sliding out, sliding back in, is a sensitive procedure that requires TLC and a very precise angle to get it just right.\n\nClean up is not hard--if you are not a messy person. There are way too many ins and outs on the fryer pan, (exposed parts between the inside surface and the outside plastic), to make cleaning easy--even though you can put this in the dishwasher. And if you do put the pieces in the dishwasher, they take up a quarter of the space.\n\nDo not underestimate the size of this appliance. It is very large sitting on your counter top or center island. It is too large to fit in any of my cabinets.\n\nHey, just a FYI if you do buy this air fryer. Actually good advice for any air fryer purchase: Buy a quality oil sprayer (hand pump bottle, not a fine mister), because you are going to be spraying the foods with a coating of oil if you want crispness. And have a small amount of coconut oil on hand for priming the very cheap non-stick surface in the pan and basket. For some reason that I do not completely understand, coconut oil has the best molecular make-up for priming. Oh, also beware that \"non-stick\" on this air fryer (and a lot of other air fryers), is hardly non-stick."},{"reviewerName":"Wilton Dwight Young Jr.","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great product","reviewDate":"August 12, 2019","reviewText":"Great product"},{"reviewerName":"Scott171","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Highly recommend","reviewDate":"February 22, 2019","reviewText":"Did a ton of research — and even tried another brand of air fryer — before deciding on this unit and couldn’t be happier.

Handles whole 6lb chicken. Have used so far for whole chicken, breaded and unbreaded chicken parts, wings,burgers and fries, both frozen and fresh cut. All came out great, just watch the time and temperature. Mine cooks hot, so times are shorter than those listed in most cookbooks. You can check food constantly without worrying about losing temperature. Very convenient and avoids messing up the regular oven with chicken and meat splatters. Also don't have to wait forever for it to preheat. Easy to keep clean putting pan and basket in dishwasher. The drawer pan however is already losing its \"non-stick\" coating. Peels off in dime-sized chunks. So, don't use the drippings if yours has the same problem. The pan isn't used for cooking and I don't use drippings so it doesn't matter."},{"reviewerName":"Lydia Hall","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Fantastic product.

However, it also came with a divider and a wire rack for which there were no directions. I've used it twice, which is enough to tell me that there is a learning curve with this product. French fries came out very tasty, although I found that it took longer than suggested. I think I probably put too many fries in there at a time, and didn't shake them enough while cooking. But that was easily resolved by putting them back in for another 10 minutes and stirring them around a little better. I also cooked assorted chicken parts, for which no one seems to provide a recipe. I guessed at 30 minutes at 400 degrees. They came out very juicy and tasty (I pulled off the skin before cooking and dusted them with Shake And Bake for flavor), but some pieces were still a bit raw in the middle. Next time, I'm going to cook longer and at a lower temperature, and rearrange them part way to make for more even cooking. Also, it advertises a \"recipe book\" that is supposed to come with the fryer. I don't think I'd call a seven-recipe pamphlet a \"recipe book.\" Fortunately, I bought a 130-recipe book with the fryer. Looking forward to experimenting a bit more."},{"reviewerName":"janet wilson","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"So far I like it.

I loved it until the knob broke off and the whole thing stopped working. I knew I wanted another air fryer and one that could cook more food at once. I was unsure about ordering a brand that I wasn't familiar with, but I took a chance on it. It has been the best kitchen small appliance purchase I have ever made. I use this far more than my stove, oven or microwave. I'm thinking about getting rid of my toaster oven now because I very rarely use it.\n\nFrozen foods are easily tossed in, a couple buttons are pushed, and then I walk away until it beeps. I can shake it if I want to, but that's usually not necessary. Gardein products and frozen french fries come out excellent.\n\nToss in some corn on the cob, spritz with a little oil spray, sprinkle on salt and pepper if you like, set it and wait until it beeps.\n\nToss in baby carrots, brussel sprouts, or other veggies, spritz with a little oil or veg broth, and you get delicious roasted vegetable.\n\nPut down a little parchment paper, leaving some room for air flow, and bake cookie dough or biscuits from a tube.\n\nRoasted chickpeas are terrific and really easy. The kids and I snack on them as is or I add them to wraps and salads.\nDrain a can of chickpeas\nPut the moist chickpeas in a bowl and season however you wish (we really like taco seasoning, nutritional yeast, or poultry seasoning and garlic salt). Be sure to shake them up to get seasoning on all of them.\nDump in air fryer and cook at 380 until crisp, shaking the basket once or twiice or not at all.\nSuper easy!\n\nRoasted potatoes or french fries are also super simple. Just wash and cut your potatoes, toss in the air, spritz with a little oil or broth (I find oil spray works best), season, and cook.\n\nIf you are peeling potatoes for a recipe, toss the washed peels in the air fryer with salt and pepper for a tasty, crispy snack. I like to top mine with a vegan cheese sauce.\n\nFor things that are coated or battered, you will find that it doesn't do as well with a wet batter that will drip through the basket and stick, but there are accessories you can buy to get around that. Something more like a shake and bake coating works best. But you will want to work with your recipes. Sometimes, they are a bit dryer than baking or frying. I have successfully battered soy curls and seitan for chicken style strips, as well tofu.\n\nLook up air fried tofu recipes. You will want to use an extra firm variety. It's a breeze! I've even done it as simply as marinating in barbecue sauce and then tossing in the fryer. A few minutes before it is done, you can toss in some chopped or sliced pineapple to go with it.\n\nI bought some metal taco racks/stands that just so happen to fit perfectly in this fryer, so I've made bomb tacos.\n\nI have also been successful at making taquitos in this, just be sure to heat your tortillas before rolling and put in the fryer seam-side down.\n\nVegan burgers and patties cook great in the fryer and you can add some vegan cheese and buns towards the end so the cheese melts and the bread toasts.\n\nAs for oil, I had envisioned an air fryer canceling out my use of oil entirely, but that didn't happen. Some foods just don't cook as well without it, such as potatoes. However, I have found that it only takes a small spritz, far less than I would use otherwise. Some foods can cook just as well with other types of moisture such as vegetable broth or even water. The chickpeas, for example, don't need any sort of oil. They are already moist from their own water, and they turn out perfectly.\n\nFrozen waffles, frozen soft pretzels, crisping up something you have cooked in the microwave (baked potatoes for example) are all super convenient with an air fryer. It even brings leftover restaurant fries back from soggy to tasty!\n\nMine did suddenly stop working right before the warranty ran out. I contacted the company and they sent me a replacement with no hassles.

We cooked breaded chicken thighs and without question, it was the tastiest, most succulent, perfectly crispy chicken we have ever eaten without the negative health effects of pan or deep fat frying. The preparation was easy and the timer was spot on for the finished product. We enjoyed this multiple times and had guests who also loved them. However, after 11 months, it stopped heating yet the digital display and fan were working. We contacted Simple Living. Michelle responded and requested we answer some questions and take a picture of the heating element. As soon as I provided that plus a short description of the problem she quickly responded and said they would replace the unit with a new one immediately. They weren't certain what the malfunction was as it wasn't obvious but just advised us to dispose of the unit rather than go through the efforts of returning it and waiting for a repair or a new one in exchange. We had several more email correspondence just about logistics of the sending the new one. All of my questions were answered well before I rechecked my email. She was so cordial, I never questioned her sincerity about her concern for us. We couldn't ask for better customer service....and chicken. Thanks, Michelle!"},{"reviewerName":"The Mucho Mama","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"The MVP of the kitchen!

Especially during the summer when turning the oven on is unthinkable, this comes in and saves the day to make french fries to go with those cheeseburgers! This reheats food like a dream (i.e. egg rolls, breads etc) My husband and I even make our own tortilla chip using this air fryer and it comes out perfect every time, restaurant quality. The only item I want to add to the wish list for the next model is to make the temperature reach 425 degrees, otherwise this machine is awesome. It's so east to clean (hot tip: line underneath the removable basket with tin foil for super easy clean up!

Little did we know that we would fall in love with such an amazing kitchen tool! We have used our air fryer multiple times a day, everyday. We found out that we are able to make baked potatoes, to whole chickens, and our personal favorite, fries and chicken strips! It has a large basket, easy to use touch panel and has easy clean up. It surprisingly doesn’t take up a lot of room either. Not to mention, it’s a nice sleek design. After using it for quite a few months, our machine malfunctioned. I immediately sent an email to the company telling them about our sad news that the fryer was not functioning. I very quickly got an email back asking to send a video and a couple of photos so they can see what was wrong. I got a response and they said they would send us a new air fryer unit since it was covered under warranty. They were very pleasant to speak with! We got our new air fryer and life again is fantastic! We are so glad we have this tool in our kitchen. We can’t live without it and I would highly recommend getting one for your kitchen too!"},{"reviewerName":"BlessedSunflower","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great air fryer!

We’ve had it for a few months and I really wanted to know my thoughts before writing a review.\n\nWe have a family of 5, kids are young adults and this is big enough to accommodate our needs.

It's just my husband and me, but it's really nice to be able to cook enough food for both of us plus some leftovers in this HUGE basket! My favorite things to make are tortilla chips, frozen gyoza and roasted potatoes. You do need to use some oil spray (or toss your food in a drizzle of oil before cooking) in order to get the \"fried\" effect, but it's so much healthier than the alternative! I have yet to cook an entire chicken, but that is definitely in my near future! I second the comment in Jane's review about lining the lower basket with some foil before inserting the fry basket - makes clean up a breeze! I highly recommend this product!"},{"reviewerName":"saddlebroke","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Excellent customer service makes this the air fryer to buy!","reviewDate":"March 25, 2019","reviewText":"I received this as a birthday gift, and was so excited because even though I had asked for a different brand (only because I hadn't heard of this company) it looked like a perfect size. When I used it for the first time, I noticed the LED temperature display had some lights that weren't working properly so I decided to call customer service to see what could be done. How refreshing to speak to Michelle, who was efficient and kept me informed all along the way about a resolution. Though her engineers had never seen this issue before, they quickly diagnosed it and Michelle assured me that while the malfunctioning lights wouldn't impact functionality, she would feel better if she sent a replacement unit. When I asked whether I should package up the original unit, she said there was no need...she didn't want me to go through the hassle. So on top of the outstanding customer service, the unit itself is awesome. I've made apple fritters and bagels so far, and have a long list of other recipes to try! Oh- and the icing on the cake for me...Michelle told me they are a family-owned company, located just a few miles away from where I live. I love supporting local, family-owned businesses!!"},{"reviewerName":"Tamera Jenkins","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Simple Living AIr Fryer is Simply Fantastic!","reviewDate":"March 29, 2018","reviewText":"I'm so glad I decided to buy the Simple Living 5.2L Air Fryer. It has definitely changed the way I cook. What a pleasure it is to cook things like fries, onion rings, hamburger patties, chicken and anything I would have normally fried and not have to clean the stove top. Not only that but It is amazing how good the food is with little to no oil at all. My arteries have to be happy about that, Lol. My husband likes the way the food tastes so much that he wants me to make everything in it. I tried frozen corn cobbets last night and was really impressed with how fresh it tasted. Fried Okra is fantastic and my husband and granddaughter ask for it for a snack. Last night we were talking about needing another one so we can cook more things at the same time.

My deep fryer was going out, so I decided I wanted to replace it with an air fryer (which I then received as a birthday gift). The capacity is close to double that of my deep fryer basket, which means fewer \"batches\" to cook for my family of 5. I made frozen waffle fries, and they tasted like the \"real deal\" with very little oil. I was actually so excited to try it that I used the air fryer before the oil-mister I ordered came in. So, I put the fries in a bowl, drizzled oil & stirred. That was WAY too much oil for the air fryer, which just shows me how little oil is actually required. The fries were perfect, and I can't wait to try other things. I'm actually trying to think up excuses to \"fry\" foods!"},{"reviewerName":"W. Bennett","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Does not cook evenly","reviewDate":"July 18, 2019","reviewText":"This air fryer does NOT roast evenly. Pizza overcooks on top while remaining RAW on the bottom. Problem is that the inner pan sits so low in the drawer that there is virtually NO air circulation underneath. You cannot rotate pizza to crisp the crust without compromising the toppings! My older, smaller Philips required no turning or rotating the food because there is adequate space for airflow underneath. Also the Philips basket has an open weave pattern that further enhances air flow. I have hardly used the Simple Living but will donate it. Also it is absolutely Humongous!"},{"reviewerName":"Beth Z","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Very user friendly and sturdy!","reviewDate":"August 29, 2018","reviewText":"I recently got the Simple Living 5.8qt Digital XL Air Fryer and it is definitely one of our favorite kitchen appliances!

And let me say...I love it! Our favorite use is making broccoli and cheese tots, crispier than the oven and zero oil. One thing I have found very desirable is it doesn’t put off much heat, so I have been using it more as summer has come to avoid turning on my oven. The only downfall I have found is that it’s so big it doesn’t fit in any of my cabinets for storage (would fit in the cabinet but won’t fit through the door), so it’s on my counter all the time. But honestly I don’t really care, it’s not an issue for us, but it could be if you have limited counter space and nowhere to store it."},{"reviewerName":"Marc Engle","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Amazing customer service and a fantastic product!","reviewDate":"February 28, 2018","reviewText":"When our Air Fryer arrived 3 days before the big game, we were super excited to try it and make all those fried treats for the Super Bowl. We were disappointed to find that the box had shipped without an instruction manual or the cookbook. I hopped on the Simple Living website and shot off an email. Within hours, I had a response from the company. They offered to not only mail a hard copy of the cookbook and manual, but to send a PDF of each so that we could use the fryer immediately. Absolutely fantastic response time and willingness to solve the minor issue.\n\nAs for the use of the fryer, it is very simple and easy to use. It took some experimentation on our part to get things cooked the way we liked, but that is in no way fault of the machine! It cooks evenly and completely.

I had read on a FB page for air-fryer tips and recipes that people said you can't just have one - if you buy one, before you know it, you'll buy a second. So, I figured I'd get a digital and a manual. I did, and I'm glad. The price was right, and both are just wonderful. I always get sick when I'm at a restaurant and eat fried food - all that grease, sitting in the fryer and being reused upsets my stomach. But, I love the crisp, crunchy texture of fried foods. With this, I have the best of both worlds - foods cooked in air-fryers really are crispy - and they are healthier (no upset stomach, aftertaste, etc.) My favorite foods to prepare in an air-fryer are potato chips (took several tries until I perfected it), French fries, apple fries (breaded with graham cracker crumbs), roast chicken (unbelievable), steak (perfection), and I even baked a chocolate cake in mine!

The basket is a bit heavy, takes some practice to remove it when full. It's a learning curve. I think I'll be pleased. Tried fried chicken drumsticks and french fries the first day. Made a mistake of putting too much flour dredging on the chicken and the fan blew some out and the inside got a little messy. Chicken was very good, juicy and nicely browned. The fries were fine too. Seems important to check time, things got done sooner than I'd expected. There were no instructions for using the wire rack included, the divider for the basket is pretty self explanatory.

They sent me out a brand new replacement air fryer after a few questions about my broken unit. This was all in the span of one week. I cannot explain how much Ive missed using this product in that period, that most of what I eat is cooked in there. It's been a very long time since Ive seen such excellent customer service like this and wholeheartedly recommend this companies products to everyone!\n\n(UPDATE) Im reducing this to 1 star because the fryer died almost 4 months to the day of receiving it. I was using this almost every night. Last night it popped the fuse in my wall socket. Reset the fuse and the fryer no longer gets hot. Outside the return and support window. Extremely upset. Good thing I have a microwave to fall back on. Probably worth it to spend more and get a quality unit next time.\n\nIt should be illegal for me to step into any kitchen. I cannot cook to save my life and if I tried I would probably kill someone. If it werent for the microwave I would probably be dead. I use my oven for storage and my dishwasher has been run 3 times in 10 years.\n\nI was gifted a Breville oven many years ago and I probably use that as much as my microwave, but to reheat pizza of course.\n\nI decided at the end of last year to start eating healthier and stop eating hot pockets....yeah I eat like a 12 year old. A friend of mine got an air fryer and she kept telling me how amazing it was and that I could use this and eat healthier. I got this on one of the special deals for $99 and figured that was a decent price to spend on something I might never use.\n\nI cleaned off my counter and placed this next to my Breville. They seemed happy together and understood where each others place was in my eating life. They werent angry and there wasnt any fighting. Yeah, this thing has a big footprint too.\n\nI didnt really have much in my freezer(my other favorite item in the kitchen) that I could make in this thing so I went out with a list when I went shopping. Unfortunately, that happens like once a month so it sat for a while before I got to try it.\n\nFirst thing I tried were fried fish things(because I usually made them in the breville). They came out fantastic! Crispy on both sides and cooked all the way through. Half the time as the Breville with no flipping and no messy Pam sprayed foil.\n\nThen I made cocktail hotdogs, you know, pigs in a blanket. WOW, these were flaky on the outside and cooked perfectly on the inside.\n\nNext I tried crinkle cut fries. Burnt Fail! You cant rely on the cooking time in the instructions or on the bag of the fries. Second time I tried making these I burnt them again. Third time I made these I again burnt them. Im chalking it up to crappy fries.\n\nUp next were wings, not just regular wings but BBQ wings. Another excellent cooking experience. Came out delicious.\n\nThen I tried empanadas. These also came out great. Crispy and flaky on the outside, inside nice and hot and cooked. I liked very much.\n\nWent back to the store and got different fries. This time it was waffle fries and they came out awesome the first time.\n\nIm not going to go through everything else Ive tried but so far this fryer has been a life saver. Its probably one of the best things Ive ever bought myself.\n\nOh I should probably mention the cleaning. Its EASY! When they say \"no stick\" they mean it. After everything Ive made I just give it a quick rinse in the sink and a wipe with a paper towel. Everything is like new again. I did go through the initial directions of oiling it and heating it up before using, not sure if that helped but I like following directions. That being said, Ive never put any oil in this thing since and I feel healthier every time I use it. Ok, so maybe what Im actually cooking isnt healthy, but at least Im not adding to it."},{"reviewerName":"Melva Hampton","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Excellent product, customer service and a great buy","reviewDate":"January 29, 2018","reviewText":"I absolutely LOVE this air fryer.

Next I did a whole chicken that was around 5 pounds. The recipe said 75 minutes at 390 degrees. After 45 minutes I checked it and the bird was starting to get a beautiful golden brown. At 60 minutes I checked again and it was starting to look like a rotisserie chicken. At 75 minutes, the machine turned off and I left it in there until everything else was ready. It was unbelievable, so juicy and golden brown with a crunchy skin. This item is going to get used nearly everyday. I'm doing pork chops today.

The removable tray holds the basic no stick perforated basket that allows the air to flow throughout the cooking chamber. Various pans and racks can be placed in the basket to accommodate cooking whatever it is you are preparing. The advantages are faster cooking time as you are heating less space and moving the hot air around. It is also very easy to pull out the basket to check on your cooking progress and make adjustments. This is a pain with a normal oven, but super simple and convenient to do here. This little portable convection oven has huge advantages over conventional ovens. The term \"air fryer\" is not informative, so that is the why of this introduction.\nThe Simple Living 5.8 qt unit is quite satisfactory in all respects. It seems well made and is very functional. No negative issues at all, it is all good. Sure it is large, I had to make room in my pantry to put it away when not is use, but I do the same with my multi-cooker. The included rack and two pans are quality and useful. I am supplementing them with other containers I already have that easily work in the basket. My wok steamer basket and silicon strainer have been particularly useful. The unit does not overheat so I can clean it up and put it away immediately after use.\nI did my first low and slow with a large chuck roast. I ground my seasonings, added olive oil, rubbed it onto the roast, set the temperature to 400 for 5 minutes to sear it and give it color. I then set the temperature to 180 for 4 one hour sessions. The meat come out perfect and there was virtually no drippings. Clean up took only 1 minute with hot water and a little Dawn.\nIn summary, I find this little convection oven to be very useful and will likely not use my conventional oven again. The Simple Living company has delivered a good product at what I perceive to be a good value. I recommend this product and this vendor."},{"reviewerName":"Lori","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"... Mother's Day and we as a family have really enjoyed it.

You need to check things often as the cookbook times are off. For the size, it doesnt seem to cook much food. I find that I dont use it as often as I would like because I cant fit enough in it for a family of 4. I like it for the frozen and fried food reheating.

Now that it's here, I could not be happier. The gold standard for any kind of fryer is: how well does it do french fries? Without a doubt, the Simple Living Digital XL Air Fryer excels. French fries come out golden brown, crunch on the outside and soft on the inside. Just like a grease fryer without the grease! I have also, so far, cooked breaded shrimp which also came out perfect.\n\nThis model is big. But there is plenty of room in the fryer to cook enough food for 4 without any problems. The control on front is very easy and simple to use. There are presets for a number of different types of food to cook. You may find they work just right for you or, like me, they need a slight variance to get that just-right doneness.\n\nOne feature that I particularly like: When I take the basket out in the middle of cooking to give it a shake, I can put the basket back in and the fryer starts up from where it left off. No buttons to push or settings to make. Very nice! Oh, and one other thing...When it finishes cooking the fryer automatically turns off. No worries about extra, extra crispy french fries!\n\nLastly, the device is light, relatively quiet, and emanates very little cooking smell (compared to grease fryers).\n\nOverall, if your counter space is very limited, then I would suggest a smaller mode.

I love to cook veggies and frozen meats in this (think turkey hamburger patties, frozen fish, chicken nuggets, etc). I like that it comes with the cooking accessory pans. Everything comes out yummy, and it's easy to use and clean. It's a little bulky, but it doesn't bother me. I mostly set my own settings for heat and time - I don't use the auto modes much. If i get tired of looking at it (I hate cluttered counters), I just stick it in the pantry until I'm ready to use it again."},{"reviewerName":"Grammy","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great cooking and clean up.","reviewDate":"October 4, 2018","reviewText":"Once I cooked in this air fryer 2-3 times I was totally satisfied. I now have the confidence to try more categories besides French fries, and other easier foods. I have cooked a small pork roast and was very satisfied with the results. I am now choosing the air fryer before my toaster oven and large stove oven. Cornish game hens were beautiful and very tasty. Easy clean up is a 10 star plus. Why would I use my other 2 ovens for just my husband and I? I am soon to roast a chicken, and know that the results will be as successful. Very happy I purchased this air fryer."},{"reviewerName":"~Wendy!","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Large capacity, simple to use!","reviewDate":"November 2, 2018","reviewText":"This air fryer is amazing!! From the outside it seems like it is the same size as my last one, but it fits so much more food! It’s easy to cook with, cooks evenly and quickly, and makes the most delicious meals! It is a bit large to keep on the counter if it’s not being used, but it’s easy to take in and out of the cupboard at meal times! I love the accessories that came with the kit, the basket, pan, and wire rack make cooking multiple items so much easier!

We had been on the fence about buying one for about a year when a relative told us how much he enjoyed his. We have made zucchini fries, pizza, mini perogies & pigs in a blanket; they all came out good. The instructions for this machine could have been a bit better (took me a minute or two to figure out there was a button to push to get the basket out) as to how to use but thanks to a 5 minute YouTube video we were up and running quickly. We can cook food in about 1/2 the time of a regular oven without giving up crispiness."},{"reviewerName":"Brown","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great Purchase for a Fantastic Air Fryer","reviewDate":"June 11, 2019","reviewText":"This air fryer is the BEST.

Set the temp to 380° and set the timer to 22 minutes, flipped the chicken half way through the cook time and the chicken came out golden brown and juicy.

I even talked my mom into getting one. We had a countertop convection oven and this takes the place and does the job so much better and quicker. I’ve cooked steaks...amazing, frozen burgers and fries (together)...awesome and quick, fried chicken...perfect, and cooked and reheated numerous foods...everything always turns out great. I would caution to not leave foods sitting in here after it’s done as something crispy can turn soggy with the steam. We don’t even have a microwave anymore, this can do it all and keep your foods crispy.\n\nThe size of this is a bit large, be sure to measure. It’s no louder than most microwaves.

The basket and pan clean up super easy!!! I can usually just use a paper towel and wipe the pan clean.\n\nThe recipe book that came with this unit is really nice quality with color photos, but there are only 9 recipes. I am having to learn how to alter my recipes so they work well in this unit, but I have had a number of successes with it. The first thing I made in it was some thin fries. We made 3 lbs., divided into 2 batches, and 3 of us ate every one of them! They were really good! I have also baked homemade biscuits (7-8 min. at 400, brush with butter and turn halfway through), baked chicken drumsticks, 20 minutes at 370 (spray with oil and turn halfway through), onion rings, breaded mushrooms, and my favorite, BBQ seasoned potato chunks, 15 minutes at 370 (shake halfway through).\n\nI had really struggled with which brand and model of air fryer to purchase, but since I am often cooking for family or other guests, I decided I wanted a large one. The XL Philips brand was $300, this one was $170! So far, I am very happy with my decision."},{"reviewerName":"Juley Karns","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Perfection","reviewDate":"August 23, 2018","reviewText":"I have a small family and often I fix a meal for one.

Its how I was taught to cook. So anything fried was done in cast iron. I'm a die hard when it comes to frying with Crisco in my pans. They heat evenly and make for the best fried....well just about anything. Recently I had weight loss surgery. This meant no more fried foods for me. I love the taste and crunch but my body wasn't allowed the grease. When I heard about air fryers I was pretty excited to try one. I wanted to see if I could truly get the same taste from a air fryer. One of my first concerns was finding one that was large enough to feed my entire family. It is my husband and myself and our 5 children. I didn't want anything that I had to make two off because the basket wasn't large enough. This Simple Living air fryer is amazingly large. I love the digital read out. It's really easy to understand. It came wish a cook book with recipes but honestly I went straight to google. My first meal was chicken legs. I made and amazing recipe I found online. I was able to fit 20 small legs in the basket and probably could have fit more. They came out amazingly crispy and tasted amazing. The best part no Crisco! This cleans really easily and I love all the extra baskets. The cook time is cut in half making it a great option when youre running late. Even better when youre in mid summer and it's 90+ outside using an air fryer means you don't have to turn on your stove. I am looking forward to frying a chicken. yes, a whole chicken! That's next on the list. If youre trying to eat healthier this is a great option."},{"reviewerName":"J&K Honaker","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"GREAT purchase","reviewDate":"October 24, 2018","reviewText":"I have been thinking about getting an air fryer for some time now but wasn't sure it would be worth the purchase. Then my neighbor bought one and I watched her easily make scrumptious wings. She got the one at Costco that is about $100 cheaper and I was tempted to get that one but, after researching several, decided to try this one because I wanted the bigger basket so we could make chicken, fish fillets, etc.\nSo far, we have made cornesh game hens, wings, zucchini fries and a bloomin' onion. All came out great. I just purchased some fish fillets and other stuff to try. This is a sleek unit, for the size, and is very easy to clean! We are very happy with our purchase."},{"reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"This fryer will cook just about anything!","reviewDate":"April 12, 2018","reviewText":"I used to eat deep fried foods all the time, like, daily. Eventually, I fell out of love with doing so, 20 minutes to preheat the fryer, standing over it to keep an eye on the food, replacing a gallon of oil every month or two. So, I mostly stopped eating fries, onion rings, mozarella sticks, and the like for years. I had always wanted an air fryer, but it was never in the front of my mind. I saw an air fryer while walking through a store one morning, and then went home and started researching what were the best, and what would suit my needs. I wanted something big, for making entire bowls of fries for myself and friends. I ended up buying this model, and I LOVE it. I use it several times a week, and it will cook just about anything you throw at it. It has produced some of the best frozen fries I have ever made. It produces near perfect mozarella sticks. I use it to reheat and slightly crisp McDonald’s fries when I get home with them, as well as McNuggets. I have cooked hamburgers in it, which came out great. My only complaint would be that it doesn’t do well with fresh cut fries, and I would be willing to bet there is simply something I am doing wrong. Also, cleaning it is super easy, and takes about two minutes, whereas a deep fryer could take me an hour to clean. I have found that this replaces many of the functions of my oven, toaster over, and deep fryer. Well worth the purchase."},{"reviewerName":"Reta J.

Big surprise was frozen biscuits, turned out great in only 10 minutes and no heating up the oven. This product will only increase in value during the summer by avoiding the oven heating.
