It does have the plastic smell when in use but I think it is getting less and may go away completely. I have made chicken thighs which I had to turn over half way since the skin was getting too dark but I think that was because of the seasoning I used that was burning but the skin was crispy and the chicken super juicy! I also have made frozen breaded chicken tenders (the oven ready kind) they came out nice and crispy and browned. I got this because I live alone and hate using the oven and heating the house for a single serving and I hate toaster ovens since they take forever to cook in. This is perfect for one person."},{"reviewerName":"Michelle My Bell ♥","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"This little gadget is awesome! I purchased it for my office at work","reviewDate":"June 20, 2018","reviewText":"This little gadget is awesome! I purchased it for my office at work, as I used to cook my sweet potato fries in a convection oven where I would have to go into the break room multiple times to flip my fries and reset the timer for additional cooking. This air fryer has made my life so much simpler and has eliminated all of that! My frozen sweet potato fries now only take 15 min to cook, I can keep the fryer in my office, and after about 5 uses, I can say it cooks very well and gives my fries (and tots) a delicious crisp fried taste. I have already encouraged several of my co-workers to purchase one, and I'll probably buy a larger one for my house down the road. This size is ideal for one or two servings, so if you are feeding more people, I would recommend a larger air fryer. Clean-up also couldn't be easier! It's adorable and a simple tool, I am very happy with my purchase!"},{"reviewerName":"Brenda Robbins","rating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Two Stars","reviewDate":"May 28, 2018","reviewText":"Basket insert tray finish is coming off after only 1 month of use☹️"},{"reviewerName":"AL","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"I've always loved wings and over the years have tried all the ...","reviewDate":"June 10, 2018","reviewText":"I've always loved wings and over the years have tried all the methods to make a good wing - over, microwave then oven, crock pot, crock pot then oven, grill, etc. yet, all I managed to do was go through a ton of batteries for my smoke detector.

I'm feeling better about the way I am able to cook healthier food as I use no oil and do not fry at all on my stove top. I bought several colors of the DASH for family gifts with rave reviews. Retired parents, Sis with empty nest, and Son with small daughters who love the ease of cooking and cleanup - so easy with a rinse or even tossing in the dishwasher's top rack. Would like to say that the design is so cute on my kitchen cabinet and the food comes out nicely browned on the outside and not overcooked on the inside.

After unwrapping it today I cut up some potatoes to try making homemade French fries. The timer worked as promise the temperature was easy to set. These were the crispiest fries I have ever had, and to mention they were made with no grease!\n\nThe cleanup and reuse is easy and I have to say my family and kids love it. I would highly recommend buying this item as a healthy alternative to frying: especially now that spring is here and trying to get back in shape and not giving up fried foods.\n\nI had to come back to this after day two with this item. I just used it to make breakfast: taco omelet with spinach, potatoes, tomatoes, and a dash of cheese. I am very impressed with the ease of use and the fact that the clean-up is so easy. The little unit is also not so bulky so that storing it doesn't require a lot of real-estate. The color is also cool too: my mother in law came in and immediately said what the heck is that!

When I got down to it, you put 1 layer of 1/4 fries onA the bottom of the basket (10 fit), cook 10 minutes shake up and cook 10 more minutes. It would take 2-3 hours to cook one large potato cut up into fries. 400 degree for that long not energy efficient. Fries can be made in the oven with less time and done all at once. I looked at the frying times and realized this is an energy and time drain. I thought it would be fast and easy. You can't leave it running, so there is no plus to using it that I know of.

So much faster & energy efficient than in the oven! Other reviewers said it had a bad smell upon first use, but I had no issues with that at all. It was a breeze to clean afterward & I could see the grease that baked out on the cooking tray & in the basket. There are only three in my family, so it's the perfect size for us.

Makes fantastic homemade chicken nuggets, \"fried\" vegetables, fish, roasted new potatoes....everything comes out wonderfully crispy and/or browned. It even makes a humble veggie burger into a restaurant quality meal!\nI like the food so much better without all the oil that you have to use with frying or even sauteing.\nIt's super easy to use and to clean.\nIt is attractive - I have the turquoise color, and it looks good on the counter. It is very small and hardly takes up any space.\nIt is very convenient, and I don't have to heat up the oven or stove to just make a quick lunch.\nJust a few things to think about:\nThe timer knob is black, and the dot to set the time is just a raised black bump. It is really hard to see when you are turning the knob. I was thinking of putting a dot of paint on there or something so I can actually see it.\nAlso, this fryer is very small. It only has room to cook a serving for ONE.\nIt's perfect if you just want to make a meal for yourself, but if you want to cook dinner for two or more, I'd recommend getting the bigger size.\nOverall, this is the best little appliance!

The first time I used it, I loaded it up with frozen fish patties and french fries. Took about a half an hour and had to shake a couple of times. I have learned that it is best to cook 1 item at a time. 1st the fish fillets, about 15-20 min. When finished, I would put fries in. By the time I finish the fish, the fries are ready. Fries take 10-15 min. It's winter now and I still use the air fryer. It's faster and I prefer the crispness over oven cooked. I was very disappointed that the handle came off after about 6 months after use. I wrote the company and they offered to replace the fryer with the newer model. I was surprised they would send a whole new unit rather than just the basket. When the new fryer came, I understood why. The handle design is much sturdier with a removable basket. The digital display is so much easier to read. Thanks so much Dash, this air fryer has become my favorite kitchen gadget.

I’ve cooked everything from basic French Fries to Pork Chops in this marvelous cooking device. Only catch to this is “cooking times”. There is a “learning curve” shall we say? I’ve personally been making a list of what food, temp & time for the wide variety of things I’ve cooked in this. Kids love it for its ability to cook chicken nuggets & fries to perfection in 15 minutes. I personally was amazed at pork chops in about 18 minutes at 400 degrees - not a dried out hunk of leather! But a perfect toasted “skin” with still moist inside and delicious with the wide variety of different seasonings and coating of mustards, Parmesan cheese, etc. I’m actually looking to buy a BIGGER model now being as impressed as I am with this one.\nJust remember, cooking times will vary here and there depending on what’s cooking. I’m pretty sure times & temps will vary on various models too. Clean up is a breeze as well. Also considered just buying another of this same model to have multiple cooking going on. OH!

She said she cooked them in the air-fryer. I had been hearing about an air-fryer for some time, but had never jumped on the band wagon. I didn't need another kitchen gadget. But those taquitos were tasty and I wanted more. For the price, I didn't mind playing around and testing it out. All I can say is food tastes so much better than using the exact same ingredients and popping it in the oven. Seasoned chicken breasts are fabulous. French Fries are so much healthier than deep frying and just as good as take-out with a little seasoning.\nThis is a little air-fryer. I can fit in two small chicken breasts or one large one. I can cut up a single large potato for the french fries. It's the perfect size for a single person serving. I like that it's not fancy. There are two knobs; 1 to set the\ntemp and 1 to set the timer. Personally I use a separate timer to keep me on track. Last, it doesn't heat up the kitchen.\nIt doesn't get hot on the outside.

First, it's VERY small. I wanted one that was for a single or two person household but honestly, this doesn't fit much at all. Even a single small fish filet barely fit. And since you really cannot layer most food, you'd have to cook 2-3 batches and keep each batch warm while other cooked. Even if you are cooking for one that's a hassle. Even French fries, which you can layer, didn't do well. You have to shake them partway through but there's not room for them to move when you shake the basket. It also didn't cook stuff all the way through but burned the outer layer, no matter what temperature I used. I'm not sure if it was underpowered or if mine was defective. It was very easy to clean and the sound wasn't as loud as others indicated...at least not to me. The control knob was VERY hard to read. There is a very tiny dot to show what time you put it on and if almost need a magnifying glass and super bright light to see it to adjust the time.

It's very basic. Not digital but with knobs and the timer knob on the front side is so hard to see you need a magnifying glass. Also the pull out drawer on this model does not have a basket to lift and shake around the food halfway through as most instruction videos show, and you really need to do that or somehow turn the food over because the heat only comes from the top. You will have several fails at first, so be prepared to waste some food, but once you get the timing right (don't even bother to turn the temperature below 400) the foods that turn out best are fries or tots and chicken nuggets."},{"reviewerName":"LilyGirl","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Totally awesome air fryer for one person meals and snacks - just buy one now!","reviewDate":"May 31, 2018","reviewText":"I have had this for awhile now, and some days I wonder what I did before this came into my kitchen!

The only time it didn't work - I didn't know my husband had unplugged it haha! He laughed when I said oh no I'm going to cry if this air fryer died.

Also, it \"cooks hot\"...the picture is of bacon cooked at the recommended temp and for just *half* the time stated in the accompanying recipe book. Crispy!\n\nHowever, I have played with it enough where I will give it 4 stars. You just have to know it cooks VERY hot so check your food often and use lower temps. Also, reply on a phone or other timer and not the device. It does work well, just watch for overcooking and the lousy timer. I have gotten used to it and do use it almost everyday and enjoy it. Just beware of overcooking.

I've only used it three times thus far, but it's done a great job of cooking items (shrimp, onion rings, chicken strips, frozen hash browns) both quickly and thoroughly. I'm completely happy with the fryer.\n\nOnly three minor negatives: 1) It did let off some rather unpleasant electrical smells on the first couple of uses. At first it smelled like burning wiring or something, but it has diminished to almost nil with additional use. It did not affect the taste of the food., 2) The timer knob and scale is very difficult for my aging eyes to read. First off the print is minuscule on the scale and secondly the knob has nothing other than a little molded dot in the black plastic. I'd suggest a white dot on the knob for contrast (I'll probably do that to mine). If your eyes are good, or there's lots of light this probably isn't a concern., 3) What color is it? Depending on ambient light and the angle you view it at, this unit is sometimes truly turquoise but other times mint green. The only importance or consideration I gave to the color is the price of the unit (this color was considerably less expensive). Still, it's quite attractive regardless of the color.\n\nEdited 9/12/18: As a followup and having used the fryer a lot I'm overall quite pleased. Only two new observations: 1) The weird electrical smell took longer to go away than I originally thought or hoped, and 2) Foods have begun to stick to the non-stick insert (despite having only been washed with a sponge and detergent + water) This can be reduced by spraying a little oil on it prior to cooking but that does diminish the point to it a bit."},{"reviewerName":"Stephanie Logue","rating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Dies after a few months","reviewDate":"May 20, 2019","reviewText":"This item worked well for about 3-4 months.

However as I go along, I find more to cook in it -- boneless pork chops, chicken breast, etc. The recipe book is almost useless and that is a big mistake the manufacturer made -- not providing a better cookbook.

It's a dial, and sometimes it doesn't start timing unless I dial it up more than 3 minutes or so. The timer would be better if it were digital.

The Box had only a sticker on top of the image, there was no additional \"non-descriptive\" box for my package, and the delivery came in after 8 PM. This could have been a horrible case of package theft because the product (a RED air fryer) was out on display on the box at a very dark time of the day.

Pleasantly short little ding when it's done, about as loud as your average microwave, and let's be honest - it's cute. The only thing I don't like is that over time the little tray did stop holding itself up (for a convection like reheating) and just slides to the bottom now, but that doesn't by any means kill the functionality of the oven."},{"reviewerName":"Miranda","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Be sure to flip everything over and cook long enough and it’s pretty good","reviewDate":"September 3, 2018","reviewText":"Does the job but it takes a while.

The handle and the tray is held together by one measly screw that I'm stuck reattaching constantly, which is pretty annoying when it's hot and the food needs to cook further.

Making your own fried foods at home is incredible and takes literally minutes to cook. Unlike a regular oven, you don't need to preheat this.

I've used it every day since. I decided to buy it to try making fried chicken - my mom's favorite, but not the healthiest thing in the world. Three chicken thighs will fit in easily and it's some of the tastiest, juiciest chicken I've ever had. I'm waiting for a cookbook I ordered for more ideas, but I an usually find recipes on the internet. Clean up is so easy, it just goes in the dishwasher. Perfect for two and doesn't take up much counter space. A great buy!\n\n8/12/19 Update: So I was using my great fryer a few days ago, went to pull out the food and the handle pulled off. It had been loose for awhile, but there was no way to access the screw to tighten it up. And the way the handle fits no way to turn it to screw it back on. So sad.

I followed the breaded (floured) chicken recipe that came with the fryer, and the chicken was black in spots and still floured in others. I cooked until it was just at 165°. I turned it when I was supposed to. It turned out like jerky...very tough.\n\nBecause frozen french fries, onion rings, tater tots, mozzarella sticks, etc. are pre-fried when manufactured, this air fryer might do well with them, but you are still eating fried foods When you air fry them. You can only make a serving of frozen fries at a time. It would take too long to make 2 servings. The first batch would be cold by the time the second batch was cooked. I tried pre-cooked breaded okra and spent 30 cooking it. It went in the trash because they did not brown at all.\n\nThis will be going back.

I've used it many times and it's perfect for one or two servings. The basket isn't as bit as a full-sized air fryer since it's round instead of oblong, but you can adjust the arrangement of food. For example, instead of wrapping a slice of bacon around a spear of asparagus I cut the asparagus into pieces and wrapped each in a piece of bacon It held about three full chicken wings and cooked them evenly. It has a dial for the timer and temperature instead of digital settings, but I don't think cooking times are that exact so it shouldn't matter and it makes it very simple to operate. The only issue with that is you can't cancel or reduce the cooking time, but you can pull the basket out of the fryer and the timer will still count down even though the heater and fan have stopped. I don't know if this would be allowed in a dorm room, but it would be perfect for a student."},{"reviewerName":"Christina Y","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Looks good, no inner basket, only cooks small quantities","reviewDate":"April 6, 2018","reviewText":"This is my third air fryer, I bought this to replace my old one during a move (gave my old one to my friend). I've also bought one for my mom. I use these things extensively to cook meat, make fries, roast veggies, almost every day.\n\nWhile its got a smaller footprint on my counter and looks super cute, the basket is much smaller which leads to uneven cooking if its more than half full. I have burned items at the top while soggy on the bottom for this reason. My other issue with this item is that while other fryers have a basket you can lift the food out, this one only has a disc with holes that pulls out the bottom, so you have to lift/scoop the food out with tongs or spoon, which is a pain with things like fries. If you try to tip it out the oil will run into the food.

I only hoped it would fry much better than a microwave, and of course it does! What wouldn't? If there was such a thing as a perfect air fryer you would never have to stir the food, but nothing is perfect and even the expensive models ask you to turn the food over once or twice while cooking. This only has 1,000 watts, but with a 1.2 liter cooking basket you're going to have much more available heat than when a 1,500 watt model tries to cook a 5 L basket of food. You can pay a lot more for digital temperature and programmable digital timers, but when you get right down to it, cooking is more of an artform than a science. Setting those numbers to exactly 390 degrees and 18 minutes won't ever guarantee that the food will be right, not when there is so much variability in the quality of the food, the exact amount of the food and how long or how cold it may have been frozen. All of that is why this Dash fryer, with it's mechanical dials cooks every bit as good as the fancy models. I can appreciate the small footprint, and the available colors make it that much nicer (I chose red). For some reason the timer dial cannot be turned backwards, so try not to overshoot the mark you want. Also, I added a dot of white-out to the dial because the pointer dot was black like the rest of the dial. My favorite food to cook in this happens to be Ore-Ida crinkle-cut fries. These include some light seasoning and they brown nicely without a drop of added oil."},{"reviewerName":"peg a leg","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"If I loved it so much, why one star?","reviewDate":"September 7, 2019","reviewText":"I received my Dash air fryer for Christmas and was so excited to use it. It’s the perfect aqua color for my kitchen and the perfect size for making breakfast, lunch, or dinner for myself and my 6 lb. Chihuahua. I’d used other Dash products before and couldn’t be happier with them. (I LOVE my egg cooker) Some things I’ve cooked in my air fryer are: hot dogs, chicken thighs, turkey burgers, frozen fries (Irish and sweet potato) smoked sausage with onions & bell pepper, chicken nuggets—even finished baking some biscuits in it once when my countertop oven went out before they were completely done—and many other things. So why did I give it one star? Because almost immediately the non-stick coating started peeling off, and after only a few months of use, it became so bad I cannot use it. I understand that coating is unhealthy if ingested, and I don’t know how much of it my little dog and I may have already consumed. I have no choice but to throw the fryer away. It honestly baffles me that it has gotten so many four and five star ratings. I always washed it by hand, was careful with it, and never put it in the dishwasher. And as a mother/grandmother who has cooked for a large family for over fifty years, I know my way around a kitchen and certainly know how to take care of my tools and appliances. I loved the convenience of the air fryer and everything else about it, but the faulty non-stick coating makes it useless. That’s too bad. I will miss it, but I will never buy anything made by Dash that has a non-stick coating. Someday, I may try a different brand. But right now, I’m suspicious of them all."},{"reviewerName":"chiguy312","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great little appliance","reviewDate":"April 30, 2019","reviewText":"This is my very first air fryer.

I bought this at Sam's Club last year when it was on sale for $29.99. It is a cheap way to test out air fryer. It is easy to use and compact. But unfortunately the frying plate peels terribly. After less than 2 months of usage (2-3 times a week) I notice peeling on the frying plate and the rate of peeling increases exponentially. I clean the inserts by hand and only use soft clothes. I contacted Dash customer service and they send me a new one. So this time around I started using air fryer liner. The liner helped and after some usage I did not see any wear on the frying plate. Since they are cheap on Amazon (3 packs of 150 for $6.99), I didn't mind. But unfortunately the peeling started again and just like before, once it started it gets worse very quickly. Since I use the liner, it doesn't affect the cooking but it sure is ugly to look at. I have basically given up on it and won't buy another Dash product. It is just badly made.

This is what I discovered: The basket is so small that it may not hold sufficient food for 2. A second batch has to be made The lid will not close down if the handle is in place, so I had to use tongs to place the basket in, and pull it out. The temperature only goes up to 375. I discovered that most fried goods require a higher temp. The plug is held in place magnetically-not great as it may slip. Most importantly, after using it only 4 times, it stopped working. It will not heat up.

So far I'm very happy with my purchase! I'm not a huge fan of microwaves (except for stuff like oatmeal) I just think it makes food bland and soggy. I've been wanting a convection toaster oven for a while, but they're super pricey for me at the moment. I currently have the fryer sitting on a dresser in my rented-room/office (think studio apartment)\n\nI just re-heated a Cajun chicken leg I had made two nights back for dinner, and it was honestly even better then when I first made it! The skin was super crispy but with absolutely no grease and the chicken was heated evenly to the bone after about 7 minutes in the air fryer.\n\nPros:\n\n-Lightweight\n-Super easy to clean\n-Quick and simple\n-Food tastes great\n-Perfect for a dorm room/studio apartment if they're allowed\n-Loads of options for foods you can make\n\nCons:\n\n-I am worried about the non-stick coating inside. I'm not sure how it'll last before I'll have to request a replacement. Definitely don't use any metal utensils to remove food!\n-It's not very big, don't expect to cook a chicken. Perfect for small meals and left-overs.\n-You can't cook really greasy food in it, things like: fatty bacon, sausages, burgers, ect.\n\nWhat Would I Pay:\n\nI think I'd happily pay $50 for this.

I eat veggie 'meats' so I cook my hamburgers and chicken strips in this, along with battered fish, tots, egg rolls, really anything I can possibly cook in it because it's so fast and easy. My only issue is that the grill isn't as non-stick as I'd like and takes some elbow grease to clean. At first it was good but after a year of use (but no scratches on the surface coating) the non-stick just doesn't stay non-stick. I don't know if it dries out or really what happens to it. It doesn't flake off or anything though so that's good, it just isn't 'wipe clean' anymore.

It was still fully functional and I just had to use my own timer after I turned it on. I haven't read any other people having that same issue so it could have been a fluke. Also it is a great size for one person but if I am cooking for me and my husband or meal prepping I have to do things in batches so that can get kind of tedious.

It is perhaps the best hot dog/encased meats cooker. Everything else I have tried has come out substandard to other cooking methods. It's just basically an accelerated convection oven. It will cook non-breaded chicken ok but not as well as a panini press. Anything that has a bunch of small pieces where the air can;t get between get half cooked, like fries, onion rings etc. because it has no layers. And finally, after about 10 uses the paint on the \"basket\" started coming off on the food and it started rusting. It really needs a better coating or stainless.

Everything I looked at was so huge until I found this model which is small and compact. I read all the reviews because I do put a lot of value in what others have experienced both positive and negative. It took some getting used to, but I'm having a lot of fun buying Frozen items to try out. I find it works much like a small tiny toaster oven as well, I've made salmon fillets as well as seasoned fries, jalapeno poppers, and miscellaneous small fried items. I have yet to add any oil at all even though I bought a small oil spritzer to use. It takes a little getting used to it as I said, experimenting with times and temperatures but I'm getting the hang of it. Fits perfectly in a small space I had intended in a camper.

I haven't done very much cooking since my husband started using a feeding tube a few years ago and frankly tired of prepared meals, an occasional hot dog, burger or take out. So thought I would give this a try. It is just enough for one person and have used it twice since buying it. Cooks everything perfectly and I love the browning on the outside of the meat and chicken. I rub it all down with olive oil and spices before cooking, but that's a personal choice. It's very easy to use, cleans up very easily and a very attractive appliance\n\nfor my kitchen countertop. I need to buy a cookbook specifically for air frying. My guesstimates are pretty good, but still need a book with everyday easy recipes. I would recommend it for ONE person cooking.\n\nUPDATE 12/25/18:\nTWO ISSUES...First is the handle already feels somewhat loose, Second It is very hard to see the button for the timer, without getting right on top of it.

The size I ordered is perfect for preparing french fries or other fried foods for two people. It is easy to clean too. One of the things I like most is that the outside of the fryer does not get hot to the touch during use. Two things I don't like is that the timer isn't exact in measuring the cooking time...it's sort of like a spring-operated time that you turn to indicate the length of time to cook. And since this seems to be a spring-operated time, there's no really way to turn off the timer if your food gets done earlier than expected. The way it is, you have to just let the fryer timer finish winding down until it shuts itself off.

But I got talked into it by some health-conscious friends and family members, and I'm glad I got it.\n\nI cooked two marinated chicken breasts in 15 minutes (after 3 minutes of preheating the machine), and they turned out great -- cooked to perfection inside and a healthy (not breaded) crust outside. Tender and delicious! And the machine is easy to clean -- just wash the cooking basket and grill plate in warm soapy water. They supposedly are top-shelf dishwasher safe, but I think, since they have a nonstick surface, they will last longer with handwashing. This model is big enough for two chicken breasts or a couple of servings of veggies.

It is a retro design so that may be part of it but I find it difficult to air-fry fries in a single layer in this space. I have tried (raw) sweet potatoes and half the fries came out undone so I had to pick out the fried pieces and re-fry the undone pieces (not good).\nMy second try was with baby potatoes which I halved and they all fried up nicely in 15 minutes (at 360-400). I cook for one so I have the luxury of failing but I am 50/50 on this convenience. I don't have much space in my kitchen so I'll have to try chicken wings on my third try and see if they are a game changer. I also want to add that the smell of the air-fry process is chemical-like and not appetizing like oven roasting. I've washed and rewashed the internal basket but the smell lingers.

A 25 year tradition of Friday night fish fry takeout may be at an end - that's how good a fish fry is in this. And that's from frozen breaded cod & steak fries, not from a home recipe.! Sizzling, really hot, fast, flavorful - that's how everything comes out. The size is really good for 1 or 2 people. If for 2, the size is good for one item in a varied meal but is too small for multiple items unless you don't mind keeping one person's plate warm while the other one cooks. The only thing tried so far that isn't done justice are potstickers - they come out with the dough a little tough & browned all over. They are much better with the traditional shallow steam fry method that produces a crispy brown bottom & a top dough that is a soft hot pillow encasing a moist filling. But breaded shrimp, seasoned tofu cubes, clam cakes, crunchy chickpeas, hashbrowns & fries, apple pie bites made with refrigerated biscuit dough and on and on -so good!

This air fryer does a great job of making food taste fried without oil. It's distinctly only sized for one person, or two very very small eaters. I put a boneless chicken breast in and it took up all the room. It makes GREAT chicken wings (though it can only fit 4 wing parts unless you stack them which I think would not be good). I've found that for some foods like fries and wings, lightly spraying something like peanut oil on the food gives it a little bit of a punch up on crispiness and browning. I bought an oil sprayer and put peanut oil in it and now my wings and fries come out great using only a scant bit of oil. I made a parmesan chicken breast recently and sprayed both sides with olive oil spray and it came out beautifully. I've burned several things though so be careful and watch it closely. It's very easy to clean, doesn't take up space and cooks very quickly.

So far I've cooked frozen unbreaded tilapia, breaded fish, frozen french fries, frozen tater tots, home made cream cheese wontons. I'm very impressed with how quickly it has cooked verything and how the food has turned out. Clean up is a breeze. The basket comes out and has a removable grate in the bottom. It is non stick.

I can still eat some of what I used to, it just has to be seasoned and cooked a different way. This handy thing made the BEST roasted potatoes with almost no oil in probably half the time as it usually takes to bake them, and I didn't have to turn the oven on which is a huge plus for me with my old dinosaur-stove. I also used it for onions, mushrooms, and various other vegetables which also worked well, and eggplant, which did not come out great (dry and rubbery so I just tossed in to some spaghetti sauce) but eggplant can be tricky no matter how you cook it.\n\nPerfect for 1 or 2 people or someone who doesn't have a lot of space for bulky appliances, being that it's around the same size as a food processor or blender, and it's a breeze to clean. It's plastic (doesn't get hot in the outside) but seems of decent quality.

When I bought the first, I was new to air frying and chose the model with presets for different foods. After a few uses, I stopped using the presets since I felt my food was getting overdone. This one was purchased to keep at work to reheat food (our toaster oven died and we have not replaced it). What a difference in sound levels! My old one sounded like a plane was coming in for a landing. This one is pleasantly quiet. I'm not sure if the food heats more evenly as I am using it for a smaller range of foods than I use it for at home. I am able to avoid going to the break room to clean it out every use by putting my leftovers on a small square of of parchment paper when reheating. My only issue is I keep overshooting the minutes I am trying to dial and have to roll the dial back.

I wanted to have an at-home fryer, that is compact, suitable for a household of 2. This is super easy to use, attractive in design, nice array of color choices, and best of all does justice to mimicking a fried food consistency without the crazy oil splatter cleanup and enables a healthy option for everyday consumption. It is not necessary to drizzle fat on top of food items, although that is up to the user if they want more moisture added. Great for the price bracket of any fryer and takes up very little room. If you have a larger household or you prefer healthier portions, the larger size would be ideal. This is perfect for small households of 2. Also, no digital or touch screen panel seems to reduce the likelihood of this machine going down.

Maybe have a pushbutton release or swing out basket."},{"reviewerName":"Robin Richesson","rating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"not effective at frying","reviewDate":"September 29, 2019","reviewText":"This air fryer didn't impress me at all. I only tried to make french fries, but I was so unhappy with them that I just threw them out. Not even edible. I really didn't expect the fries to be like actual deep fried french fries, but I did expect them to be similar to the oven fries I make, which take 45 minutes or so to bake. I thought this might be a quick alternative. But no. Not good. I had to keep adding time, I did shake the basket midway through as the manual said to. The potatoes were very limp with a few sort of browned spots, they tasted terrible. I think I will donate it to thrift store. Really can't spare the space in my kitchen for such a useless gadget. It wasn't hard to use or hard to clean, just didn't do a good job of \"frying\"."},{"reviewerName":"Paul Mulwitz","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"A nice new way to prepare fried food without the guilt.","reviewDate":"July 22, 2019","reviewText":"This air fryer seems to work very nicely. I have found 380 degrees F to be the ideal setting for temperature and leave it set there. It still needs a small amount of oil to properly fry food but that amount is already included in frozen foods intended for oven baking. Foods fried in this machine are still a bit higher in calories than simple baked food but I prefer the crispness achieved in this cooker. A little experimentation is needed for each food prepared this way since the instructions for most foods do not consider this new cooking method. Cooking times required for everything I have tried are several times the time needed for deep frying or pan frying in oil. Cleanup is a bit easier than frying in oil since you don't have all that used oil to dispose."},{"reviewerName":"vicki andrew","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Loving it","reviewDate":"March 29, 2019","reviewText":"I kept hearing about air-fryers but really had no interest, I had bought another counter-top kitchen item and this showed up in my recommended list and I decided at this price what the heck.

I think we put too much in so after the 2nd session w/ the fries, we emptied about 1/2 out and tried again in smaller batches that worked a bit better but they still didn't get crispy.\n\nHeating up food works great as well as finishing off wings/chicken after its been baked but Idk if I'd recommend trying to use it on french fries (unless somebody found a trick that I haven't found yet!) haha"},{"reviewerName":"Gail D","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great appliance but you must follow the directions","reviewDate":"December 22, 2018","reviewText":"First of all, I live by myself so I thought the smaller one would work just fine.

I own the Breville Smart Oven Air and have used it for air frying, but unless I'm making a lot of something it's a lot to heat up and use. As I live alone and usually only cook for 1-3 people, I discovered this little fryer was perfect. For such as fries, tater tots, chicken wings, chicken thighs and even fried eggs, it's worked perfectly. I really like the simplicity, with only a timer knob and a temp knob. I know this 'Dash' brand is something new, but I also own and enjoy their little egg cooker that I've used a lot over the last 2 years without trouble. I can put this little fryer away in a cabinet; most of them are much larger and have to sit out all the time.

It is more of a \"roaster\" than \"fryer\", but either way, it cooks beautifully. chicken, salmon, french fries, frozen chicken cordon bleu, all come out great. It has hot air blasting onto the food which gives the food a great crunch and roasted flavor. Melts the fat off of chicken legs and breast skin, to have crispy skin remaining -- a weakness -- and the meat is very moist and delicious.

Just remember, like all air fryer units it must have a good amount of room around it for air to circulate. I feel safe using it, it never gave off any funny smells or tastes to the food.

Hot oil splattering, the heavy feeling after when chips are soaked in the oil. It takes some getting used to and you need to check it while you're air frying.

I use to own a deep fryer and hated when all of the oil would get on the surrounding walls in my kitchen and I also hated having to clean out the old oil.

It changed the tots taste to extra crispy without the extra fat or heating my whole home with my oven.\n2. It's very non-stick but not super slippery\n3. Very small space saver.\n4. Cooks thinks faster, so when I get home late I don't have to wait for my food to be done, just load it , do my things and come back 15 to 20 minutes later and my food is ready. I would buy this again if anything happens to my current one."},{"reviewerName":"Elliot","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Perfect!","reviewDate":"November 15, 2018","reviewText":"So easy to cook with, easy to clean, and easy to control. I like that it doesn’t have a digital screen (one thing can can’t get damaged by heat!), and features clean knobs instead. I love to toss gyoza in it, or tofu to make it firm and crispy. Lately I have even been putting barbecue jackfruit in there after it is fully prepared, to make the edges crispy (like actual bbq!).

I also have their mini waffle maker and the egg cooker. I saw other reviewers complaining this was too small... well it says COMPACT in the description. This is perfect for cooking for one or two people and I found the fryer basket to be plenty roomy. The manual comes with some good recipes and I will be trying their sweet potato fries tonight! If you want an air fryer where you can load up enough food for 4-5 people at once, this is not the fryer for you. Again, if you're like myself and just cooking for one or two.

Next up is sweet potato fries, so I'm hoping they come out well. This is a smaller unit, so not suitable for family meals, but nice for a single person, or snacks.

I like that the tray to put food in is metal, not high temp plastic or something...\n\nCooking Time:\nThis cooks things a lot faster than in my oven and doesn't take 20 minutes to preheat. The oven is around 4500 watts and this is around 1000, so this should take a lot less energy.\n\nThe Smell:\nYou get a moderately strong smell from this when it is cooking when it is new. At first I thought it was plastic, but now I think it is the coating they put on the cooking pan.\n\nControls:\nIt is missing and off and on button, and the ability to change the timer to zero after your cooking is done. Sometimes things cook a little faster.\n\nComplaint:\nThe controls and the initial smell would be my only two complaints at this time. So if your food is done before the timer you set, you need to leave the food tray partially out to keep the device from turning back on. A power switch would be nice. Also the ability to turn the timer counter clockwise would be nice, and would suffice to turn the device off.\n\nThe taste of the food:\nThe food tastes the same as when I back it in the oven. I have these chicken nuggets I get for when we are out of food, and I normally microwave them, which doesn't make them have any flavor. Backing them in this device does't take long, and they taste much more flavorful than from the microwave.\n\nI like it. It was a good gift!"},{"reviewerName":"Abby R.","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"So tiny","reviewDate":"August 29, 2019","reviewText":"This worked fine but it is tiny.

HUGE FIRE RISK!!!!!!!!!!! HORRIBLY MADE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","reviewDate":"June 5, 2018","reviewText":"UPDATE: After less than a few months using this, it has completely stopped working! At week 4 the fan started to sound horrible, like someone with a can of marbles, and eventually died completely. The heating coil has NEVER ONCE provided the temperature listed on the knob. Then, toward the end of its life (again, less than 6 months into usage), it CAUGHT FIRE. THIS IS A HUGE FIRE RISK This is by far one of the worst made, worst designed pieces of complete garbage I've ever wasted my money on. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nSAVE YOUR OWN LIVES AND THOSE THAT LIVE NEAR YOU. DO NOT BUY THIS EVER. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. IF YOU HAVE ONE, RETURN IT OR THROW IT AWAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!THIS ITEM IS DANGEROUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nTemps aren't very accurate and there absoultely NEEDS to be a fan speed controller. It constantly blasts at 100% which is not always the best choice.\n\nYou can add your own controller, but the body is a bit annoying to disassemble. Once disassembled I added an adjustable fan speed controller and removed the horrible bell. The next modification I will make is removing the manual timer, replacing it with a microcontroller that can support both temperature accurately and set the timer for longer than 30 minutes (the max on the manual timer).\n\nThe area where you press your thumb against the main body to remove the tray wears very very quickly.

Highly recommended for frozen food","reviewDate":"July 18, 2018","reviewText":"COOKING REVIEW:\nToday, this Dash unit became my introduction to air frying and I'm super impressed with the results. So far, I've only done some frozen popcorn shrimp and fries, and for those two foods at least, I know I'll never go back to using an oven or deep fryer. In my oven, these things usually came out as some weird hybrid of soggy and burnt. With my deep fryer, I got better texture than the oven, but the extra calories usually aren't worth it to me. This Dash air fryer, on the other hand, gives me everything I'm looking for. If I hadn't made them myself, you definitely could've fooled me into believing the food came out of a deep fryer. Of course the real test for this air fryer will be when I decide to make \"fried\" food from scratch; but for frozen junk, I couldn't recommend it more highly.\n\nUpdate: I made some potatoes and \"fried\" chicken thighs from scratch (pictured), and I'm still impressed.\n\nSIZE REVIEW:\nI'm running low on counter space, so I wanted a unit with a small footprint or that was at least light/compact enough to tuck away in a cabinet. This Dash fryer gives me both. It's about 13 inches tall, which seems pretty standard for an air fryer. But its footprint is only a little larger than a gallon of milk. It's also very light, which is appreciated when taking it out of the cabinet.\n\nThe Dash's basket is 6.5 inches wide. Without stacking, I was able to fit 2 chicken thighs at a time. For larger pieces of meat, you'll probably be limited to cooking them one at a time, which might get annoying. But for stackable foods like chicken nuggets, fries, veggies, etc, the Dash should easily be able to fit a two-person batch. As a single person, this size works for me."},{"reviewerName":"Shorty","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Convenient Machine","reviewDate":"October 3, 2019","reviewText":"I bought my air fryer in late August. I've used it several times since purchasing it, and love it. I've cooked brussel sprouts, potato wedges, fries, chicken thighs and drumsticks, and chicken wings so far. I live in the Gulf Coast, which of course means it's hot as hell and turning on the oven, even with a.c. running is a not my favorite. I like the convenience of being able to cook in this fryer a variety of foods without having to turn on my oven, making my house hotter. Also, I like how fast it seems to cook foods because of the heat circulating around the food in a smaller space than a traditional oven. I would, and have, recommended this product to friends and family."},{"reviewerName":"Jessica W.","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Game changer, especially for parents!","reviewDate":"April 15, 2019","reviewText":"If you have a kid who is a chicken nugget and fries nut like mine, this is a game changer! Saves heating the stove for 30+ min to 400 degrees to cook for 10 min. I tried this out as soon as I got home (love my kitchen gadgets). Pretty intuitive use, no preheating required, and no additional grease. You can add seasoning before cooking. I put about 4oz of oreida extra crispy fast food fries in for 10min @400 and that was a bit much so this is def a hot box. If there was more product or a combo of fries and nugs, I think 10 min would be sufficient. Clean up was a breeze, and it cools down pretty quickly. Tho I didn’t actually touch the machine while running, I can feel heat from it by hovering my hand about an inch away from it, so beware to give it space while using.\nVery happy with my impulse buy! Will update if it explodes LOL! 😆"},{"reviewerName":"Mayhem","rating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"It's Cooking Volume is Small","reviewDate":"December 28, 2018","reviewText":"I received one as a Christmas gift from my daughter. I wanted it to work for me. I quickly realized I did not like it and had her return it.\n1. The temperature control dial could not be set to 400 F. -- the dial would not turn that far.\n2. The fryer's power cord is not long.\n3. It is easy to clean, as long as one is careful not to lose the rubber \"feet\" on the basket/strainer -- one came off during washing and nearly got washed down the sink drain.\n4. I find it easier to just to make my food in a conventional oven. It is less work. An example -- I can make sweet potato fries from two sweet potatoes in one batch in the oven. In the air fryer, I had to make MANY, MANY batches since they could only be in a single layer in the tiny basket per the included recipe book instructions. Plus they needed to be shaken half way thru frying. So every 5 minutes I had to do something: add fries, shake, remove fries, add fries, shake.... In the conventional oven, they get flipped once. I can focus on other kitchen tasks using the conventional oven.\n5. The fryer basket was too small to make soda bread unless I made mini-loafs, but then I'd have to buy a small baking dish that would fit inside the fryer.\n6.

I usually get my frozen stir fry veggie mix or fresh veggies or even tofu and add seasoning. Standing in front of the skillet stir frying these takes time. Switch to air frying them and it's so easy. No hassle and it's easy to clean up.\nRequires some experimentation for the correct time and temperature setting and I usually put it for half the interval and stir/flip them and set a timer for the next half.\n\nNote : this is appropriate when cooking for one.
