I don't like the mess. It takes too much time. My recipes never turn out like they show in the cookbooks...and my cooking is pretty awful. I got the Cosori Air Fryer a couple of weeks ago, and I've been happily cooking every day, multiple times a day since.\n\nYou just pull it out of the box, and it's ready to go. The detachable basket and pan are all that needed cleaning in soapy water before adding food. The buttons are self-explanatory. You've got a snowflake for frozen foods, fries for fries, bacon for bacon, and also Preheat and Keep Warm.\n\nWhen I first turned it on, I wasn't sure what to expect. I wondered if it was going to get hot and scorch my counter (or me). I thought it would be noisy. It was none of those things. It does get a little warm on the outside but not hot like an oven. You do need to be careful when you're pulling the basket out or any food from inside the fryer because it's deceiving that it works so quickly and gets food that hot that fast. As for noise, you can hear the air moving, but I wouldn't call it noisy. My Alexa is near the air fryer, and the Alexa hears me just fine when I'm talking while the air fryer is running. Also, since my Alexa is near the air fryer, you can tell that the air fryer doesn't get too hot or spit things at you or I wouldn't have the Alexa there.\n\nThe air fryer looks great on my counter too. It's already become a conversation piece in my kitchen. I had family over this weekend, and they wanted to know what it was. I put on a kitchen demo of sorts, and everyone stood around and watched, then ate all of the food (not a crumb left on the plates!), and then they said they needed to get an air fryer too.\n\nSo far, I've tried recipes in the included recipe book as well as a recipe for chicken fried steak in an air fryer cookbook I purchased separately. What's great about the cookbook included in the Cosori air fryer is that each recipe has a picture with it, and the ingredients aren't intimidating to those of you like me who don't care for cooking. Most recipes call for ingredients you've actually heard of and probably have in your pantry -- a real plus for me because I also hate wandering around in a grocery store searching for a random ingredient I'll only use once.\n\nThe very first recipe I tried was sweet potato fries in the included Cosori cookbook. I like my fries a little crunchy, so I probably could have left them in the air fryer a few minutes longer than the recipe called for, but they were still delicious. Definitely the best sweet potato fries I've ever had.\n\nFor fun, I then threw in some frozen okra I had bought in the freezer section. I bought a water bottle and filled it with olive oil, so all I did was lightly squirt the olive oil on the okra while in the air fryer basket and then just pushed the snowflake button. The okra came out so crunchy, just the way I like it. And I couldn't believe it had gone from frozen to crispy crunchy in just a matter of minutes. Most of them were golden brown, but I could tell the ones that I had missed when I sprayed the okra with the olive oil. Those were white -- still crunchy and tasted fine, but a weird-looking white. I've since bought a pressurized oil sprayer can that's specifically for spraying olive oil, and it works much better at spraying everything evenly than my plastic water bottle.\n\nSame night and onto my third recipe: chicken fried steak. Now, this recipe wasn't in the incuded Cosori cookbook. This particular cookbook didn't have a picture, so I wasn't at all sure how it would turn out. It's so good, I've cooked it twice in three nights.\n\nThat night's entire meal was cooked in the air fryer: sweet potato fries, frozen-turned-air fried okra, and chicken fried steak. It felt like an elaborate meal with hardly any time invested, and my kitchen wasn't a disaster after cooking all of that. I only had a few plates and a couple of bowls that I'd used instead of pots and pans and baking dishes all piled up on my counter with a greasy stove to clean.\n\nThe next day, I tried the mozzarella cheese sticks in the included Cosori cookbook. I totally botched this recipe, using baking soda instead of cornstarch. Did I mention how bad I am at cooking? Even so, the mozzarella sticks worked out okay (but not great, which was likely my own fault). They crisped up nicely and quickly. They just didn't look a thing like the picture in the recipe book. I would have also liked the cheese to be more melted on the inside. It seemed like the outside was really crispy and the inside wasn't really melted. This could all be because of my using the wrong ingredient, so I'll give it another shot because, even with the wrong ingredient, they weren't bad. They didn't taste like mozzarella cheese sticks, but they were still good.\n\nFor dinner, I cooked the kids grilled cheese sandwiches also using the included cookbook. These didn't turn out as expected. At least I used the right ingredients this time. But the cheese wasn't gooey like it would be if you cooked it on the stove. If I had doubled the amount of cheese the recipe called for it would probably be perfect. The bread was golden brown, though. It was a bit of a pain to have to melt butter on the stove, then brush it onto the bread, then grate cheese before putting it into the air fryer. I can get a grilled cheese sandwich in a pan quicker than that, but it was still fun to try. I'll try the recipe again with more cheese. I think it's a recipe I can tinker with to make perfect.\n\nI then tried the pizza from the Cosori recipe book. I didn't use pizza dough. I prefer pita bread. I followed the instructions as if it was pizza dough, which means you preheat the air fryer, brush your crust with olive oil, and then put it in the air fryer at 320 for five minutes. Then you take it out to add toppings. On mine, I put pizza sauce, pepperoni, mozzarella, and parmesan. Pop it back into the air fryer for another five minutes at 320, and it's done. It was so good. I'll be making another for lunch. The only downside was having to cook one at a time because I couldn't fit two pieces of pita bread in the basket together.\n\nMy most-recent recipe to try is the coconut shrimp, which is also in the cookbook that comes with the air fryer. What would normally be a giant mess of the kitchen was only three bowls to dredge the coconut shrimp and then a plate to put them on. You preheat the air fryer while you're getting everything ready, and then pop the shrimp in for eight minutes. They were very tasty, but I'll add more coconut in my dredge next time than the recipe calls for. The recipe was good, but I couldn't really taste the coconut.\n\nI keep picking out new recipes to try in the cookbook, which is a first for me with my loathe of cooking. I've included pictures of the country fried steak, pizza, grilled cheese, mozzarella sticks, and coconut shrimp that I've made so far.\n\nEven owning the 5.8 quart, you have to get used to cooking in batches. I wanted to make four chicken fried steaks that first night, but there was only room for two. Not a big deal. You just have to cook in batches. Making three pita bread pizzas, I just had to make each one separately since I could only fit one round piece of pita in at a time. For the grilled cheese sandwiches, two actually fit into the air fryer at the same time.\n\nLike I said before, the cookbook that comes with the air fryer is full of pictures. It also has more than 100 pages of recipes. For example, you'll find recipes for strawberry cream scones, stuffed french toast, BBQ bacon, ribeye, meatballs, fried chicken, crab cakes, wings, pigs in a blanket, french fries, onion rings, roasted corn, cheddar buttermilk biscuits, cinnamon rolls, pound cake, and orange cranberry muffins. I would be lost without the cookbook. It also tells you exactly which button to push on the air fryer too, so you're learning about how to use your air fryer while you're actually cooking instead of having to read an instruction manual cover to cover before you even have enough confidence to cook something.\n\nI mentioned not having many dishes to clean after using the air fryer. What I love most about cleanup is how easy the air fryer itself is to clean. Everything just slides off of it. I'm barely scrubbing it, and it's clean. I know the description says it's dishwasher safe, but I just wash it in the sink because there's nothing ever dried on and stuck to it. I love how I can put a little soap on it, and it's clean and ready for my next recipe. The water beads on it, so it dries really fast.\n\nThe only negative about the air fryer is probably my own impatience with one of the controls. The temp/time is shared by one button. If you have a recipe that calls for you to adjust the temp and/or time, you have to toggle the button. It starts with temp, so if you need to change how long to keep something in, you hit the temp/time button again. Somehow, I keep managing to hit time when I mean temp and vice versa.\n\nAlso, the air fryer cuts off when you pull the basket out, just as it should so it's not running while there's nothing in the bottom. When you pop the basket back in, it defaults back to the original temp and time settings when you turn it on, not what you last had on there. It would be nice if it remembered what your setting was 5 minutes before. For example, the other night when I had to make the pizzas in batches, I had to run the air fryer 5 minutes for one crust, then five minutes for the next, and so on. Every time, I had to reset the time and temp when I pulled a crust out. That's when I began noticing how bad I was at toggling the temp/time button I mentioned above.\n\nBoth the time/temp button being shared and the air fryer not remembering your last time/temp are extremely minor downsides. But they're the only negatives I could think of because this air fryer has quickly become my favorite kitchen appliance.\n\nI have never had any experience with an air fryer, so I have nothing to compare the Cosori air fryer against. But I did my research. read the reviews, watched videos, and crossed my fingers that I was buying the right one. I couldn't have made a better choice. I'm actually excited to cook for the first time ever. Tomorrow on the breakfast menu: french toast sticks!"},{"reviewerName":"Dan","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great Appliance","reviewDate":"November 6, 2018","reviewText":"My Wife and I purchased the Air Fryer and received it Sunday. So far we have only used it twice, but so far it is great! We cooked Crab Cakes last night with some tater tots and biscuits this morning for breakfast. Really easy to use and easy to clean. So far we both love it.\n\nUpdate\nWe have had it a few weeks now and continue to enjoy it. We did buy some accessories that work, but I wish that there were some designed specifically for the 5.8 QT Air fryer. These were made for both which means they are really too small to take advantage of the 5.8 QT volume. They only \"kind of\" work.\n\nWe still love the fryer. That is why I did not change the star rating.

I need a large basket for walleye and this is the largest I could find (10x10), which was a selling point. However, there are so many benefits! The programmed options, the ease of cleaning, the safety button on the basket, the price, just to name a few. I've only had it a few days and I've already made a home for it on my counter and replaced my smaller, less versatile Phillip's air fryer with this dynamo. I'll keep the other one for things like fries or potatoes, while using this one for the main items. I haven't looked at the recipe book but I'm going to do so soon.

It is easy to clean in the dishwasher, and the preset settings mean that I don't have to calculate time or temperature. But it's also easy to add time or subtract it if you need to. The night I received my air fryer, I made the most amazing steaks that were so tender and moist inside! Since then, I have made Cornish hens, BBQ ribs, blueberry muffins, tater tots, and many other dishes. The fryer is not heavy and it is not loud when in use.

She has tried a lot of ones on here but she always found fault with either them being too small or not powerful enough. She noticed many of them had baskets that the non stick flaked off just after a few uses so she has informed me that this one has a great coating. I think it may be ceramic but anyway she says it is a breeze to clean.\nShe thought it was making weird noises so she contacted Customer Support and within a few hours she had a response. They asked her to video tape the unit in operation and once reviewing the video they got right back to her and said it was normal so we know they stand behind their products.\nMy wife uses it every day making bacon, sausage and home fries for breakfast and many scrumptious meals.\nWe get the frozen battered haddock fillets so on Fridays we make our fish fry and it cooks in half the time of the oven.\nShe made bacon wrapped pork tenderloin and bacon wrapped fillet mignon and they came out crispy on the outside and juicy inside.\nI have posted a picture of our last nights dinner. She put a dry rub on the wings and cooked with fries and they too came out crispy and juicy and the fries were nice and crunchy but fluffy inside.\nI am so glad she kept trying fryers til she got the one that is the best available.\nI really do recommend purchasing this air fryer.

The brand name was unfamiliar to me, but I bought it on the strength of customer reviews, which never seem to steer me wrong. I am SO impressed with this air fryer, and I will definitely recommend it to friends and family. I've had it for about a month, and because of the ease of cooking and cleanup, I've used it at least once a day and more. I am calorie and fat content conscious, so I use an oil spritzer to lightly coat my foods. I spray the basket with cooking spray when that is a recipe detail. I've seen so many people say that something in cooking spray makes the nonstick coating on their air fryer baskets just peel right off. I have used cooking spray countless times in my Cosori, and the coating has held up fine.\n\nI've seen some reviewers complain about the noise and the beeping. I am, like, say what? I was worried about the noise, but I've got to say that the complainers may have sensitive ears. I like to know when my Cosori is finishing a cycle. Then I can be right there to throw in more food if I'm doing two batches or a full meal. I don't find the beeping sound or the fan sound of the machine to be offensive AT ALL.\n\nThis machine cooks like a dream, I love it, and now wonder how I lived without it. I love the French fries made in the Cosori. I spritz them with EVOO, salt them, and sprinkle them with Messana dried parmesan, which is incredibly flavorful and very low calorie. Stir them in the bowl to coat them, pop them into the Cosori, and diners are moaning with delight in 15 minutes. Delicious and guilt free!\n\nBuy this machine. Easy to clean. No mess in the kitchen. Creates fabulous dishes. Last night I was dining alone, and in six minutes I had the most delicious salmon I've ever tasted along with parmesan French fries. My kitchen was as clean as when I started. I can choose to wash the pan and basket by hand or throw them in my dishwasher. It's toss up which I choose to do. I only know my time, which is valuable, has been cut way back in my kitchen without sacrificing meal quality. In fact, we are eating better and healthier! I haven't enjoyed having French fries in a very long time. Now I can enjoy them every day if I wish. You should soak a freshly cut up batch of potato slices for 20 minutes, so when I peel potatoes and cut them up, I do several days' worth and put any I don't use in a container filled with water. That way they are ready to blot dry and fry whenever we want fries. They stay nice in a raw state in water for days on end. Don't hesitate like I did. Buy this wonderful baby."},{"reviewerName":"mark artzer","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Just a small convection oven","reviewDate":"February 3, 2019","reviewText":"Not too pleased with the results"},{"reviewerName":"Kristen L.

Initially the unit worked as described. After about a month, the unit started to shut down intermittently. I thought it was because it was getting hot. I was confused as to why it would perform this way. I plugged it into different outlets to see if that would resolve the issue. This did not. Finally, it died. It was used less than a dozen times during a three month period.\n\nI called Amazon to initiate a return. The rep issued a return label less the cost of shipping, which reduced the refund by about $26. I asked why as the unit was clearly defective. The rep said that it was because it was after the 30-day return window. I said that the defect did not manifest until after a month, and that there was no way to know that it would be defective before then. I asked to speak with a manager, who basically repeated the same policy. The manager did offer to give me the contact information of the manufacturer. She made clear that they would not issue a refund, but would likely reissue another unit. I had lost confidence in the unit given how quickly it puttered out. The manager stated that the refund less the shipping was all that could be done.\n\nLeft with two options, a) refund less shipping or b) risk another defective unit and another return scenario, I opted for the first option. I was, nevertheless, deeply disappointed and frustrated that Amazon came short on rectifying the situation. To be clear, I do not blame the rep or the manager. They were friendly and professional. They seemed limited to the policy.\n\nThe policy is at issue. This is an electronic unit with electronic complexities. Customers of such units would be better served with longer return windows than 30 days, or whatever the scientific average is for electronic units to manifest defects.\n\nAmazon, if you are reading this, please consider variable return windows given unit complexities/categories. Perhaps, algorithms can figure out reasonable expectations."},{"reviewerName":"Wes","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great for Steak!","reviewDate":"January 28, 2019","reviewText":"I'll admit that the only reason I bought this, is because several people told me that air fryers make great steaks.\nI love a good steak, and have never been satisfied with any that I've made indoors.\n\nEvery recipe I've seen says to cook steak at 400, but I usually cook very thick, 1Lb Ribeyes, and that seems to dry it a bit too much on the outside, while leaving the middle undone, so I reduced the temperature to 380 and slightly increased the cook time, and it came out perfect!\nOf course, the thickness of your steak is going to make a difference, so experiment a little!\n\nI simply marinated in McCormick's Garlic, Herb & Wine marinade and had the best homemade ribeye I've ever eaten.\n\nI have only had the thing a week so far, but have made steak 3 times, taquitos, frozen corn dog mini's, and frozen pre-breaded okra.\nThe okra didn't turn out so good, so I'll need to experiment a bit more with that, but everything else was great.\nI read that spritzing a little oil on the okra first will have it coming out just perfect.\nI love that the flavor is sealed, foods are perfectly cooked on the outside and crisp when they are supposed to be crisp (like the corn dogs and taquitos), but not dried out on the inside.\n\nIt is my first air fryer, but I believe I made the right choice going with the Cosori.\nIt is super easy to use and super easy to clean.\nI wouldn't hesitate to buy this brand again!"},{"reviewerName":"Dennis Garcia Alcordo","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Very good appliance and excellent customer service!

My only concern is that there is a rattling noise that gets progressively louder and then abruptly stops (sounds like a loose part of some sort). I did line the outer basket with aluminum foil but I don't think that caused the noise. Overall, I can see myself using this for many years to come. The chops came out juicy and crispy as if I had deep fried them, with the satisfaction of knowing that it's healthier to some extent. For those that bought this, is the noise in my video normal or do I have a defective unit? I don't really mind the noise I'm just scared that it will break down in the future or heavens forbid catch fire. 5 stars if it weren't for the noise.\n\nUpdate 2/1/2019:\nArovast reached out to me via personal message and asked me to send a video of the appliance directly to them for analysis.

It would turn on and off during the cooking process repeatedly anytime I set the temperature above 360 degrees for very long. It eventually shut itself down completely and would not power up after I tried 400 degrees for cooking. I thought it was dead and was going to throw it out in anger. A few days later I tried it again, and it powered up fine. I tried to preheat to 400 degrees and it made it about 4 minutes or so before it began cycling on and off. I backed the temperature back down to 350 and it works fine for any length of time at that temperature. Maybe I can push it to 360 degrees, but I know 380-400 degrees causes problems. The thermostat seems to be shutting the unit down due to overheating of the inside of the unit. I have noticed this air fryer seems to cook a little hot for the displayed temperature. French fries start to burn at the end of cooking the allotted time when the readout says I'm at 360-380. Maybe the display and actual temperature are not calibrated correctly. Maybe this is only my unit, or maybe its more prevalent in other units, I don't know. In any event ,it's pretty functional and is a of good size.

After looking at several I decided on the Cosori 5.8 qt. Everything I have tried in the Cosori, frozen french fries, onion rings, breaded okra, beer battered fish, chicken nuggets, fresh salmon, tater tots, and pepper poppers, have turned out crispy and delicious. I find it very easy to use. It has several presets as well as manual controls. I like the shake reminder when using the frozen preset and that it turns off when you pull out to shake and back on when you return the basket. The square basket allows everything to fit inside nicely and clean up is a breeze. The size of this fryer is too large to leave out on my kitchen counter but it is easy to lift in and out of my pantry when needed. I was impressed that they offered a two year warranty, tells me they stand behind what they are selling and I am hoping if I ever have a problem their \"Need Help? Talk To Us! statement on the very nice recipe booklet I received with customer service information will prove to be as helpful as the statement sounds.

Chicken fries, stromboli and french fries came out much better than just oven baking. It preheats faster than the toaster oven and cooks in less time.\n\nOne quirk we don't like that it doesn't remember last temperature / time used. Also, when shaking, sometimes it forgets the current settings causing you to have to input them again.\n\nThe larger model is very tall. We had problems storing it in the island cabinets. Had to make room under the kitchen sink for storage.\n\nBeware that the max warranty for this item is two years. We thought that you received a two year warranty, and then by registering on their site we would receive another year. That is not the case. You get one year warranty at purchase and another year if you register on their site. I confirmed this by contacting warranty support.\n\nIn conclusion, we really like the air fryer!

Time will tell if it is reliable.","reviewDate":"The manufacturer commented on the review below","reviewText":"This is my third brand of air fryer. I had a Habor that malfunctioned after 2 months. Bought a 400 dollar Breville Smart oven that malfunctioned on day one. i had it....but I wanted an air fryer because I didn't want to fire up the oven every time I wanted to oven fry 4 pieces of chicken. I caved and got the Cosori.\n\nPROS: Large capacity (5.8 qt) Small profile compared to others. Non stick seems more durable than others (my habor started chipping after a few uses and hand washing). After having made fried chicken in other air fryers, THIS one reigns supreme. It achieves something that other air fryers couldn't do. Normally, 'crispy' fried chicken in an air fryer just describes the skin being rendered to a point where its like a shell on the chicken. Sure, its crunchy, but it lacks the texture of fried chicken. The cosori somehow manages to get those little 'bubbles' in the skin like real fried chicken. It has more of the texture of real fried chicken.\nCONS: How long will it last? My past experience with other brands doesn't give me confidence. Sure, Cosori gives you a 2 year warranty...but I would rather have something that lasts than something you need to trade in every now and then...keeping in mind that once the 2 years is up...no more trade ins.\nOnly time will tell.\n\nIf you want to slide the basket out to flip food, its probably best to pull it completely out, otherwise the electronic control panel gets a blast of hot steam, which can't be good. Maybe the panel is protected from this? I'm not going to chance it. If it's not protected from hot steam, its a design flaw."},{"reviewerName":"SchwebelJ","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"We didn't even know we would love this, but we do","reviewDate":"May 1, 2019","reviewText":"I added this product onto our wedding registry because I was running out of items we needed.

We love the larger 5.8 quart size and is non-stick and cleans *super* easily which is great for someone like me who hates to wash dishes.\n\nA few tips to convince anyone on the fence about getting an air fryer:\n- Costco pre-cooked bacon tastes AMAZING in this.\n- Leftover pizza tastes even better than fresh pizza in 5 minutes, no preheat needed.\n- Tons of Trader Joe's frozen foods cook perfectly and really easily in this like their cauliflower gnocchi, chicken tenders, corn, and turning fresh asparagus and butternut squash zigzags into alternative fries.\n- Leftover veggies reheat well in this with a nice char which makes it better than the fresh dish\n\nOur so-called \"instant\" pot is never coming up from under the counter again while this Cosori air fryer is the only table-top appliance we don't store away between uses because we use it so often."},{"reviewerName":"Marian","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Super powerful, and VERY easy to use!","reviewDate":"January 17, 2019","reviewText":"Works amazingly well!

The cooking area where your food is is metal.\n\nCons:\n- Big and high so it does not fit in my pan cabinet\n- French fry preset was way too long. Need about 12 minute instead, total.\n\nTips:\n- Adjust the time to less than what is recommended or else they may be dry and overcooked\n- Spray the vegetables with olive oil and I use tongs to \"toss\" them around at the mid-point alarm\n\nI was worried about buying this brand since I had never heard of it before.

The chicken came out the same, aside from the fact I had to make it in 2 batches, due to space, as oppossed to one batch.\nMaybe it's because I already make my food in my large convection oven. The results are the same. Crispy on the outside; moist and tender in the middle. Little to no oil.\nAs for french fries. I won't even try them. Fries you find in the freezer isle of your local grocer are unhealthy to begin with. Read the ingredients. Some of them require a degree in chemistry to understand what's in them. Plus, they are already laced with oil and sodium. Making them in the air fryer does not change their ingredients, or, in my opinion, make them healthier for you as opposed to making them in my convection oven. I now opt for fresh russets, toss with oil, and roasted on parchment paper in my oven.\nSo, I guess it is just a matter of opinion. As for me, there is no such thing as \"air frying\". Trying to cut sodiuim, fat, and carbs, I'll continue with my tried and true tested methods used in my convection oven. Low oil, low to no sodium, roasted on parchment paper.

The fact that this one has a Pre-Heat setting is what tipped the scales for me. That helps with the crisping of foods.\n\nWe are a family of 5 and I got the 5.8qt. size fryer. It holds plenty, yet it has a low profile and fits under my kitchen cabinet.\n\nFor those of you, like me, who were confused on what this appliance actually is; it’s really a counter-top convection oven. Not a “fryer”. It circulates hot air around your food. The result is nicely cooked veggies, seafood, etc. in a short amount of time. The veggies turn out great... similar to roasting but it takes a lot less time. Just toss your what you’re cooking lightly in olive oil and the machine does the rest.\n\nIt’s also very easy to clean. The only thing I would improve is the release button on the basket... it’s a little tricky at first to get the hang of... but after a few surprise drops, I’m now trained to make sure it’s resting a counter before releasing the basket. We’re having fun with it so far.\n\nThis would be a good appliance for very small apartments, motor homes, or boats because it can actually function as your main oven."},{"reviewerName":"Amy F","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Lower quality than I expected after seeing the reviews.","reviewDate":"February 5, 2019","reviewText":"When I opened this air fryer, the non stick coating was already coming off.

Honestly, about the best I've ever had. It is easy to use, easy to clean, and has earned a permanent spot on our kitchen counter. It re-heats food like it was made fresh (think pizza etc.), doesn't require an oven preheat, no oil.\n\nNow, the customer support part. We ordered this online and used it first for some fried chicken. it was delicious, but it behaved a little strangely - would suddenly cut out for a few seconds, and then come back on. I thought that's weird, but maybe that's what it's supposed to do? Anyway, it got worse and eventually stopped working after the 4th or 5th use. By this time it was too late to return to Amazon so I contacted customer support via their website chat.\n\nWithin about 10 minutes we had a new one on the way, no charge, no return required, and 4 days later we received the properly functioning we have now. I wanted to wait until we got the new one to check out before I reviewed.\n\nTHAT's how customer service is supposed to work when things go wrong. You back up your product when something's not right. So kudos to Cosori for a really great kitchen appliance, and triple kudos for their customer support.\n\nI would not hesitate to buy another anything from Cosori."},{"reviewerName":"me123","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Decent sized air fryer","reviewDate":"The manufacturer commented on the review below","reviewText":"This is a pretty good air fryer. I knocked a star off because I think its a bit expensive for a brand I've never heard of. Otherwise, I've cooked pork, fish, brussel sprouts, fries, all sorts of things in it and it works well. Size-wise, I can easily fit two mackerels in it - three very crowded. Food turns out well. I was afraid it would be another kitchen gadget I would buy, use a few times, and end up cluttering the countertop, but I have used it at least once a week, for the past few months. Cooking fish (especially mackerel) can be stinky, but I just put this gadget right over the stovetop, turn on the stovetop ventilation, and it is the easiest, cleanest, least-stinky way of cooking fish."},{"reviewerName":"Tom A.

F for 5 minutes to eliminate any possible manufacturing/electrical residue. There was somewhat of an electrical smell with this process, but that has been normal with other kitchen electrics I own. (Some manuals will even direct you to run the appliance a few minutes to let it \"cure in\" and to expect an electrical odor.) The odor dissipates and isn't an ongoing issue after curing.\n\nStarted off with cooking tests of 3 inexpensive items: meat, potatoes and bread. I didn't use fresh items for the testing, but chose frozen sausage patties, frozen \"cubed\" hash browns, and canned biscuits. I made certain to preheat the fryer for every item at the cooking temperature being used - the results were impressive.\n\nFor the sausage patties, the fryer was preheated at 390 deg. F for 5 minutes then cooked at 390 deg. F. Cook time was 6 minutes and patties were flipped over at 3 minutes. The finished patties were tender and moist, just slightly browned around the edges, but not at all burnt or hard. Wonderful result. (Quite a bit of time saved over skillet cooked patties which I usually cook low and slow to keep them tender and avoid hardness/burning.)\n\nThe fryer was cooled and preheated again at 390 deg. F. The frozen cubed potatoes were lightly spritzed with EVOO, and cooked at 390 deg. F for 7 minutes. With 3 minutes remaining, the potatoes were tossed well, seasoned with salt and pepper and lightly spritzed again. (The potatoes weren't seasoned initially because I wanted to clearly see how well the fryer was browning them.) The end result was light brown crusty edges and tender centers. Perfect. Better than oven roasted.\n\nSaving the canned biscuits for last, I really thought this would be the challenge and was prepared for a re-do. (I haven't been very successful in the past with canned biscuits in the GoWise Turbo air fryer.) I set the fryer to preheat at 360 deg. F for 4 minutes and used the time to lightly butter both sides of the 5 biscuits.\n\nThe biscuits cooked almost 5 minutes on 360 deg. F. At 3 minutes remaining, I pulled the basket out and checked them with the intent of flipping them over. But I decided to wait and see what the end result if they weren't flipped. I was very surprised to see the end result were biscuits that looked as if they had been cooked in a conventional oven. I literally could see no difference. They rose perfectly, browned without burning and even had a light brown crust on bottom. So there would have been no need to flip them at all - another time saver and great looking biscuits! Let me tell you I was happy !\n\nKeep in mind these tests weren't even run with fresh foods...so I can imagine how great fresh chicken, wings, ribs, steak, fresh seasonal vegetables and homemade breads will be! There may be occasional tweeks with with temps and time, but from what I have seen thus far, this fryer will produce very good results if proper temp, time and techniques are used. (And barring any unforeseen errors and issues with the unit of course.)\n\nAlmost forgot to mention the KEEP WARM feature is going to be a real help to me since hubby's work hours aren't stable! (Then there's that gorgeous cookbook that came with the fryer I need to cook through!) Registered right away to capture the extra year warranty.\n\nP.S. - I also have the Cosori Multicooker which is a stellar performer. It has Bake, Boil, Roast, Steam, Slow Cook (3 levels - Low/Med/High) , Saute, Simmer, Brown, Yogurt, Rice functions and also Manual programmable temperature and time input.

Having said that, I have ceramic tile floors and I dropped it 20 or more times (anyone who has that type of floor knows it is rare for anything to survive such a fall, but the XL hanged on). Over time the XL became so banged up that I decided once I move I would re-purchase it. However, after moving, Amazon was having a sale and my pocketbook was tugging at me to make a change. \"I could always return it if I hated it and buy the XL again,\" I said to myself. Well.......... I LOVE THE COSORI MORE!!!!!!! It has a square basket which fits items much better than the oval one, it's quieter, it's still a spaceship in size but it is very nice looking with the matte textured black plastic, it's truly awesome and is my addiction for life. I use it to warm up food, toast bread, make pizzas, cookies, fries, onion rings, etc., you name it. You can do almost anything with this gorgeous machine and it is super FAST (which saves you on electricity and cooking heat in your house). If you are questioning some brands, I strongly encourage you to just buy the Cosori because you will be happier sooner than later. Lastly, please be sure to take out ALL the cardboard after unpacking and before cooking anything. I washed the basket but I was so excited to try it I had blind eyes to the cardboard which was still \"underneath\" the basket area. Very careless of me. All is well, and I use my Cosori every day."},{"reviewerName":"Gena Robyn","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Best air fryer hands down!","reviewDate":"October 7, 2019","reviewText":"I love, love, love this air fryer! I literally use it everyday. I researched several before taking the leap and purchasing this one and I’m so glad I did. Large square basket that feeds atleast a family of 4. The preset buttons cook spot on. So far, I have tried the fried chicken from the recipe book and my family said it was delicious. Nice and crispy. I temped the chicken and it was where it should be. I have always been nervous about cooking chicken on the bone, but not anymore! Being able to preheat the fryer makes cooking even faster, which I love. I’m on an eat clean low carb diet so I cook EVERY meal in it. When I’m cooking my food I normally just keep it at the 350 degrees 15 minute temp/time because it cooks so fast. It has a shake reminder, which I find very handy. Roasted mushrooms, zoodles, jalapeños, I couldn’t even name all that I cook in there but it’s very convenient and everything tastes great! It even crisps up frozen eggplant slices I have vacuum sealed in the freezer. Chicken slices coated in almond or coconut four come out CRISP. When you register your fryer you get an extra 1 year warranty so a total of 2 years Cosori will stand behind their product. The recipe book has tons of recipes with pictures that I can’t wait to tweak and make them where I can eat them. Or I could just make them how the book says and feed the others in my family :) Very detailed instruction booklet and quick reference guide included. Oh, and all the buttons on the touch panel are easy touch so you don’t have to worry about holding down a button or trying to get it to set right when you’re in the middle of cooking. I can go on and on about how much I love this thing, but I would probably put people to sleep!!

After looking around it seemed that Cosori has a decent reputation for support and that their non-stick has a good rep for not de-laminating. Enter a good sale and I purchased one.\n\nI think we have had it a little over a month and it has been used anywhere from once to four times a day. We cook a range of stuff from garlic bread to fried chicken, vegetables, fish sticks, hot dogs, fish, beef, french fries etc. in it.\n\nI gave up eating fried chicken a few years ago. My digestive tract isn't as friendly to greasy foods as it once was. I grew up in the south and fried chicken was a staple at my grandmothers house and my mom made it a lot also. When I left home I made it though not as often as I get irritated cleaning the spattered grease up. Finally with the digestive change it left my menu but I really missed it. Now it is back on the menu. I cook chicken a couple times a week now at least and it is great.\n\nfor better than my mom's or grandmothers breaded fried chicken I take oil of choice and rub a light layer onto a couple large chicken breasts, sprinkle with salt and pepper (or other seasoning of choice) and then sift a heavy layer of flour and pat it in. (I can no longer eat wheat so use rice or oat flour and it is absolutely wonderful.) Place the chicken in the air fryer and just use the stock setting for chicken. It is crispy on the outside and moist and tender on the inside. If you cut the chicken up into smaller portions you probably want to reduce the cooking time from 25 min to maybe 15 to 20.. you'll have to get a feel for it.\n\nFrench fries took a few tries get right.. fresh vs frozen are two different ways of cooking. Fresh use the recommended setting depending on how thick.. if thinner then reduce time a little maybe. frozen you need to reduce time by about a 1/3.\n\nFish sticks such as gortons frozen I use the chicken setting but reduce it to about 20 minutes.. they are lightly crunchy on the outside and moist and tender inside. other brands with thinner fish sticks need reduced cooking time so that they dont dry out.\n\nsausage dogs I use the chicken setting with about 18 minutes to get a bit of blackening and cracking of the skin going. For just cooked but not till the skin breaks probably 13 min maybe.\n\nanyways it is up there with our rice cooker and electric pressure cooker for devices we use a lot."},{"reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"missing the instruction book and recipe book prevent proper user.","reviewDate":"February 16, 2019","reviewText":"the instructions book and recipe book are missing.

This Cosori utilizes a different much better method that I feel will hold up well. I love that the drawer is dishwasher safe. So easy to clean and operate. It has become my favorite small appliance and is so incredibly functional. I see people complain about recipes this came with a fine starter book and there are more recipes that you could ever cook especially for air fryers online including the manufacturers website. Any conventional food instructions (as it states in the manual) can be adjusted time and temp wise to work wonderfully in an air fryer. The only thing I had trouble with was a whole chicken and that is because the chicken was too big I think. I have made baked brownies, cake and apple crisp, avocado eggs, nachos, and roasted veggies, all kinds of meats burgers, fish, pork chops, brats, chicken, even breasts frozen solid. Reheats food nicely without the microwave rubberiness. I do recommend getting an olive oil sprayer you can refill giving foods a spritz of oil makes all the difference for golden brown niceness. Great for cooking for one or two even three. Great for cooking a hot meal without using your oven in hot summer months. The square shape of this one is better too as you can fit more in and you don't have so much wasted counter space as the funny round models.

Fried foods are my favorites, but I hate cleaning up the mess. Even though I am on the keto eating plan, I still don't like cleaning up the mess of frying food, especially bacon. I knew a year ago I wanted an air fryer, and it took me awhile to pick out which one was right for me. I researched, and I read reviews. Finally I decided upon the Cosori. The main reason I picked this one were the reviews, not only for the air fryer, but for the positive Cosori customer service reviews.\n\nI waited to write this review because I wanted to see how I liked it. I've had it for two months now, and I purchased it at the regular price. I also have not had any reason to contact their customer service. I have used it everyday now, sometimes 2-3 times a day.\n\nIt is sooo easy to clean. After cooking, any grease I pour into an old coffee container, and then wipe it with paper towel before I use soap and a sponge (the soft side, not the scouring side.) The baskets can go into the dishwasher, but so far I have washed it by hand each time because I use it so often, and I don't run the dishwasher every day.\n\nI have cooked bacon, steaks, sausage patties, frozen chicken wings, frozen chicken breasts, hamburgers, hotdogs, vegetables, etc. I plan on experimenting with desserts eventually ... just haven't done it yet. The first week of using the air fryer, I overcooked a few items, especially frozen vegetables like broccoli, trying to figure out the time of cooking. No big deal. I ate it anyway. It has preset times, which I use every so often, but I wanted to understand the fryer so I experimented more. I only cook for three people, sometimes four, so the size is just right. If there is something in particular that I want to cook in it, I read air fryer recipes and ideas from others, then I adapt it to my likes and eating needs. I am so very happy with my purchase!!!!

I'm only giving it four stars at this time because I have yet to try out some of the other cooking features but will be happy to up it to five stars if I continue to be as please with it as I have been so far. I also really like the look of it; it's not a shiny black, it is more of a matte black which makes it match better with my other appliances. I also like that it's more square than round, fits better on my counter. It is rather large so if you don't have the counter space you might wish to order a smaller version. So far it's been one of the best things I've purchased for my kitchen in a long time."},{"reviewerName":"HTMAN","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"DOA...","reviewDate":"The manufacturer commented on the review below","reviewText":"I was excited to use this for the first time. I turned on and then it turned off its own and that was it. Never came back up. A bit disappointed for the inconvenience I have to go through in returning it. I went on and ordered a replacement, I guess things happen. Just a bit of disappointing if it is new? the face seemed it had hairlines swirls, not sure if it was a return. All looked new. Will update once I get a working unit.\n\n********UPDATE********\n\nOk, I received my replacement order Monday, Thank you Amazon! This is a night and day product compared to what I received before. First, the difference in delivered product. First, the external box was an \"Amazon\" badged box and smaller over all. 2nd, the box inside was a \"Cosori\" labeled box compared to what I had before (Leit or something like that). Third, the box inside the Cosori box was the actual box of the product (with all the pics of it). Lastly the big difference was the fact that the basket had tape holding the basket as many \"new\" products are done. All looked great, plus no Swirls on the face. A new product indeed. I have a feeling the first was a return. Not cool.\n\nNow for the product review.. Yesterday, I went crazy and cooked Battered frozen strips for kids and they were Crispy using the frozen option. Wow! Also, cooked fresh cut fries came out awesome. I think I cut them to thin, but the bigger ones were crispy and no oil (except for olive oil per instructions). Lastly last night, a NY and it was perfectly cooked, a nice Med Rare, it was great. Today, was another test. My daughter and I, mostly her cooked the Jalapeño popper from recipe book. They were great, only think I would of added to recipe was cream cheese, but followed directions for first time. Lastly, I cooked two giant chicken breast. I cooked then at 360 per online instructions, but I think the chicken preset would of done it just fine. Flipped them twice. Perfectly cooked at about 25-30 min.at 360. The president et is for 390 for 25.\n\nWish I took pics, but let me tell you, this Air fryer is awesome. Don't doubt yourself in purchasing. You will be happy with results. I research and went with this brand, plus you sign up for warranty they give you an extra year for free. Cant beat that deal! You have nothing to lose, except the oil much to gain with good cooking!\n\nGo for it! The one star less was from the beginning ordeal. Enjoy!"},{"reviewerName":"Greg","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Not Just Another Fad Appliance","reviewDate":"September 10, 2019","reviewText":"I bought this air fryer to assist in making chicken nuggets and fries for the kids. What I learned is it does so much more. I have evolved in to using it daily and cooking almost anything I would normally fry or bake using my stove/oven with much less cleanup and hassle. I have to admit, I am a sucker for new appliances. I jumped on sous-vide, which I actually think is the most delicious way to cook cuts of meat especially when entertaining or cooking large cuts but it takes time and some preparation and some mess (mainly in that you still have to use the stove or grill to sear the meat). Still love it but use less often than at first (it doesn't take much room so no bother). I then jumped on the insta-pot. Tried to use it a lot but now it has ended up mostly just being a smaller slow cooker than the one I have. The pressure cook feature (and other features) can be convenient but not worth having a bulky extra appliance for if you already have a slow cooker. Now comes to the air fryer. I had big concerns because of it's size - larger than the previous two things I mentioned. I saved all the packing material with expectation that I would ship it back. Much to my surprise, not only does it cook the fries/nuggets (and chicken wings I might add) much better than the oven, it cooks hamburger, chicken, steak, seafood, vegetables, garlic bread . . . almost everything you could cook on the stove/oven quickly and with a really good result (once you get a handle on the temp/time requirements). On top of that, the cooking is all contained so it doesn't make a mess of your stove, oven, countertops, or pans and it 's cooking tray is very easy to clean - imagine no grease to clean up from the stove area after frying.. I often make 2-3 different things sequentially which makes me at times wish I had two. That way I could cook the main and side dishes (ie. nuggets/fries) at the same time (although you probably can do it with just one but I have done that yet due to capacity). My stove/oven usage has dropped by at least 50-70%. Because of that, I leave this unit out all the time. It is bulky for a small kitchen (like mine) but fortunately I have a small table just off the kitchen in the breakfast area where this fits without being in the way. Yes, in the breakfast area because this makes no mess outside of the cooker and it looks attractive enough not to be an eye sore. Now lets talk size. I bought the 5.8qt and am so glad I did. One of the only two wishes I had for this unit is that it held more, although I find this to be mostly adequate for a family of four and I don't think I would want it to take up any more space. It can cook 3 - 4 large chicken breasts or 4 hamburgers at one time and I am sure it would cook bacon very well but you may not get more than 6- 8 slices in there. I don't think this brand is any better or worse in this regard compared to other brands of the same volume spec. I believe there are some models that have a rack so you can increase food capacity. I'm not sure how well this works but from simple observation of how air fying works I think it would. Also note, the smaller volume (ie. 3qt) versions are not that much smaller on the outside but noticeably smaller in cooking capacity.\nNow for the fryer review. Having not had another, I am very pleased with this model and would recommend. As I have noted, I like the way it cooks and looks. Food is very crispy on the outside and finished nicely on the inside and it cooks the entire contents very evenly. It seems to be well built and the cooking pan/parts are very easy to clean. The controls are logical and the buttons are touch sensitive. My second minor wish is that the buttons would be more consistent in their sensitivity but I realize they were designed this way for easy cleaning - so probably a worthwhile trade-off. In short I highly recommend this brand. I've only been using it a month and so far no problems. If I have any problems in quality or durability moving forward I will update this review. Most of all, I highly recommend having an air fryer. This is an appliance I can see myself using every day and for a long time."},{"reviewerName":"James Kay","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Surprised actually","reviewDate":"October 26, 2019","reviewText":"Have used it a dozen times and can see it's usefulness now. I think getting a good recipe down for the flour dusting used to dredging meats and seafood breading might take a while. I mock fried some butterflied shrimp I'd prepped with egg, flour and Panko. It came out pretty well but was clear heavily breaded stuff needs to be raised from the bottom of the basket. Solution is to purchase the optional kit of accessories. Which I did. Plus the extra basket.\nDefinitely seeing the efficiency of this thing.\nHate learning new icons but once you know the relative temps you're good.\nEven after you choose and icon setting you can fine tune the time and temp on the fly.\nNice clear alarms.

So good we bought three!","reviewDate":"October 10, 2019","reviewText":"As per the other reviews, our oven has become redundant. Had this beauty for over 8 month now and thought I'd share our experiences.\n\nWe had one which cooked everything to perfection but rather than trying to time different ingredients we bought another eg, steak in one fries in the other.\n\nThen we bought one for a family member.\n\nHere's what we cook to absolute perfection:\n\n- Bacon, perfectly crispy. Just press the bacon button. It's that easy.\n- Chicken thighs, gotta admit it I now eat the chicken skin. Never used to but it's crispy and delicious. Just press the chicken button. Walk away, come back. Enjoy.\n- Steak (you'll never use a pan again) maintains all the juices with a perfect all-round sear. Just figure out your own cooking times for how you like it cooked.\n- Fries, roast potatoes, potato wedges. Fluffy on the inside and crispy on the outside\n- Roasted vegetables, cooked with a little char\n- Breaded fish and chicken. Even the thickest pieces of say chicken are done in 5-8 minutes. Crispy, juicy and delicious. No fat. Amazing.\n\nWe pretty much use these little wizard gadgets for every home cooked meal.\n\nIt will take a while to figure out your perfect cooking times for steak, breaded chicken and so on. After that unplug your oven as you won't be using it.\n\nAnything you can cook in an oven, a pan or broiler will cook and taste so much better in the air fryer in more than half the time and with just a coating of spray oil.\n\nOur biggest gamble and success was had cooking Beef Wellington and it was the best we've ever made. The pastry was cooked evenly and to crispy perfection while the fillet was beautifully medium rare. That's a lot of expensive ingredients and preparation time to gamble. Gordon Ramsey's recipe, 6 minutes at 400 and 6 at 320. Job done. Gourmet.\n\nGive it a quick rinse and it's ready to conjure up the next delicious meal with the press of a button. Feels like cheating sometimes especially with steak coming out so well. Press a button walk away come back 5 minutes later and you've got restaurant quality steak.\n\nJust be sure to always pre-heat!\n\nNot sure about other cheaper airfryers. I know preheating is essential to the crispness which I'm not sure the others have."},{"reviewerName":"The Cains","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"The best Air Fryer in the market","reviewDate":"February 22, 2019","reviewText":"I am glad I got this Air Fryer from Cosori.

This is our first air fryer, and after doing extensive research on the internet and reading reviews for six plus months, we decided to purchase the Cosori air fryer. Ordered the extra assessories that they offered, and prepared a hot dog for my husband for lunch using the skewers/& rack. He thought it was tasty, but commented there wasn’t a lot of difference than in microwaving it. Then i cooked up some French fries and they were crisp and perfect! The clean up thus far seems to be easy, and the operation and directions, simple and easy to understand. The unit seems sturdy and well made! There is a great cookbook that is included with your purchase and looks like we will enjoy trying out different recipes. There is only one DISAPPOINTMENT for me, and that is, when cooking the French fries there is suppose to be a “shake reminder”, this function did not work. Other than that, we are thrilled with our Cosori Air Fryer, and would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for an incredible air fryer!

I have been going back and forth with the idea of purchasing an air fryer for about a year now but couldn’t justify spending over 100$ for one. This one came up on a Prime Day deal for around $70.. after reading all the reviews I decided to buy it and give it a try. The reviews did not lie! This thing is great! My 4 year old loves chicken nuggets and this thing cooked frozen chicken nuggets in 10 minutes and they came out so crispy.. I am so happy that I no longer have to worry about my 4 year old asking me 100 times If his chicken nuggets are done cooking. It also came with a recipe book that has so many other recipes and recommendations.. I was actually really surprised at how many different things you can cook in here (steaks, meatballs, chicken parm, muffins, French toast) I can’t wait to try them all. The presets are really convenient and the manual cooking is also really simple and it preheats in about 5 minutes which is awesome. Although this one is big and does take up a bit of counter space, it was a great purchase especially at the discounted prime day price. I’m very happy with this product so far and I’ve already recommended it to my friends. I will definitely be purchasing the accessory set to complete this in the near future.

Pre-heat makes getting set easy. Generous basket size. Amazingly non-stick, even in the base unit with bacon or longer fried foods. I've used foil to cover the base under the bracket to ease cleanup, but you really don't have to since it washes out SO EASILY. The snowflake icon button for frozen foods is just right and I have developed a habit of delicious frozen brussel sprouts air fried on a regular basis. Who would have thought? Perfect for households of two or three, or even four. Easy and fast chicken breasts or thighs or tenders, shrimp, asparagus, jicama fries, etc. Haven't tried steak since I prefer sous vide slower cooking for those followed by a quick pan sear, but burgers were good. Most pics show french fried potatoes, which are good, but don't overload the basket like those many photos show---that won't work well. Oh, and I love the \"shake\" reminder which comes on autamically on a few of the icon button foods.

I spray them with a little oil, season with italian seasoning, salt and pepper, cook at 400 for about 15-20 mins and they come out delicious.

If you select the frozen food preset you can adjust the time and temperature to your desire for your particular food type. Once you press the start button, the food will begin to cook and halfway through the elapsed time, the machine will beep and remind you to turn the food. This provides for very even cooking.

The rule of thumb of reducing temperature by 25 degrees and cooking time by 20 percent does not appear to hold true for this item. I have also found that with only a basket and no additional racks, the space for cooking is limited. I did buy other racks to put into the Air Fryer but the heat is distributed unevenly with the additional rack and again cooking times and temperatures need to be adjusted.

All of it has turned out perfectly. The chicken moist, the french fries crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside, the veggies all with a nice dark brown roast like we prefer. Even the chicken breast without skin or oil turned out moist and tender.

The first thing I cooked was chopped up potatoes and my mind was blown when they were perfect in 10 minutes. Ever since, we’ve cooked everything from steaks to chicken to veggies to mini pizzas to breakfast sandwiches. It truly is a life changing thing to come home for lunch and just dump some stuff in the basket and have it ready in 10~15 minutes and still have time to enjoy a lunch break for once.\n\nI also really like the pre-set options. I noticed other hair dryers just have temp dials and idk how people who aren’t familiar with air fryers would figure that out so it’s nice to be able to just push a button and let ‘er go. The drawer is a little tough to get out at first until you get used to it. And the product photo is a little misleading and makes the screen look more high tech than it is.

It makes great french fries from scratch and makes crispy tater tots no oil needed. Also I made hamburger patties on the steak setting and pork chops. The pork chops came out pretty crispy but I did notice that putting just one allows the meat to crisp up more than having two peices. I would say this works better for individual meals than for large quatities when it comes to meat. I feel that this fryer gets a bad rep because the cooking times in the cookbook are wrong but the temperature at which they should cook at are right. A lot of the times when I let the food fry for the time said in the cookbook it would burn. My recommendation would be to cook the food for less time than precribed and then if it needs more time simply add more time. That is how I started to get better results whith the airfryer because it acctually does a good job. Its just the cookbook thats off.

Love this thing - I was able to get rid of my griddle, deep fryer and small toaster oven now that I have this."},{"reviewerName":"Sanjana Bryant","rating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Persistent plasticky smell forced return =(","reviewDate":"The manufacturer commented on the review below","reviewText":"I really wanted to love this airfryer! It has a large capacity, heats up well and fast, and easy to clean.

So disappointed. =("},{"reviewerName":"thoughtful consumer","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great appliance if you have the space and understand this isn’t a true fryer","reviewDate":"The manufacturer commented on the review below","reviewText":"I’ve had this Air Fryer for about a week, and so far it hasn’t disappointed. I like the square basket-I think it fits food better. I was able to easily fit 6 chicken tenders with room for at least 2-3 more. Cleaning the basket (and the base that the basket rests in) has been very easy, but I do use a soft-bristle kitchen brush on a long handle to get into all the openings in the basket. The air fryer is big and does take up counter space, but it’s not heavy to move around. I keep it on my rolling kitchen cart and move it to my counter to use it. I do rest it on a large, wooden cutting board when using just in case the bottom gets warm. The instructions are easy to understand, and using the control panel is fairly intuitive. I haven’t used the pre-settings. I prefer to set my own temperature and time. The vent in the back releases hot air when in use. I was able to put my hand about two inches from the vent without difficulty. Still, I give about 5” of space on all sides just to be safe. I didn’t find it too loud. I mean, it circulates hot air with a fan so there’s going to be some noise, but It didn’t annoy me.\nSo far I’ve made French fries with russet potatoes, a chocolate cake (see photo) and chicken tenders (homemade, not frozen. See photo). All three items turned out delicious. The cake was divine-especially the second day (I have no idea why). The chicken tenders were crunchy on the outside and not the least bit dry on the inside. The fries would have been over-cooked had I left them in for the full amount of time the recipe called for. They were crisp on the outside. The cake recipe stated 30 minutes at 330 degrees. My attempt took 55 minutes at 330 degrees. I wasn’t surprised by this. I thought 30 minutes seemed too short. My advice is, check your food often at first to get a feel for the fryer. This is really no different than getting used to a new oven or other cooking appliance. You need to play around with times and temperatures a bit. Also, get a good air fryer cookbook or some highly-rated recipes online.\nPros:\n-Easy to use, intuitive\n-easy clean up\n-keeps kitchen cool in summer\n-don’t have to heat up your oven for a small amount of food\n-1 to 2 minutes to preheat or no preheating for some recipes\n-Large basket, and square shape seems to fit food very well\n-basket has a safety feature so you won’t accidentally release it from the base it sits in\n-much healthier than deep fried foods, but you can still get that crispy crunchiness\nCons:\n-It’s large. You will lose counter space unless you can store it somewhere and take it out when needed.\n-if you are cooking for a large group, you’re going to be cooking in batches. The basket size works fine for our family of three with two light eaters, but even one more person at the table would have me cooking in batches.\n-If your looking for something to give you the same, exact taste as genuine fried food, this isn’t for you. It’s not an actual fryer. The name is deceiving. It’s really a countertop convection oven. The recipes use minimal oil (1 Tbsp for the fries I made and several sprays of olive oil on the chicken tenders with an olive oil spritzer).\nI would recommend this model so far without hesitation, but it’s only been one week and three recipes. If anything changes, I’ll update my review. I hope this helps you make a decision."},{"reviewerName":"Matt","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"OMG THIS THING IS AWESOME ~ KETO AVOCADO FRIES?!!!

Go out of their way to help you","reviewDate":"September 27, 2019","reviewText":"Before anything else, i bought this product about a year ago and have been using it happily since. It works amazingly and cooks food perfectly with the pre-set settings. Fully frozen chicken breasts get cooked in no time and i have an easy and healthy dinner.\nNow then, Onto the customer support experience! I had to deal with them twice so far. First happened on day one, i had a rare issue of the product being defective. I unpacked it and cleaned it as directed, plugged it in, and it turned on, then 5-10 minutes later, it would just power down for no reason and not come back on. Using their book i figured out it was over-heating for some unknown reason as if i let it cool down for a half hour or so, it would turn on and go back to working seemingly like normal then after another 5 minutes of trying to pre-heat, would shut off again. I was upset and decided to try calling the Cosori customer support rather than going through amazon. The people at their support center worked with me for a few minutes trying to diagnose the problem and came to the conclusion, it was defective. They immediately offered me a replacement and sent it out, 2 day shipping, completely free of charge as they should. The key here is they didn't try to accuse me of breaking the thing, or anything else. They did everything they could to help then when they couldn't they offered to make it right. The new one arrived and has been working flawlessly until today. During regular cleaning a screw fell out of the basket. When i tried to see where the screw was supposed to go, a nut fell out of the handle as well. I'm assuming the screw went into the obvious hole in the basket, and locked into that nut which was buried somewhere inside the handle. The issue here is there's no easy way to put this nut back into place. I couldn't take the handle apart past a certain point, and the nut had to be inserted inside the handle somewhere for the screw to then attach. I called Cosori support again and explained my issue hoping they could just walk me through putting the thing back together as i figured they must know a way. After hearing what i said they didn't even bother trying to fix it, just apologized for the the basket breaking and offered to send me a replacement basket. I was stunned and agreed. I received an email from them , provided my order details, and my replacement basket will be on the way soon.\nThese people bend over backwards to help you and stand by their product and its so rare to find a company willing to do that. This product alone worked great, but whats really selling me on their brand is their customer support. I can safely buy their stuff and know its going to work right, and if it doesn't they are going to work with you and do everything they can to make it right. Cannot recommend them enough and will continue to buy Cosori products in the future."},{"reviewerName":"Larry","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Handle falls off the basket after four months of use","reviewDate":"The manufacturer commented on the review below","reviewText":"My wife and I love this 5.8 qt air fryer. I was never much of a cook until we bought this fryer. Now I cook wings, sausages, and lots of other things in it. In fact, I cooked so much that I have now worn out the basket handle after four months of use. Two out of three screws that hold it together came out, and the handle just flops around. I managed to find one of the screws in the sink drain just after it fell out and before the disposal ruined it. However, the second one is nowhere to be found. Fortunately, the handle will kinda work with just two screws holding it together, but the whole thing feels less secure than it did with three screws. I have ordered a couple of spare baskets so I can keep using the fryer, but I am not happy with paying $25 a pop for a manufacturing issue. The screws should have been mounted so they would not back out under normal use and washing."},{"reviewerName":"M.

It revitalizes left overs, giving a crispiness that cannot be achieved in the microwave and you do not have to heat your entire oven to warm a few things. The 5 min pre-heat is an excellent feature which I could not find on many competitor models. Last night my 16 year old son cooked tomato, provolone, and basil stuffed chicken breasts... they were tender and juicy in a way I have never gotten from cooking in the oven and they took a fraction of the time to cook. The large basket size allows for easy cooking for my family of 4 with room to spare. I am still learning the settings, but I am more comfortable with it after every use. I could see this replacing not only my deep frier but my oven for many meals! It has a smaller footprint than my current 1/2 gallon deep frier and I think it will get a coveted counter top storage place as I can see us using it so much that it would be pointless to keep putting away.

Cooked in it 2 hours ago...DELICIOUS results. I had purchased a Gormia from costco 2 months ago and it died 3 nights ago.. Did a couple hours research on the net and decided on this fryer. First, it is just plain beautiful to look at; I got the white unit. Instead of manually cooking chicken thighs, I decided to use the \"chicken drumstick\" button on the unit. It was set to 380 degrees for 25 minutes. I decided to let it go and see what happens. With my previous air fryer, I used 400 degrees for 25 minutes. This \"toasted\" a darker finish on my chicken at 20 degrees cooler and it turned out so very tasty. If you don't have an air fryer, GET ONE!!

Following the cook book that came with it word for word, they came out amazing. The burgers where full of juice when you cut into them. It was way easier than ever to use and clean up was simple. I can't believe how much cleaner the kitchen was compared to using a a cast iron skillet or traditional deep fryer. We are excited to try so many different meals and options in the new Air Fryer.

I contacted Cosori directly through their customer service. I have to say I was very pleasantly surprised. They asked me to supply them with a few numbers off our fryer, and a picture of what the display looked like. That was it. I had a new one so quickly I couldn't believe it. This one has never had a hiccup. I cooks bacon better than anything I've ever used. Frozen onion rings, corn dogs for the grandkids - I love it! Cleanup is so easy. The grease basin and the food tray come apart and they are both dishwasher safe. However, they are so easy to wash that I seldom put them in the dishwasher. One of the things I like best about it is that the frying tray is square. Many of the air fryers I looked at had odd shaped trays. I am not a fan of kitchen gadgets. I don't like appliances lined up on my counter. This is an exception. I use it every day, so it IS on my counter all the time. It's quite attractive, so I don't mind.

I wasn’t familiar with using an air fryer, but the booklet that came with the fryer was easy to follow. I bought the larger size (5.8 qt), even though there are just two of us. My reasoning was that we sometimes cook additional food in order to have leftovers and, secondly, because I wanted to be able to cook enough to feed our daughter as well when she comes over.\nThe first meal I cooked was thick lamb chops. I marinated them a bit and easily fit all four in the fryer. I followed the cooking time in the recipe book and they were absolutely perfect! Browned on all sides, exactly the right temperature, tender, and delicious. Next, vegetables. I usually roast them in the oven and get them super crispy and browned. I was skeptical the fryer would be able to replicate this, but I was wrong- Brussels sprouts, asparagus, broccoli, squash- all perfect. Another outstanding meal was boneless chicken breast- dredge in a little panko and flour, egg wash, and into the fryer (no oil needs, but did spray the breasts with Pam). They were incredibly moist and wonderful. Also did chicken wings- another winner! Salmon, halibut- no problem.\nCleanup is very easy- we do not put ours in the dishwasher. The basket and tray are very easy to wash out. I use the recipe book that comes with the fryer as well as a couple of others I ordered online. I supplement with an internet search when I don’t see what I want in one of the books. Of the books I have, I think the book that came with the fryer is pretty good.

I swapped it around to different outlets in and out of the kitchen, hoping that it was actually my home electrical system (that's how much I wanted this machine to work).

I definitely signed up for the extended warranty, but I feel that i may not need to use it---no issues at this point, with my Cosori. It is easy enough to clean, but I did go ahead and purchase some parchment paper mats for its pan, as a way of protecting the pan, because I want to keep my air fryer in tip-top shape. I do follow all the instructions concerning it, and make sure that it's has room around it for it to \"breathe\" and not become overheated.

My spouse who is not a cook loves the fryer so much he has actually planned dinners, looked up recipes, and went grocery shopping for home cooked meals. I came home from a long trip and was treated to a delicious steak dinner..The steak was juicy and tender and just delicious. It's user friendly and affective. Our food has never over cooked. Were recommend you check the food half way thru to check for doneness. It has a pause button so you can check the food. Clean up is easy as well. We chose this air fryer because of the size and amount of food it can hold. There will be a little noise like air circulating but it's not overwhelming and doesn't bother us at all. Happy with our air fryer and would recommend as an alternative to using the oven or frying pan"},{"reviewerName":"Ryan","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Love it, but it cooks way faster than it says so keep that in mind","reviewDate":"September 14, 2019","reviewText":"I burned the first 5 or 6 things we cooked in here because it just cooks way faster than the instructions say. I've found the cooking temp to be about 50 degrees less than the oven and cooking time to be 1/3 to 1/2 of oven. Just keep in mind you can always put something back in to cook longer but you can't come back from overcooked or burnt. Now that we've adjusted we are loving how fast it cooks and that everything comes out juicer and more flavorful than deep frying, with the danger, mess, health concerns, and without heating the house up using the oven. Highly recommend air fryers in general and I think we made a good choice in picking this one."},{"reviewerName":"Greg M.","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"This one is big, but works oh so very well.","reviewDate":"August 1, 2019","reviewText":"This is a large piece of kitchen appliance. It was much larger than I thought it would be. It takes up a large space on the counter.\nIt works extremely well. The rectangular basket holds a surprisingly large amount of anything. It cooks things just as well as baking in the oven, but just a few minutes quicker, and also using less energy.\nI'm still trying new recipes, but so far everything I have tried to cook in it has come out absolutely delicious and, most importantly, free of the cooking oils I'd need for pan frying.\nThe only real downside it the pans are so large I can only fit the pans in the dishwasher with nothing else.

I bought this on a daily deal and used it after a couple of weeks of buying it being still sceptic of it's abilities.\nWhen I used it first time, it blew my mind. Not fried, but fried? It was like \" I can't believe it's not butter\".\nMake sure that you buy the biggest version though since 5.8 was barely enough to put a whole chicken in it, so buying a smaller version is not a good idea."},{"reviewerName":"Nicole","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Love it so much!","reviewDate":"July 29, 2019","reviewText":"I am really loving this air fryer.

I've seen other fryers that were circle, and for some reason I never liked it, so I'm really happy this is square. Second, it's sooo easy to clean and it's dishwasher safe which is a plus. Lastly, it makes cooking SOO much easier and faster. So far I have only cooked regular potatoes and sweet potatoes but I can't believe how easy it is. Cut it up, drizzle some olive oil, put it in the air fryer and FORGET ABOUT IT. The potatoes come out crispy and delicious.

My first was the GoWISE GW22621 4th gen which would be my 2nd favorite but it didn't fit as much in the basket because it was round and the teflon came off pretty quickly - gave it to my son. Then I decided to go big and get the GoWISE USA 3.7-Quart 7-in-1 GW22621 - it was BIG and EXPENSIVE but it filled my house up with smoke and fat globules when I cooked bacon and I had to open the doors and windows. The timer also didn't work correctly. I returned it and got the Cosori because of the reviews and price. I have had it for about 2 months now and I couldn't be happier. it has a nice sized square basket that you can place more food in with more surface area to crisp it. I have cooked lots of items in it and am very happy with the results. Steaks are phenomenal ... well so is the hamburgers and chicken with a great mallard affect but still moist in the middle. Bacon is amazing and cleanup is a breeze. I enjoy the fries and have even made an impressive and delicious calzone with a ww 2 ingredient dough that was the best I have eaten anywhere. Enjoy this air fryer immensely! The last air fryer I got was the ninja which also is pressure cooker etc. I do enjoy this as well but cooking surface is much smaller and so prefer the corsori over the ninja if all you are looking at is the air fryer - get a instant pot with it and you'll be happy and have all the latest kitchen gadgets that makes preparing meals easy and flavorful."},{"reviewerName":"Jilly","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great fryer","reviewDate":"June 2, 2019","reviewText":"I did not want another kitchen appliance or gadget as I already have the coffee maker on the counter.

I was using it multiple times per day. After several weeks of use, it was obvious we were getting a lot of use out of it so we got this larger one. It is so easy to clean and use.

There is a user manual which you should take the time to read and a recipe book about 110 pages of recipes. was starving but I went over it and over the manual.\nAs my pictures show it was larger than I thought as I live in an apt. Make sure you have counter space to have 5\" from your wall as steam escapes from the rear.\n*** There is a plastic cover over the basket release button. Please make sure it's in place so it won't be pushed by accident. It will release the inner basket which is holding the outer basket and also have a solid surface to place it on before you release. I put mine on the large burner on my stove as there wasn't enough room on counter. It was enough room to pull it out so I could flip the scallops.\nI didn't release it until I was ready to wash it. I had to give a slight tug to remove basket from fryer because it is new. It should slid out easier with more use. The manual is very informative and the display is easy to use with pictures of preset food items.\nI will purchase additional accessories such as ramakens, cake and pie pan as some recipes call for them. I do have some small glass containers I can use. You can use Pyrex or anything you can use in an oven. Also a sprayer for oil.\nMy first use was for jumbo scallops. I didn't have a sprayer so I used paper towels to dab olive oil lightly and Old Bay seasoning. There wasn't a recipe or temp and cook time so I did a search online. I did preheat of 390 and cooked at 390 for 2 mins each side. Checked and did another minute. I should of used the preset fish instead of shrimp but I'm learning.\nThey came out delicious. They don't get brown like searing them in butter but the Old Bay added some color to them. I have Alaskan Pollack fillets I am trying next and pork chops. So far I love it and look forward to using it daily.\nI will do an update.\n***Update*** Love cooking with this! issue is the cookbook fell apart and I had only browsed through it once and a metal prong seperated from the skewer rack so I went down a star."},{"reviewerName":"Vickie","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Did not work","reviewDate":"The manufacturer commented on the review below","reviewText":"Hoping for a replacement..."},{"reviewerName":"lj","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Mothers day gift 2019","reviewDate":"March 17, 2019","reviewText":"It's a Mothers day gift so I have no Idea how it works."},{"reviewerName":"MontanaMomOfBoys","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"I’m in love with an Air Fryer.","reviewDate":"July 3, 2019","reviewText":"I’m in love with an air fryer.

Unfortunately my experience with the Cosori Air Fryer has been nothing but disappointing. I’ve used it to cook steak which took much longer to cook than the literature suggested and it didn’t brown up at all. I’ve tried cooking French fries using raw potatoes and after nearly 30 minutes at 400 degrees I had limp fries that I wasn’t interested in eating. I’ve tried frozen French fries that I even sprayed lightly with canola oil hoping to help crisp them up, and again ended up with limp fries after nearly 30 minutes.

I have tried a variety of meals, and everything has come out great. Fish, chicken wings, eggs, garlic bread, steak, you name it.\n\nYou do have to manage your expectations though. You're not going to get deep-fried flavour out of this, because the food doesn't sit in the oil. It does an ok job. but it's closer to baked than fried. Fries/potatoes come out somewhere in between baked/deepfried. There's also no tossing mechanism, so the food doesn't rotate on its own.\n\nI also continually underestimate how fast it cooks food. I have routinely started it, and then started working on sides, only for it to finish far faster than whatever else I'm doing. I'm honestly considering getting two of the things just so I can do two things at the same time.\n\nUtterly simple to clean.

We've used this air fryer at least 25 times or more since having it over last few weeks. Each time the food has been great and the cleanup has been simple.\n\nThis is worth the cost.\n\nThe cookbook has been quite helpful as well for both ideas on what to cook in it and as a guide for cooking times on stuff you normally cook in a big oven. No longer do we need to heat up the big oven to cook a few chicken tenders or heat up some other small item.

Checked again before time was up – they were over done (very brown and dry). Placed on warm cycle while pork and corn were heated (4 minutes). Potatoes continued to cook and were just shy of being charcoal. Third try was broccoli. It also turned out overdone and somewhat charred. Last attempt was an egg test.

It’s been super hot in SoCal, I’ve used the air fryer almost every single day to make fries, hot dogs, homemade meatballs and salmon patties, frozen dumplings, toasted bread, reheated leftovers, etc. I appreciate how quickly the preheat happens, the hot air circulated nicely to cook food evenly and quickly. I move the air fryer to the backyard when I cook so it doesn’t heat up my house and I keep the cooking smells outside. The one trick I would suggest for any airfryer is to be sure to shake the basket every 5-7 minutes. Shaking makes a world of difference. The basket holds more than enough food for the 2 of us.

My actifry finally broke and I went in search of a replacement. I googled best air fryers and this was number one on the list.\n\nI can't believe how easy it is to cook with this appliance. The buttons are all very user friendly. The basket is coated in non stick and has generous air holes but they aren't large enough that food falls through. It has been a breeze to clean. I've had it for a week and we've made fried chicken, schnitzel, Brussels sprouts, tater tots, fries, mozzarella sticks, pot stickers and jalapeno poppers in it. Everything turned out great and nothing was hard to clean up, not even the fried chicken. The bottom basket/tray is also coated in non stick. I soaked it in warm water for 5 minutes and it wiped clean.\n\nI have a family of 5 and we had to split the fried chicken into 2 batches. It comfortably fit 4 thighs in one batch and a breast and 4 legs in the next. I just kept the first batch on a plate covered to keep warm and then popped them back in for a minute after the 2nd batch to heat them up."},{"reviewerName":"Gisel Collier","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"What oven?","reviewDate":"October 6, 2019","reviewText":"I bought this back in July....and we looooooove it. I bought the 5.8 one because I usually make enough dinner so my husband can take lunch the next day. It has been perfect! An 8x8 pan sits in it perfectly, which means my 30 week pregnant self has been making freezer meals so we can have ready-made dinners once baby is here.\nSo far I’ve made full racks of ribs in it, muffins, cheesecakes, bacon, eggs, grilled cheese, all kinds of meat and veggies, biscuits....you name it. I know this is one appliance that if it goes out, I will replace without hesitation. (By the way, the only think that I have not liked in it was a steak. I like my steaks cooked on cast iron so they have a good sear. Some may like it in the air fryer...I, personally, didn’t.)\nMy gas bill has dropped because I use the Cosori air fryer daily instead of my oven!

Besides, it was on sale on Prime Day. Well, it has exceeded my expectation. I've made chicken, pork, veggies, fries, and even roasted almonds and walnuts. It's basically a handy little oven on my kitchen counter. Although it took a bit of experimenting to get the right \"crispness\" level, since sometimes things can come out a bit more charred than I prefer. The cleanup isn't difficult. The baskets are dishwasher safe, and I wipe down the interior with a moist paper towel after it has cooled. I wish I had bought the smaller size though. 5.8 Quart is a bit large for two people, and takes up quite a bit of counter space.

Would I use it enough to justify buying one? I looked at quite a few air fryers in the process of trying to make up my mind. It became clear to me that if I was going to get one, it needed to be a larger one to make it worth it. I had never heard of Cosori before, but it was an Amazon’s Choice and had good reviews. I liked the look of it and that it had a more squared basket than round. It was a little more money than I had initially wanted to spend, but I went for it. So glad I did! I love this thing! It is so easy to operate and clean, and food tastes great and cooks so quickly! It’s my new toy! It seems to be well made, but I got an additional year on the warranty when I registered it (just in case). I’ve made chicken twice, steak, asparagus, eggplant, and broccoli twice. Very pleased with the results.

Had held off on buying an air fryer, because I didn't really understand them well. A friend's wife kept telling me that she uses it all the time and how great hers was. Actually saw her use hers one weekend and thought time to do this. Bought the Cosori and love it. I thought what the heck, I'll make buffalo chicken wings. Verdict: tastes just like the restaurant. Again, I didn't understand how an air fyer worked, so I thought there was hot oil at bottom and air would circulate throughout. Nope, not how it works. No oil. But I will tell you this: those wings tasted every bit like they were 'fried'. They were delicious.

Despite ready made crusts or biscuits and canned pie filling, everything is delicious and quick. I did prepare my own blueberry filling with fresh blueberries. My next project will be pretzels!\n\nI would recommend this to anyone of any age. I think this XL size is good even if you cook for one or two.

I have found the recipe book settings to be too much. I have burned a few things. My advice - check your food several times after the half-way time. Whether or not the meat is room temperature may make a big difference in cooking times.\n\nI like the oven fry potatoes a lot. The thinner you slice them, the crispier they get. I have cooked 2 large russet potatoes in there, but it might hold up to 4. For smaller food items likes fries, it is imperative that you toss them at the midpoint, otherwise they have zebra stripes at the end.\n\nI also like chicken thighs, super easy. I like to marinate them in olive oil and teriyaki sauce, but the great thing is, you can use any marinade- barbecue sauce, chipotle sauce, tikka masala sauce, anything. My wife likes harissa sauce. The basket holds 4. I have found that 20 minutes is too long. Crispy on the outside, juicy and tender on the inside.\n\nNegatives - the unit is noisier than I anticipated, about the sound of your stove top hood running on medium. The non stick coating seems thin, I have already scratched it. Rubber tipped tongs are recommended. The basket is not easy to get totally clean.\n\nA 5 minute warm-up is recommended, but I'm going to experiment with shortening that. Most cooking times are going to be 15-20 minutes, so it's 20-25 minutes per batch."},{"reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Best small kitchen appliance purchase ever!","reviewDate":"March 1, 2019","reviewText":"I bought one of these on a whim thinking I would give it a try.

Chicken wings did great, pork chop a little tough but flavorful and chicken wings were the best...very juicy and tender. My only complaint is I would like a chart, and even on some of the recipes, that showed the weight of the meat used. You can buy pork chops that are paper thin to over 1 inch thick. Cooking times are not equal and not all fryers are equal. I downloaded a chart off the internet that is a start. So I guess trial and error will be the norm until I can get used to the cooker.

Usually I don't even use oil, just some cooking spray.\n\nI've made fries (obviously) both fresh and frozen, panko fish for fish tacos, wings, bacon, fried chicken and even roasted a full chicken! Everything comes out amazing! Crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. I was skeptical to buy one of these things, but after a lot of research I finally caved and I'm so glad I finally purchased one. Don't think you can only make food in the air fryer that are normally fried. You can pretty much use this air fryer for anything you'd put in your oven.\n\nThis is the second air fryer I purchased. The first one was cheaper and after I tried it out, I liked it so much I invested some more and got this Cosori. It's bigger and had some nice extra features the cheaper one didn't.

Buy a convection oven, load a whole chicken and veggies in it, hit the button and wait for an amazingly easy, and delicious, dinner is done in very little time."},{"reviewerName":"Robert D.","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great for Wings","reviewDate":"The manufacturer commented on the review below","reviewText":"I would have given this 5 stars, BUT.....The Recipe book states to flip the chicken wings half way trough the cooking time limit. The Pre set for Chicken is 25 Min at 380. There is no warning to stop ad flip said chicken. The Pre set for Fries is also 25 Min at 380, Guess what, it automatically pause at 13 Min, and tells you to \"Shake the Fries\". So, when I cooked Wings on the pre set Fries setting...……….PERFECT! I would have given this 5 stars , had it the \"Flip\" warning at 13 minutes for Chicken. No smoke, very little odor when cooking Chicken. Very good product. I also cooked Quiche, again...……...perfect. Amazon had this on sale for $100, a day after our current Fryer took a Dirt np, and this one is pretty amazing. Last one...……...pretty bad. Buy this, period. I also recommend buying the kit for the cooking peripherals, well worth it."},{"reviewerName":"Harirajah A.

I now find myself cooking at least some part of most of my meals in it. Bacon, steak, frozen fries, chicken - you name it. Incredibly easy to use and cooks most items quickly. I find myself experimenting with various recipes. One of my favorites was brussel sprouts. I cut them in half, tossed some salt, pepper, and balsamic vinegar on them and then cooked them in the air fryer for about 10 minutes at 350. Good stuff."},{"reviewerName":"happy shopper","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Change the way you cook - BUY IT!","reviewDate":"May 8, 2019","reviewText":"Changed my life! If you don't have an air fryer, GET ONE! This Cosori is fantastic because it is larger than the round ones. I have another air fryer, which was a gift and I loved it, but smaller. Just needed a second one for our 2nd home. And I wanted bigger. The ease of use, faster cooking times, better flavors and healthier cooking makes me happy every time I use. No hot kitchen from using your stove oven in the summer! Baked potatoes (any potatoes) come out fantastic. Meats (chicken, pork chops, steaks) are delicious and moist/juicy. I haven't baked anything in it, but plan on doing. Once you start using, you won't ever want to turn your oven on. Can't say enough about air frying, and this model is fantastic!"},{"reviewerName":"Kindle Customer","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Perfect for KETO and whatever you throw at it.","reviewDate":"July 24, 2019","reviewText":"After trying several air fryers, I settled on the COSORI. Ordering was easy and delivery was fast (Prime Member). Setup was easy, good instructions! The first try was with bacon...everyone on Keto knows bacon. Other fryers required the bacon to be cut in half to fit. The COSORI has the largest basket of all the fryers, so no cutting and I put 8 thick cut slices. Used the preheat function - really cool feature. Set the timer for 12 minutes and waited - perfect bacon. Works well for chicken breasts, wings, etc. Lots of recipes in the instruction book. Easy cleanup.

Even the kids admit that store bought fries and nuggets taste better when I make them in the air fryer. Extremely time saving when I'm hungry and don't want to spend a lot of time cooking...and cleanup is ALMOST as simple as rinsing it out (light scrubbing and the nonstick surfaces are easily cleaned).

This is kind of square which fits on my counter much better than the round one. Made a few dinners and everything came out perfect. Clean up was better than my last.

I use this for almost everything frozen like eggrolls, burritos, chicken nuggets, and French fries. It's so easy and convenient to use, I have almost retired my microwave. The removable basket and basin are really easy to clean having a Teflon coating. There is a learning curve though. I first sprayed my whole thawed chicken with olive oil in order for the seasoning to stick. I soon learned you could fill a kitchen with smoke pretty easy if you don't take some precautions. Putting a little water in the basin and using an oil with a higher smoke point fixed the problem for me. everything else goes straight from the freezer to the basket and out hot and crispy.

I pre-heated the unit by pressing the pre-heat icon, which goes on for 5-minutes, then pressed the shrimp icon, and 6-minutes later I had DELICIOUS shrimp!\n\nAll I did to season was dump the defrosted shrimp in a bowl, spray them with olive oil, dumped garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper on them. That's it!\n\nThe tray is a bit small as-is, you can likely only fit a few adult-sized cutlets in there, so hopefully I can find a rack for the tray. There's a lot of \"dead space\" at the top of the tray. You'd likely be better off making chicken stripes, instead of cutlets, and going that route.\n\nAnyhow, this air fryer is AMAZING.

I did a lot of research and recently purchased this model and I absolutely love it! Everything I have tried has come out great. Steaks, chicken, fritattas, veggies...all cook and taste so good and it takes hardly any time at all. I bought accessories to go with it and I use those to cook an entire meal at once or to reheat items instead of placing them in the microwave. I don't cook any \"french-fried\" foods so I cannot comment on how it does with those types of foods but it is exactly what I wanted...a versatile and easy to use cooking tool for quick healthy meals. Simply add water and dishsoap after cooking, let it soak for a bit and it cleans right up....no scrubbing. Highly recommend."},{"reviewerName":"Michele W","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Awesome air fryer!","reviewDate":"March 20, 2019","reviewText":"I bought a different product originally and the knobs were hard to use and the tray didn’t slide in easily.

It does make a fair amount of fan noise, but it’s not overly annoying.\n\nDredged whitefish has been great. Tater-tots with just one very small shot of grapeseed oil on the basket has been phenomenal. Calamari we need to tweak our time/temp, but still very good.\n\nI’d suggest a very soft cloth and a very small shot of a cleaner like “greased lightning” or similar to cut the small film you might get on the touchpad front.\n\nOverall, very content with this purchase."},{"reviewerName":"M.A.W.","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"LOVE!

After looking at all the options available and reading ratings we decided to give this one a try and OMG we are in LOVE! This is seriously a game changer for cooking. We bought it with the expectation that it would get put away in between uses because it's a little big. Well, we use it SO much it has a permanent home on our counter now. Not only can you fry food in here but you can cook vegetables (roast), meats, reheat food and so much more and without any oil. We have made fried chicken, fried pork chops, whole roasted chicken, roasted broccoli, cauliflower, etc. and so much more and everything turns out perfect each time.

Chicken tenders, bacon, frozen sweet potato fries, crab cake, filet mignon, and an Beyond Burger all came out perfect. We did try a chicken parmesan that was just okay, bc you can't really flip it. We got the 5.8 QT and it fits well beneath our counter. If you are entertaining or cooking for a family, I'd say get the 5.8. I can easily get 4-6 strips of bacon at once.

First off I'm not an oven person, I grill and anything I oven, fries, egg rolls, and any frozen products just tastes blah. But when I use this air fryer its awesome and it's so easy.

I love fish, but we did not like to prepare it because of the house smell in the regular stove, however with our Cosori Air fryer, we just take it out to our patio and cook the fish outside.

This is an excellent machine. There isn't anything it doesn't do! I made chicken wings within 3 hrs of unboxing it and they came out perfectly! Even garlic toast was crooked to perfection! Shaking and turning is a must for even browning when making certain items and the preset buttons alert you when it's time. Even my 16yo said he wants one of his own when he moves out...lol My only reason for giving four stars is that the basket is hard to pull out because of how it snaps into place.

The first one was Cook's, the one they advertised on TV, it had a 30 day warranty, it lasted 4 months, the second one I bought was a smaller one called Go Wise, so far so good, I love the black finish, it was much better than the gray finish the Cook's had. I decided to buy another but I wanted a bigger one to cook a whole chicken with. This air fryer is terrific to clean up, comes off so easy and it has a black finish. So, I tried today to cook the whole chicken but I shouldn't of rubbed it with olive oil, it smoked up my kitchen from the oil, next time I am going to just put spices on it, the chicken tasted great even though I smoked up the whole house. I love the warranty and the customer service I got when I called, they are happy to help you out. I would of given 5 starts but 4.5 because the fan is quite noisy, my husband has to raise the voice on the TV to hear it, sounds like an airplane.

I loved that I didn’t have to heat up my whole kitchen by turning on my oven and I’m hoping it will help with my electric bill (everything in my house is electric) and the clean up was a breeze.

It is very quiet when running. Cleaning is a complete snap. The outside stays cool and even the exhaust isn't all that warm. Temperatures seem accurate. The slight rubbery smell went completely away after we ran it empty a few times at 450. Adjusting time and temperature are easy once you get used to the order of pushing the buttons. One thing we don't mind but worth mentioning is that the three screws that hold the handle onto the basket loosen and need tightening about once a month. If they get too loose the drawer gets difficult to insert. If yours gets difficult to latch, check this as the likely cause. Other than that, reliability is great - we've used it most days for going on six months, no problems."},{"reviewerName":"Bill","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Makes puddles on your counter from the leaking steam... Support says that's perfectly normal!","reviewDate":"November 6, 2019","reviewText":"Air fryer works. One major complaint is the basket / drawer leaks steams as it cooks which leaves puddles on whatever surface you have the air fryer. If you press lightly on the basket / drawer the steam stops leaking out which means either the product wasn't designed well or manufacturing tolerances are poor. Even though it works, I wouldn't recommend as the mess it makes it just too annoying to keep cleaning up after every use.\n\n** Updated 11/11/19 **\n\nAfter Cosori support saying that leaking steam from the basket is normal, I am reducing my overall rating to 1 star as this product is clearly made cheaply / poorly designed. Definitely DO NOT RECOMMEND buying from this manufacture and go with a competitor's product that doesn't leak steam and make a mess on your countertop."},{"reviewerName":"Martha L.","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Age doesn't matter!","reviewDate":"August 24, 2019","reviewText":"75 years old and trying a new method was worth it.

Broke after 4 months of regular use.","reviewDate":"The manufacturer commented on the review below","reviewText":"What I liked:\nGreat air fryer for air frying lots of food at once. It does a good job crisping food if you have some experience with the process. For example, to best crisp wings and not have any burning, its important to first cook them in the oven and finishing to crisp them in the air fryer.\n\nWhat I don't like:\nWe've had the Cosori Air Fryer since mid-June ( 4 months) and the fryer basket that pulls out broke in End of October. It looks like the basket just cracked due to head damage. Now I'm trying to figure out how to reach Amazon to get a replacement basket (assuming they will make this process easy for me). I'm not sure if anyone else has had this issue but we are regular users of our air fryer. Since we bought it, we have probably used it twice a week (sometimes more).

We'll see when the electric bill comes in but i do believe it will be lower. It cooks the exact same as my oven but only faster.

The one thing that I found to be confusing, though, is that there are not simple instructions for how long to cook certain things. For instance, there is no basic information on how long and at what temp to cook chicken breasts. The pre-set button appears to be for thighs and bone-in portions of the chicken.

The ease of use and time to prepare meals is easy and the clean up afterwards is great. I used to eat a lot of grilled foods on a vented cook top so the flavor is not quite the same, however the health benefits are great as I have lost weight from eliminating the fats, and butters. I am still experimenting with new items and times with good results. Start at a known temp for an item and play with times, I start with short times and work up from there until I determine my desired level of being done.

My convection over can't even do as well. This fryer is working spectacularly. Definitely a recommend.

Do you want perfect wings, super crispy? Well this is what you need. I never knew everything you could make in this! If you want to make a salmon patty, here you go! This cooks it perfectly inside while giving it the brown crisp you need on the outside while at the same time not making it dry. Veggies, whole chickens, fish it does it all. The thing I think I like most about it, is reheating fried foods... Your chicken, fries or whatever is brought back to life. We get to go fries, refrigerate, and use the air fryer to bring it back to life. THEY TASTE BETTER THEN THEY DID WHEN THEY WERE FIRST BOUGHT! I kid u not. You have to see and taste it to believe it.

Stuff tastes fine, but looks bad. Very hard to get anything to come out evenly cooked or looking appetizing. As far as brands go, this one is fine, works well. Just takes up a lot of room for whats looking like very little use."},{"reviewerName":"Morgan Roberts","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Best decision I made... fast and easy for on the go moms","reviewDate":"July 18, 2019","reviewText":"This is the best purchase I have made.

I use this about 3 times a week to make dinner for my boyfriend and I and now I am getting requests by him to make the same dinners I’ve cooked in this... that’s a good sign!

I owned a few and even though the others had a larger capacity with horizontal cooking grates, this uses a basket which is removable and allowes you to separate from the plastic housing for cleaning, but also for draining extra fluids that have accumulated (frozen foods, etc) easy startup guide was actually easy, and the touch screen is responsive (didnt have to double tap anything). So far I have cooked wings in it and it does a GREAT job. I used some spray cooking oil for a little crisp and it did exactly that. I gave it 5 stars for everything because it really does perform.

It also cooks everything in less time than it would take in the oven. I seriously haven’t turned on my oven since we’ve bought this! So far we’ve made fried pickles, crispy tofu, french fries (frozen and fresh cut), baked potatoes, and my mom tried cooking burgers in it and said they came out absolutely perfect (crispy on the outside and juicy in the middle).

There is a steam vent located in the back, which can billow out quite a high volume if you are cooking food with too much oil or moisture in it.

I've had this now for a couple of weeks, and I use it nearly everyday. I've made falafel, fries, brussel sprouts - to name just a few. The most impressive feature is how you can make crispy veggies in less than 20 minutes, whereas previously I would cook veggies for over an hour at 425, I know can get better results at a fraction of the time.

It was hard to understand all the buttons and there are a few quirks to learn but the food tasted amazing, juicy and not dried out. The clean up is super easy, I put aluminum foil under the basket and its super easy clean up. The basket is large enough for a family of 2, and because the cook time is cut in half of a conventional oven you could prepare a meal for 4 in 2 batches. I tried to cook the French fries recipe and it came out overcooked because I cut them thin I think the recommended size was 1/2\" thick.

The only thing I do not like about this product is that the bottom of the food basket insert is easy to clean, but not the sides!

So after dusting chicken wings in a little baking powder and “frying” them I am thrilled with the results. They tasted like they were fried in oil, crispy perfection.

We use it pretty much every day.","reviewDate":"December 15, 2018","reviewText":"I held off writing my review for a while because I wanted to be able to give an accurate one for people to read.\nI have a newly discovered heart condition and need to watch (and change) what and how I eat. And so I wanted VERY much for all the hype about this air fryer to be true ..... but was afraid that they couldn't POSSIBLY be.\nWell, they ARE true !!\nI now cook almost EVERY meat item in our 5.8 qt Cosori Air Fryer. Probably 98% of it. (And what I DON'T cook in this fryer I usually cook in our Cosori 8-qt Multi-Cooker, particularly in the pressure cooker.) I haven't used our regular oven AT ALL for several months now.\nFood cooked in the Cosori Air Fryer comes out deliciously crispy on the outside but juicy on the inside.\nI pretty much prepare everything exactly as I did for oven cooking but now just spritz a little olive oil or Pam spray over the top before sliding the cooking basket in after it's short pre-heat.\nI now routinely cook chicken thighs and legs, fish and pork steaks in our air fryer. French fries are a once-a-month treat for us and they come out WONDERFULLY -- soft one the inside but crisp on the outside. (I can no longer really do many treat things these days.)\nThis Cosori also has a large-capacity basket, too, so there'll be less need to cook multiple batches. This basket will hold an entire regular-size package of Ore-Ida fries, 4 large chicken thigh, 6 large chicken legs or 2 large pork steaks at one time. I've had NO need to do multiple batches to feed both my son and myself.\nNOTHING comes out greasy, either, not even the fries. No greasy fingers. But everything still tastes delicious.\nAnd the cherry on top is the easy clean-up. Once the baskets have completely cooled off I swish some hot, soapy water around in them and then wipe them clean with a soapy sponge. Takes about 2 or 3 minutes. NOTHING sticks to either basket. Rinse them well and let them drip for a bit and then dry them off with a towel and then slide them back into the unit. Couldn't be easier. (And as I said, I've been using our air fryer pretty much DAILY for over 2 months now -- STILL nothing is sticking, not even a little bit.) Rinsing well takes the longest time, not the washing.\nThere is a nice little cookbook that comes with the Cosori Air Fryer, too. It has a BUNCH of recipes in it and special tips.\nI would heartily recommend that ANYONE who wants to cook in a more healthy manner but still have delicious food should buy this Cosori Air Fryer.\n(You might want to check out some YouTube videos of people cooking in THEIR air fryers, too. I found them very helpful.)"},{"reviewerName":"Tom Steele","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"This is one of the better Air Fryers out there!","reviewDate":"January 3, 2019","reviewText":"The COSORI 5.8 Qt Electric Hot Air Fryer Oven - oil-less cooker is one of the nicer air fryers on the market. We know, we have tried several. All of the air fryers we have tried worked pretty well, but the COSORI model has a couple of things that set it apart from the others.\n\nFirst, and most important to us, is the size. Even through many of them are listed as 5.8 Quarts, the COSORI model doesn't take up as much space on your counter-tops as others. And even through it is more compact than others, it still has nearly 6 quarts of cooking area.\n\nSecond, it comes with an attractive and USEFUL cookbook. Our first dinner included chicken and potatoes and there were tons of recipes to choose from. We made sliced baked potatoes and they tasted great. I would like them to be a little firmer and crispier, but my wife accidentally forgot to use the french fry setting, so I believe they may turn out better next time. They TASTED outstanding regardless.\n\nThird, this is an attractive model that is EASY-TO-USE. The layout and controls are very easy to use. We literally used it the same evening as we received the COSORI air fryer. It was that easy to get up and running and use the recipe book.\n\nFinally, the cooking basket is so easy to clean that it is almost self cleaning. All we had to do was wipe it our with a paper towel. We did not need to wash it or anything like that.\n\nYou may have some questions about how to unhook the fryer basket. I tried to post some photos that show how that works. You have to push the CLEAR PLASTIC COVER in towards the fryer, THEN press down on the black button. Don't do this over the floor or you will drop the basket. We kept thinking the clear plastic piece would open the basket. It doesn't. You have to push the clear cover in, THEN press the black button. It is simple, but if you don't know that you might end up like us - pressing the clear cover and trying to figure out why it isn't opening.\n\nWe love our new air fryer. I don't care so much that it is healthy. I just want my food to taste good and not be hard to clean. The Cosori Air Fryer does all of that and more! Great job Cosori!"},{"reviewerName":"Johnny","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Air fryer tips","reviewDate":"The manufacturer commented on the review below","reviewText":"This is our second air fryer and we have become fast learners. First, even if your family is small, get the largest capacity model you can find. And be sure that its cooking tray is a squarish shape and not round. This sleek one from Cosori is indeed one of the largest at 5.8 qt. But forget about that number since the real cooking area is what is important. For this one, you’ve got a nice large 9 x 9” area that can fit 10 chicken drumsticks and most of a bag of frozen fries.\n\nSpeaking of fries, we love the results and have found that the store brand thin shoestring type works best. Terrific results. Also great are chicken tenders, frozen meatballs and wings.\n\nThe Consori differs from several other models by virtue of the large number of presets for various types of foods. These are impressive yet I prefer to set a high temp for crispiness and, as needed for all air fryers, stir and flip the food occasionally for even air frying. Its 1700 watts is another key feature. Higher wattage is indeed better. Lastly, it’s two year warranty is longer than most competing brands. Worth it for piece of mind, although for other competing models, extended warranties sold by Amazon are inexpensive."},{"reviewerName":"Typical Consumer","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Ceramic heating element spontaneously disintegrated the second time it was used.","reviewDate":"The manufacturer commented on the review below","reviewText":"Ceramic heating element spontaneously disintegrated the second time it was used. Wasn’t reliable"},{"reviewerName":"Michael Demeritt","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"got a lot of E1 errors until we stumbled across the answer","reviewDate":"February 3, 2019","reviewText":"This AirFryer has a nice 5.8 qtr basket, a grated basket that allows for superior browning on the underside of foods (though tossing or turning is still recommended). It comes with a plethora of presets - we still just set the temp and time ourselves mostly, and rarely use the presets. Its pretty quiet and allows for more running time than smaller Air-Fyrers. This one would be the \"medium\" sized fryer, for lack of better comparison, holding significantly more than the small ones, a deeper basket, but not as big as the ones with built in rotisseries that allow you to air fry small chickens or lamb for gyros. But it is plenty big for most people.\n\nThe basket has a safety latch that allows it to separate from the surrounding mount, with a plastic thumb guard to limit the chance it will come undone unintentionally. This mechanism takes a little getting used to, but it does allow for slightly easier cleaning of the basket. Unfortunately, there is more internal \"splatter\" than you get in a smaller fryer, requiring more care in cleaning the fryer itself. Still, this is a minor inconvenience.\n\nThe buttons for temp/time are not intuitive and there is a \"play/pause\" button to start or pause it midway through the cooking time on the fryer which is confusing until you get used to it -- it looks like it is meant for an audio device. There is a nice preheat feature, lacking on many air fryers, that makes for more even cooking.\n\nWe did get \"E-1\" errors almost every time we used the device at first, causing it to shut down and beep alarmingly. There was nothing in the guidebook that explained what this meant, but an online search revealed this is a code for a short in the temperature sensor and for a while we though we had a dud of a fryer, but my wife noticed we plugged the fryer into a multi-plug/charger product we have in the kitchen (the kind that makes a two outlet plug into six outlets and also has USB charger ports). Despite the fact the device is grounded and has a breaker of its own, when we directly plugged the fryer into an outlet the problem went away. So if you are getting \"E-1\" alerts, check for that weird quirk."},{"reviewerName":"Dspecfla","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great Customer Service- THE reason for 5 stars.","reviewDate":"October 24, 2019","reviewText":"I received a Cosori CP-258-AF as a gift about a month ago.

We have used the replacement for about 2 weeks now without any problems. I wish all Customer services were as pleasant to work with. I didnt even have to send the defective product back!

The 5.8 quart size is just right to take the place of a regular oven for my family (me, my wife and our 11 year old daughter). It cooks up salmon fillets quickly. A game hen fits nicely inside. Mini-pizzas come out very well (just make a regular pizza dough and divide it into thirds before letting it rise). It is easy to clean. Frozen foods (nuggets, fish stick, shrimp …) do well in this. French frys turn out fine (crispy baked more than deep fried and don't forget to turn them half way through). I need to work on baked mushrooms some more.\nThis fryer is just the right size for us. But if our family was much larger, it would require more than one rotation of cooking - thus making the conventional oven more useful and the air fryer just for side dishes.\nIt is easy to clean with a very durable nonstick surface. I have not had it longer enough to say anything about the long term quality of the machine.\nOverall the fryer is right for us, but you may want something larger or smaller to fit your needs."},{"reviewerName":"jeremyh8","rating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Died on first cook","reviewDate":"The manufacturer commented on the review below","reviewText":"UPDATE: support did replace my defective unit and did not require i send the old one back.

In general, I'd give this thing (and did give it) high marks for being easy to use. The touchscreen interface is really easy to use with the icons that are shown on it very simple to understand.\n\nThe process of preheating is also really simple and preheating is highly recommended and important to the process of using this device. That does raise a concern though in that because you are supposed to preheat the device it means the pan/tray/drawer is typically going to be hot when you are loading your food into it. I can see where someone may easily burn themselves if they aren't careful, and I'm sure that there are cautions in the documentation, but I'll take a moment here to remind people to be careful when loading the food content into the tray. Burning yourself isn't fun and of course takes time away from being able to enjoy the cooking you would be doing.\n\nCleaning is an area that I had to downgrade a bit. It does clean fairly easily and the tray pieces (the basket and main pan) are noted in the documentation (see, I did read more than a little of it) as being able to go into a dishwasher, though with the large unit (5.8 Qt) the parts are a bit big and will use a lot of space in the dishwasher if you go that route. If you wash by hand the internal basket/tray has vent slots on the side and the open area at the bottom of the tray that is used to help force the air through and do the actual pan frying. Those vent slots and the grate at the bottom of the tray/pan are going to be a bit annoying to clean. It'll scrub up easily enough, but may snag the nylon sponge or pad type material you may want to use on this. Just be ready for a little frustration in that area.\n\nOn to use and taste - use is a little bit of a mixed bag in that the food items that I thought of trying first will work fairly well but at the same time take a little bit of detective work to hit the right device usage on. For example, I wanted to cook up some frozen cheese sticks. I knew the instructions from the box those cheese sticks came in, but with this air fryer, I figured that I would check out the recipes that are online. They are numerous recipes at the manufacturer's website, including one for homemade cheese sticks that spend a little time in the freezer before they are cooked. The cheese sticks that I had were frozen solid. Should I use the \"frozen\" button or should I adjust things a bit to get the cook time closer to what is on the box? Using the frozen button worked fairly well, though I cheated a bit by using the \"keep warm\" button at the end of the cycle while I was heating up the marinara sauce that came with the box of cheese sticks. In the end the cheese sticks were cooked nicely and were fairly warm so they were OK to my taste testing.\n\nMrs. Terpfan1980 was out during my initial testing, getting home just in time to find me eating the 3rd or 4th cheese stick from the package. She isn't a fan of cheese sticks (and even if she was, she is a bit intolerant of cheese so it wouldn't be advisable for her to try them) or marinara so she passed on helping to test those. I had some frozen french fries though and was looking forward to testing them (I forgot to heat up the gravy that I was going to dip them in though).\n\nMuch like the cheese sticks, I was left a little perplexed as to which of the available presets I should use for the fries. These weren't thawed or freshly cut potatoes, but frozen fries. Should I use the preset for frozen? or the one for fries? In the end, we went with the frozen preset. As it required shaking, we monitored at the halfway point and then again at the end and determined that it was going to be best to go through the same program for a second pass.\n\nThe fries came out OK, but not as tasty as they would be if they were cooked in vegetable oil on the stove. They'd make more mess that way and not be as good for us to consume (not that they are good to consume anyway, but they are less \"bad for you\" if you eat them air fried vs. fried in oil). If I had cooked up/heated up the jar of gravy and then dipped the fries in that, I'd probably have been happier. Mrs. Terpfan1980 isn't a fan of gravy, so she would have passed on that option. She and I were both left thinking the final product was OK but could have been better if cooked differently (such as frying on the stove).\n\nMrs. Terpfan1980 is looking forward to trying sweet potato fries or sweet potato tater tots. Me, on the other hand, would like plain tater tots to test with.\n\nI would caution that this thing does take up a good sized footprint and counter space. It offers a decent amount of cooking space in the basket that is included. The manufacturer's website offers up a lot of recipes that can be tried or used as models for what presets and settings to use for your own cooking.\n\nIn the end, for me this is a solid 4 star device with the caution that users need to be careful not to burn themselves on the basket/pan. It also requires leaving space available all around the device. In other words, don't plan on stacking on top of it, or putting it too close to other items. You don't want to find that the plastic container that was sitting right next to it on the counter has warped or melted or that you've started a fire by leaving something too close to the areas that need ventilation. Follow the instructions and included safety information for your own best results. (Yes, reading instructions can be important. They exist for good reasons and should be reviewed before use!)"},{"reviewerName":"Texas Sandra Dee","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Look at these fries, look at these fries!","reviewDate":"July 11, 2019","reviewText":"I had never even heard of an air fryer before last week.

Don't those make you hungry?? All I did was toss the raw fries in about 1 TBSP oil and a bit of salt and pepper. There was no mess to clean up, no oil to dispose of. I was impressed. The food does not taste quite like food fried in quantities of oil. It tastes lighter and not as greasy. I can't wait to try more recipes I read in the very well illustrated included cookbook. The clean up on this unit was ridiculously easy. Everything wiped up to a brand new state. There is a rack and some skewers included.

It's just not as great as I thought it would be. One thing I did learn... the drawer had to be engaged in the fryer in order for it to do anything. The minute you pull the drawer out, the power completely shuts off. I found the control panel hard to use. To set cook time and temperature you push the buttons, but there is a slight delay in response time and so you push more and go beyond where you wanted to be. The machine needs to be preheated, so you set the temperature and time, and then once it's done it shuts off so in order to cook your food you have to go through and reprogram it all over. Just doesn't seem logical to me.\n\nMy picture is of fried pickles, and they were really yummy. Very crunchy.\n\nThis fryer also requires a lot of power when it's running.

Airfryer is my new chef.","reviewDate":"July 15, 2019","reviewText":" I've always wanted an airfryer, but the ones I've seen in stores just felt janky. My fiance therefor banned me from buying one, but my longing for one has always remained... Finally I got my hands on this Cosori and it is everything I dreamed and more! For one it looks like an fancy car - matte white with clean black lines, square in shape. Everything on the outside looks and feels modern and premium. Touch buttons work great, putting the drawer out of the fryer feels premium and nothing feels flimsy. For someone who never used one, it came with great descriptions on the box, packaged really well, and with a cookbook. Now the other reviews raved about the cookbook and dang, it did live up to the hype! Looking through it just gets you excited to give it a go!\n\nSo once all the plastic was out (double check that you removed it all!!!) I put it on my counter, and yes it is quite large. It will have to live on TOP of the counter. And when I use it, I'll have to pull it farther out so that the steam vent in the back isn't under any cabinetry. When I used it though, It didn't create any crazy amount of steam, and it wasn't louder than my hair dryer! It only turns on when the basket is correctly placed inside which is a great safety feature. Just hit power, then hit PRE-HEAT then the play/pause button to get it warmed up in 5. I made some costco panko shrimp for my first try, using the \"professional convection oven\" instructions on the box, and checking 6 minutes in (out of 14), it was already SIZZLING and brown! I left it in the whole 14 and it was lightly burnt, but still totally yummy. I realized I made a mistake and should've followed the house-hold convection oven setting but it was still AMAZING.\n\nThe facebook community for this airfryer is AMAZING, they post daily photos of what they've made, share recipes, and Cosori themselves chime in to answer questions frequently. Everyone seems very positive and supportive - a great resource!\n\nThe capacity is smaller than an oven yes, but for me and my fiance, it's perfect to use this and not heat up the house with the oven, nor have to wait for an oven to pre-heat and cook. We heated up perfectly crispy panko shrimp in a shorter amount of time than my over would've preheated! I even heard you can make 7\" pizzas or 7\" cakes. Perfect for a single person or couple, great for a quick crispy snack!

Might have needed to add a touch more oil for the fries, or maybe a slightly longer cook time... (i went with the air fryer instructions on the bag..) but over all it did very well. Wonderful addition to our kitchen tools and I will have to find room for it to live at the ready in my pantry.\n\n*edit* we did bacon the next morning on the bacon setting.. and, seriously, the best bacon.

This interest me because my fiancé likes fried food such as fries and fired chicken, but I choose a healthy lifestyle and don’t like the grease in fried food or the cleanup mess. I choose Cosari for two reasons: 1) I read reviews stating they are rated as as the number 1 air fryer (still skeptical because it depends on who writes the review 2) I wanted a larger cooking capacity and this was one of the largest I could find.\n\nI immediately made crispy homemade potatoes and everyone loved them, especially my fiancée who won’t eat potatoes unless they are crisp. Next, I made bacon and was impressed that I didn’t need to babysit the bacon the same way I would if I cooked on my stovetop. Best of all the bacon was crisp and no grease splatter to cleanup. Next I made the Mongolian chicken wings recipe I found in the recipe book I received and those were a hit. Today, I made fried chicken and was also very happy with the crispness of the chicken.. cleanup is a breeze and the air fryer is easy to use."},{"reviewerName":"bekki","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Large capacity!","reviewDate":"January 14, 2019","reviewText":"I had an air fryer before but rarely used it because of the fairly small capacity...it held enough for dinner, but not really enough to justify dragging it out of the cabinet and dealing with it, so there it sat. Plus, the rounded container made it seem even smaller than it was for a lot of things I wanted to cook in it. I kept seeing pictures and recipes all over the internet using air fryers, so when I saw the capacity for the Cosori, I was intrigued enough to give them one more shot and I'm so glad I did.\n\nAs you can see, the Cosori really doesn't take up much more space than my old one, despite having so much more room. It may not look like it from the photos, but it's a generous 2-3 servings more. Since I cook with leftovers in mind, this is really is the difference between gathering dust and being an essential daily tool.\n\nSo far I haven't gotten really creative with my cooker because I'm concerned with the basics. Things like roasted potatoes, potato wedges, and veggies are going to be the staples for me and the air fryer shines for them. Potato cooking times are only cut down by about 10-15 minutes, but roasted veggies come out in about 12 minutes (instead of 30-40) and are perfect. I definitely see me using this to prepare healthy sides instead of junk food even when I'm pressed for time.\n\nThe controls are a little weird until you get the hang of them; turning on the machine is a 3 step process and not necessarily intuitive. You hit the power button, then the setting THEN the start button. Not a big deal, but at least worth a read through of the instructions. The presets are something else that really makes this easier for me. My last air fryer just had a timer and a temp and honestly, I had no idea what to do...I could have researched, but really who wants to do that to cook some cauliflower? Having a handy picture guide at least gives some direction for a starting point.\n\nThe only big warning I have is not to wait for the shake alarm. While it's very handy, I have found that for more even cooking halfway through just doesn't do it.

Riccitello","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Awesome!!!","reviewDate":"October 11, 2019","reviewText":"I read alot of reviews and took alot of time before deciding which air fryer to buy. I decided on this one, I read the reviews of people complaining about the basket chipping off the non stick coating, I personally do not have that issue (ive had mine about 1 month). I have not put it in dishwasher I wash it out after every use, not sure if maybe that is the issue with everyone else. The basket drawer itself is very hard to open at first, well after several times. Its still alittle hard opening but Ive gotten use to so it doe snot bother me. I have done bacon, pizza, nuggets, fries, everything comes out amazing, my kids like using it. They will do bagel bites after school, it literally takes about 4-5 min and its done perfectly and crispy. The only issue Ive noticed ( I havent tried all preset buttons) but the fry pre set button i noticed if you dont have a full basket of fries, the preset time is to much, they will burn. So i use it anyway just take them out in half the time. I love it, very glad I bought it."},{"reviewerName":"Courtney","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"I should've bought this a long time ago!","reviewDate":"August 26, 2019","reviewText":"Oh. My. God. This thing is amazing! My old fryer consisted of a pot on my stove with oil in it... so that was a hassle! This thing can make nearly anything, it cooks quick and perfect and easy to clean up! And the food tastes amazing! Better than my \"fryer\". I love johnsonville sausage, but it's such a pain to cook so I rarely make it. Well, now I just throw them in here (360F/12-15 min) rotate them once, and they're cooked perfectly, made the outside a nice, even crispiness. The wings come out soooo good! Nice, crispy texture. I also made teriyaki chicken skewers, which i never made before, only tried it because of this fryer. I overcooked the first time, but it was still good. Second time was perfect, juicy, with a little crisp. There is a recipe book which can give you great ideas. It's easy to clean, especially if you put a piece of aluminum foil in the fry pan (NOT the basket). Don't hesitate.. just buy one already. I regret waiting so long, seriously."},{"reviewerName":"Timothy","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Hands down BEST customer service I've EVER dealt with","reviewDate":"September 29, 2019","reviewText":"Buy this Air Fryer for the customer service! The product is great, but I think we all know that great products are made even better when you deal with excellent customer service. I had a minor issue with my Air Fryer and they sent me a brand new one, no questions asked. All I had to do was take some pictures and email them. It was quick and painless. They have followed-up to make sure the new one is working great, and took a genuine interested in what I've cooked in it so far. Every email has been custom to my needs and I've just felt so loved by this company. Like I said, hands down BEST customer service experience EVER. This Air Fryer works great and if you're on the fence about size I recommend going bigger if you're cooking for more than one person. Clean-up is such a breeze. I bet I've cut my dirty dishes in half by using this air fryer. It's super easy to clean and worth every penny. The product quality is great and top notch. It comes with a few manuals that have recipes and quick cooking instructions.

You may or may not find it useful.","reviewDate":"January 19, 2019","reviewText":"After having this fryer for a couple weeks, my wife is ambivalent about it. She says its benefit to you as a cook depends on whether you already have a convection oven in your cooking arsenal. If you don’t, then you might find this gadget useful. If you have convection capabilities, though, you probably won’t find much difference in the results between it and this air fryer.\n\nSo far, she’s made three things with this fryer. The first were onion rings working from no recipe at all. Those tasted okay but didn’t look like onion rings. That prompted her to try the recipes that come with the fryer. (Which are generally well-written and easy-to-follow.)\n\nThe next thing she tried were French fries. They came out looking like they should and tasted fine, but they were a little on the dry side. Also, they took a full half hour to make. (Would’ve been quicker in the oven.)\n\nThe third thing she tried were blueberry scones. Those turned out wonderfully. Even in consistency, not flakey or too moist. And great tasting! Not overly sweet. Might be the best scones I’ve ever had. That said, she thinks the same results could be had in a convection oven, in a similar amount of time. (Around 15 minutes.)\n\nAll in all, a solid fryer at a reasonable price. We probably won’t use it much given we have a convection oven, but your results may vary."},{"reviewerName":"Pam Leonard","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Basket won't release","reviewDate":"March 9, 2019","reviewText":"I am already very upset because when I push the release button to release the inner Basket from the outer basket it won't release.

Not because the product is bad, but because I adore this air fryer so much that I wanted to test out everything before posting.\n\nWhen I first got the air fryer it took forever to unpackage everything, take off all the protective plastic, and read the instructions. Yes, I took the time to read every bit of instructions that came with the fryer, and you should too if you purchase it. I learned a lot about the product just by reading the pamphlet.\n\nAfter getting everything out of the fryer and getting it set up in the only free spot on my counter, I dug out an eggplant to fry. I had been expecting the air fryer, so when I went shopping I grabbed some things to fry. I don't recommend doing eggplant as one would usually fry eggplant (flour and buttermilk), it tasted mostly like flour. I do recommend using the air fryer to fry hot dogs!\n\nChicken is also a fantastic option for frying in this fryer. I'm still experimenting with what veggies come out tasting the best, but it does come with a very detailed cookbook. I used a recipe from the cookbook when I made chicken in it recently and it was amazing. I'm looking forward to getting more ingredients to use the cookbook more often.\n\nThe buttons are simple to figure out, I use the \"bacon\" button for hot dogs. There are different buttons for veggies and root veggies - which makes you google if eggplant is a root veggie (it's not). At first, the number of buttons can be overwhelming but I just kept the manual on hand for the first week.\n\nWhen I was learning to fry foods and the ripe old age of 9, I got badly burnt from a mistake my brother made. I have been terrified of frying ever since (I'm now 27). My family has learned to live without fried food and it doesn't agree with my stomach anyway. That being said, I love this healthy alternative and tell everyone about it!"},{"reviewerName":"Allen","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"One of the best","reviewDate":"July 31, 2019","reviewText":"Most air fryers come with a handy dandy cookbook and recipes (as does this one) which for me doesn’t provide much value. I’m the type that likes to cook but “feel” than by step by step instructions. Many of the foods I cook today in a convection oven, I’ve gone through a learning process to get the optimal doneness. So that being said, the shortcut buttons (like you find on a microwave) works well enough. It sets the temp and time so you can leave it in and walk away. But my usage preference is to set the temperature manually myself. One of the features I’m most happy about is the digital display. It makes the fryer look more modern and tells you exactly what temperature you’re cooking at. It even has a shake-the-basket reminder. From other brands, all you usually get is a dial to manage the timer and temperature. That makes it difficult for users to see what temperature they’re cooking at. There’s also a preheat and keep warm function which honestly makes this air fryer one tier above the rest. Additionally, there’s a little cooking tray that’s a necessity for cooking any meat. That way the oil can drip to the bottom leaving you just the meat with all the flavors encompassed inside. But if you’re air frying vegetables, you can usually do it without the tray.\n\nHonestly I found air frying works for just about anything versus a counter top convection oven…EXCEPT frozen pizza. They don’t fit. So if you eat a lot of frozen pizzas and don’t have an alternative way to heat those up, an air fryer is not a direct replacement for that. But for cooking and reheating, the air fryer makes a compelling argument in terms of fast and even cooking.\n\nPros:\n- Cooks faster than a convection oven\n- Large size for making dishes for a family of 4\n- Dishwasher safe tray and basket\n- Digital display with preheat and keep warm functions\n- Shortcuts buttons for cooking meat, fish, and vegetables\n\nCons:\n- Does take up a bit of counter space\n- 1700 watts, ensure your outlet can handle this"},{"reviewerName":"Fbx_Steve","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Everything you think it will be!","reviewDate":"August 8, 2019","reviewText":"We love this air fryer. It's very easy to use. You can be an expert air frying chef after less than 5 minutes of reading the instructions. So far, we have made sweet potato fries and fried zucchini. Both turned out good, but we learned a couple of lessons that made the subsequent batches of those pretty close to perfect. Make sure you get a thin, even coating of oil on whatever you are frying. Putting the olive oil in a spray bottle solved the problem. Especially for thins such as the zucchini, which we sliced thinly and dipped in ranch dressing to eat, it is also important to make sure they all get turned over at the halfway point of cooking. For the sweet potato fries, it was fine just shaking them like you might do in a regular deep fryer. But the zucchini (and regular potato chips, if you made those) are really better if every one is turned over mid-way through.\n\nThe fryer is easy to clean; just wash the detachable basket and pan in soap and water. It cooks a lot quicker than I thought it would. I was convinced that the automatic times you get when use one of the one-button cook cycles would be too short, but they weren't. The only drawbacks, if you can call them that, is that the fryer is larger and heavier than we thought it would be. Most people should be able to lift it with 2 hands--it's not THAT heavy. It's just that sensation of \"wow-that's a bit solid\" you get when you first pick it up. If you want to leave it out all the time, be aware that it will occupy a good deal of counter space. We chose to put our away between uses."},{"reviewerName":"Terry","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Probably my favorite air fryer so far","reviewDate":"January 7, 2019","reviewText":"I've been using air fryers for a couple of years now and seriously, this COSORI 5.8 Qt Air Fryer is probably my favorite so far. I like it even better than my much more expensive Philips air fryers for a few reasons.\n\nFirst off, this is a big fryer. 5.8 Qt. This is great for me because I have a large family but they also have a 3.7 Qt air fryer that is presumably smaller and would make enough food for one to three people.\n\nIt has a thick plastic casing that has a brushed finish. It's not as pretty initially as the glossy plastic Philips but it shows fingerprints and grease way less. This one has digital controls with a touch screen. I also love this because it's so easy to just wipe clean and no knobs to collect dust and grease.\n\nAir fryers are just small convection ovens. They cook faster and brown better because the hot air is blown around the food via a fan. Anything you can make in a conventional oven, you can make in an air fryer. You just have to modify the temperature and cooking time. A general rule of thumb is to set the temp 25 F lower and decrease the cooking time about 20% but you may have to make minor adjustments from there. If you are baking in an air fryer, you will need a baking vessel that will fit inside the basket. Cosori sells a nice set of baking and cooking accessories: https://www.amazon.com/Cosori-Fryer-Accessories-C158-6AC-Brands/dp/B07J5SDNMY/\n\nSo the air fryer has a slide out drawer with a basket that fits inside. The drawer and the basket has a non-stick coating and is even dishwasher safe, although I hand wash to preserve the non-stick coating. The food goes into the basket which sits elevated in the drawer so hot air circulates around the food on all sides. It's a simple and effective way to cook foods evenly.\n\nSo while you can cook anything in an air fryer, my family uses it mostly for frozen foods that just don't come out brown and crispy in the microwave. Things like frozen french fries, chicken tenders, pot stickers, fish planks, steak fingers, taquitos, egg rolls, etc. We also love making grilled cheese sandwiches in the air fryer. It's even better than cooking them on the griddle. Since I have adult kids who work odd hours, this fryer stays out on the counter all the time so they can cook for themselves when they get home. My daughter in law uses hers almost every night to make dinner for her and my son because it's faster and less clean up.\n\nYou can achieve crispiness by spraying lightly with cooking spray or an oil mister filled with olive oil. You will definitely need this for many of the foods you cook.\n\nAnother key tip is to shake or turn many foods during the cooking process. Small foods like french fries, egg rolls, chicken tenders, etc, require shaking a few times during cooking to make sure each piece is evenly browned and crispy. It's very easy to do and this Cosori air fryer even has a \"shake\" reminder built in if you use some of the presets!\n\nOne other thing we love to make is chicken wings and drummies and roasted vegetables. Very easy and they cook beautifully. This fryer comes with a nice recipe book to get you started and there are Facebook groups and websites that have hundreds of recipes and tips for making the most of your air fryer. (Try the Hasselback Potatoes recipe in the included book. They are delicious and make a lovely presentation.)\n\nIf it sounds like I am sold on air fryers, I am. I am a lackluster cook at best and this has been a huge boon to me. It's quick and doesn't heat up the kitchen and the clean up is much easier than with a conventional oven. Even my husband will make food in an air fryer!"},{"reviewerName":"Michelle L. Beck","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Healthier, no mess and easy clean up.","reviewDate":"January 10, 2019","reviewText":"My husband and I enjoy trying out new kitchen gadgets, and this is no exception. Recently we got an InstantPot and we love that, so the next logical step was getting an air fryer. So when offered, I ordered and received the Cosori Air Fryer, and it is a great addition to our household. The Cosori is aesthetically beautiful so you could leave it on the counter but it is rather large and will take up significant space. I decided to store mine and just get it out whenever I need it. The Cosori is easy to set up. It is a good size (5.8 quarts) and can hold a decent amount of food in a large basket. The nonstick basket sits in a removable drawer that is easy to clean. Another bonus is that this fryer comes with a cookbook that contains 100 recipes, and there are tons of recipes on the internet. Right out of the box (and after cleaning), I was able to cook several pieces of fish. There are easy to follow instructions/pictures on the digital display located on the front of the appliance. Simply select the item that you are cooking (i.e., fish, steak, veggies, potatoes, etc.), the temperature (up to 400 degrees) and the time. Initially, I used only an egg wash, seasoning and breadcrumbs, before placing it in the basket - with no oil. But I found that adding a little cooking spray on the basket worked best and made it crispy. I also made a piece that I simply brushed a little olive oil on the fish before adding my seasoning and breadcrumbs and that worked as well. So eventually it looked how a lightly sautéed dish would look. I like that it mimics the feel and taste of being fried while being healthier and easier to clean. My old school fryer is always a pain to clean (discarding all of the used oil) and deal with (I hate oil when it pops). So after cooking that fish, I didn’t have much of a fishy smell in the house like I do with traditional frying on the stove or in the deep fryer, and I didn’t have the messy clean-up. All I had to do was once cooled, wipe out the tray with a napkin and wash. NO mess and easy to clean. In conclusion, I am definitely planning to have a lot of fun getting to know my air fryer. I just think the trick is figuring out how to get a good sear or crunch on whatever you are cooking. I plan to have fun experimenting."},{"reviewerName":"lostcarolina","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Cooks fries better than oven baked","reviewDate":"July 24, 2019","reviewText":"Preheats to 400 degrees in 5 minutes which is my favorite feature. On several occasions I have taken chicken drumettes straight out of the freezer and put them in, seasoned and they were perfectly done and all I did was push the chicken button on the panel. There is a bacon button as well. I run 1 cycle for bacon that's on the softer side and 2 cycles for crispy bacon. I have found this to be an extreme time saver when I'm cooking dinner for a family of 5. I can put something in the fryer and literally forget about it while I'm stovetop cooking sides. I did try out the broccoli button but wasn't impressed with it but how that is cooked is personal preference. It comes with a wire rack that you can use to add extra crispiness to your food which i do use quite often. Now, most want to know how this compares to stovetop for FRENCH FRIES which is what I was most excited to try. I can say this air fryer does way better than oven baking fries but still not as good as stove top.

But oh, the calories and the oil! Not so good for you. This Cosori Air Fryer gives you the crispiness and taste of fried food with much less oil and calories, for a healthier meal. We have a small deep fryer, that we use sparingly, not only because its not the healthiest option, but also because it consumes a lot of oil and you have more cleaning and disposal of the oil to deal with. More hassle. But this Air Fryer is like a mini convection oven that circulates hot air through and around a basket of food enclosed inside, to give an efficient way to heat the food quickly and evenly.\n\nWe bought some frozen french fries that had oil already brushed on them, and they came out delicious. If you are making fresh cut french fries, a light coating of oil will give the crispiness, or no oil will give you a more oven-baked texture, but a little crisp. We also ate delicious chicken drumsticks brushed with oil and seasoned with paprika and salt. It's very easy to operate and simple to clean the basket. A good, healthier alternative.\n\nIt's also very clean and sleek in design, with simple controls and it doesn't look like a cheap appliance--it's really well made."},{"reviewerName":"Kathryn","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Works very well, the drawer is a little difficult to slide in properly","reviewDate":"The manufacturer commented on the review below","reviewText":"I have owned one other model of air fryers - an XXL one of similar design by another manufacturer. Compared to the XXL one, this one has a more square design and holds even more potato wedges in a single layer - which is helpful because I generally cook veggies in a single layer because I think they cook more evenly that way and I don't have to shake them. This one has a pre-heat feature which is silent (no fans going). This air fryer is lighter weight but quieter while cooking. This one heats to a max of 400 while the old one heats to a max of 390. I do a lot of air frying (i.e. convection roasting) of vegetables without oil and I generally air fry them for 20 minutes at 390 in my other air fryer. This one will cook them equivalently in 15 minutes at 400 without pre-heating.

You can change the temp and time the same way as on certain microwaves, tapping the corresponding button until it flashes from ether the time or temp. A note about that is that you just have to wait a few seconds for it to stop flashing. Pressing the play icon will stop it but its easy enough to get use to.

Simple things like onion rings, french fries, or any other item you would generally deep fry or just put in the oven from the grocery store come out perfectly. We have even cooked things like ground chicken parmesan patties and I much prefer them from the fryer now than skillet frying them in oil.\n\nThings to note - I do this with all my cooking and baking, but I don't generally fully follow preset instructions. To get that perfect crust, sear, crispiness, fluffiness, etc... I always follow my own cooking intuition and timing, but nevertheless, this has been a great tool to work with.

We have cooked everything from veggies and chickpeas to chicken with incredible ease.\n\nThis unit is ideal size for our family of four."},{"reviewerName":"Lisa M","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Quick and easy","reviewDate":"January 18, 2019","reviewText":"An air fryer is the appliance I never thought I needed until I used one. This is my first experience with one and wasn't sure what to expect. It has been exciting trying out some of the easy recipes in the included book. This book is loaded with great air fryer recipes including everything from appetizers to desserts. Most appliances don't come with a recipe book, let alone one with around 100 ideas, so this is a huge bonus for me as it is my first attempt at these dishes. Even frozen foods come out perfect. I even attempted grilled cheese and was amazed! It is so easy to use with the touch screen controls and presets for select foods and the basket can be easily removed for cleaning. I love my Cosori air fryer and have been telling everyone I know about it."},{"reviewerName":"Corrin","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Faster than the oven","reviewDate":"August 24, 2019","reviewText":"So I’m still getting used to the air fryer. When I thought of an air fryer I thought it was just like an oil fryer and it would make the perfect French fry. So far that isn’t the case.\nI feel the air fryer is much more like a mini oven. It heats up in 5 min compared to 20 min with an oven. Plus it doesn’t make your house hot. I’ve made a variety of items from steak, salmon, veggies, sweet potatoes and russet potatoes and everything comes out yummy. The fries are not crispy like an oil fryer but more baked.\nClean up is a breeze. It’s not stick so I don’t even bother putting it into the dish washer. I just wipe the residue off and wash easily.\nI can’t wait to find more recipes."},{"reviewerName":"D. A.

This 5.8 Qt has all the power and ease you would expect, but with a capacity that means it doesn't take an hour to prepare a meal.\nEven though the basket is twice as large as our old model, the machine is only about 1/3 larger - so it doesn't take up a significant amount of additional space.\nIt works just as efficiently as previous air fryers we have owned. The controls are easy to read and intuitive to use. I haven't used the recipe book and probably won't. So far I really like it. We have used it a few times and have been satisfied."},{"reviewerName":"givpilot","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Really Happy!","reviewDate":"February 23, 2019","reviewText":"This is the third air fryer we've tried and it is far superior to the previous. It's easier to use, easier to clean and the food comes out crispier. So far we've cooked chicken wings, jalapeno poppers, breaded shrimp, fries and battered fish -- everything has turned out great. Not only is it easier to use and clean than our previous air fryers the food (so far!) has never come out soggy, it's always crispy, like you'd expect at a sports bar/grill. Very pleased! Haven't really gotten into the recipe book too far, but looking forward to expanding our use. I'm sure it will get old hat at some point, but it's made the kitchen fun again. :)"},{"reviewerName":"GAPeach","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"COSORI Air Fryer has me cooking again daily!","reviewDate":"August 9, 2019","reviewText":"After 3 rotator cuff surgeries in the past year and a half I had not been able to cook for myself. I had gained lots of weight from eating frozen foods and inactivity. I decided to find a way to cook healthy food fast, healthy, easy. I began looking into Air fryers and researched many brands. Corsori came up on several lists as a number one pick, so I decided to go for it.\n\nSince the Corsori air fryer arrived at my front door I have used it everyday. The picture is my first cook with the air fryer-- chicken wings. I have since cooked steak, fresh chicken fingers, stuffed clams, fish fillets, roasted brussel sprouts, roasted root vegetables and more. I have been able to create meals that are delicious and low carb. It does not create heat in the kitchen and clean up is a breeze. I look forward to cooking now and I am constantly thinking of new food to try in the Corsori.\n\nBuying the Corsori air fryer has been the best decision I have made for my health. I chose the 5.8qt the basket size is ample to cook lots of food at once. I like the square body and do not feel like the larger size 5.8qt takes up a lot more space than a smaller round air fryer brands.\n\nI would highly recommend this Corsori 5.8qt Air Fryer to anyone that is on the fence about buying one. It is a great kitchen tool that is easy and quick to get food on the table after a long workday.\n\nThank you Corsori you have changed my life!!"},{"reviewerName":"EDUARDO","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great air frier but wrong Color sent it (they sent me the wrong color and I couldn’t change them)","reviewDate":"The manufacturer commented on the review below","reviewText":"It is a wonderful air frier, really amazing, easy to use, great flavor, etc. I am giving only one star due to I bought 2 black ones and they sent me 2 white ones.

I've owned this air fryer for a month now & use it every day. From breakfast to dinner to baking. Love the size of the basket, which is larger enough to cook breakfast for 3 people (depending on the food you choose). The preset buttons are time saving, but must play with it as everyone likes their food a bit different; hence: eggs & veggies\nEasy to clean, but adding foil paper as a liner in the basket makes it even easier. The safety clear button is a good idea, but the way that it's made I feel that with time it will break & it can be a bit uncomfortable for females that have long nails (not a deal breaker). I was disappointed on the quality of the recipe book, as the pages on mine fell apart as I would flipped through them (again not a deal breaker). For those customers that complained that the recipe book didn't include baking recipes, stop being petty & utilize Google search 🤷🏽‍♀️\nSome of the foods I've cooked so far: egg Frittata, fried egg, bacon, cornbread, upside down pineapple cake, asparagus w/parmesan cheese, zucchini, empanadas, sausage, shrimp, burgers, chicken wings, chicken tenders."},{"reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Game Changer!!!","reviewDate":"June 16, 2019","reviewText":"This product is a game changer in the kitchen.

Shake, auto-off, and pause features are very useful; loving the presets, as well as, the \"preheat\" feature. 3.7Qt. its the perfect size, not too small, not too big.

I was concerned about its size but it turned out fine, see attached photo. Definitely easy to clean, I line drawer with foil per manual suggestion and just take apart top basket to dishwasher. Temp wise the max is 400F which it's fine because the fryer is smaller than normal stovetop ovens. As for easy to use, the buttons could be a little bit better but maybe I'm just used to my instapot ones. I usually press preheat, wait one or two minutes, then shove my food in and resume heating for the remaining three to four minutes (the preset is 400f for 5min). So far made sweet potatoes fries, eggplant cubes, chocolate cake, reheat frozen waffles, Chinese left overs, scallion pancakes, egg rolls, Chinese cruellers... Yes, I was initially introduced to the air fryer for the purpose of reheating Chinese leftovers. No need to add extra oil, just shove and heat, easier and more crispy than microwaving."},{"reviewerName":"booklovingpuppy","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Strong awful smell or plastic smell","reviewDate":"February 26, 2019","reviewText":"The smell comes from heated cooking container.

I am 85 and I needed something simple to understand and use. I have made two different meals. The first was not too good. It was my fault. I defrosted my chicken breast and I did not time it right. I put them in to short of time and they were a little tough. BUT my next thing I air fried was shrimp. They were out of this world good. My husband raved about how good they were.

Mmm honey Sriracha recipe was amazing! When I opened the basket up to flip halfway through the Cook time....I was blown away by the smell and crisp when using a tong. The next thing I had to try was the roasted halved potatoes and it was just as good. I can't wait to make some chicken thighs and asparagus for dinner tomorrow. I can't stop using this air fryer....officially an addict. When I was researching on which brand to get I had to have one where it was easy to clean the basket and this was a breeze, just some warm soapy water and non-abrasive sponge does the trick.

So far I have prepared Baked cornish hens, chicken breasts, smoked sausages, hamburgers, baked potatoes, and have been pleasantly surprised with each recipe. The cornish hens were the most surprising since they cooked for less than 1/2 hour each and were juicy, thoroughly cooked and just the right toasty skin texture. I highly recommend the air fryer.

Why does it smell like I am?","reviewDate":"January 25, 2019","reviewText":"Update 2/11/2019: Against my better judgement, I have used it a few times. The smell of plastic is starting to fade a bit. I wonder how much of it I've ingested. I've cooked french fries a few times. Now the entire thing is starting to make a rattling noise when it runs for more than 15 or so minutes. I don't have confidence that it is going to last all that long, when it is already making rattling noises and I haven't even had it two weeks.\n\nI want to keep and like it. It has so many good reviews. I just don't think that it's going to work out.\n\nUpdate 2/5/2019: I received the replacement yesterday. I haven't even started cooking with it yet and I can still smell a very strong plastic odor that appears to be coming from the top. I have an air quality monitor that detects VOCs. I put it by the area where it smells the strongest and it started registering abnormal levels of VOCs. I don't know if this means anything, but it does show that the product's plastic is off-gassing something. When I noticed the smell upon taking it out of the box yesterday, I promptly took it outside and left it in the fresh air all day. That didn't make any difference at all. It smelled just as bad when I brought it back inside. It's unlikely that I am going to keep this and I don't see the point of replacing it a second time. It's really too bad because it seems like a decent device other than that. That smell, though. Terrible.\n\nNice air fryer. I've cooked a few times with it since I got it and it has done a great job. French fries come out crispy. The only problem is that from the first use, there's been the overwhelming smell of something plastic burning. I followed the instructions to the letter and made sure to remove all of the stickers and everything. I thoroughly cleaned the basket and wiped down the inside of the fryer, including the heating element, before first use. Now I have a permanent smell of plastic on the first floor of my house. I smelled the entire appliance and the plastic smell is strongest at the bottom and top of the appliance. The basket doesn't smell at all. It makes me wonder if it is safe for me to be using it. I'm dropping my rating down to 1 star.\n\nI will continue to use it and monitor it carefully. I am hoping that over time, the smell will fade."},{"reviewerName":"R. Mallett","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Small on the outside, big capacity inside, best Air Fryer out there!!","reviewDate":"December 13, 2018","reviewText":"I’ve had experiences with three other air fryers before trying the Cosori 5.8 qt. - Phillips, GoWise, and Habor. All three were excellent. But, they were BIG. I’m so in love with this Cosori and can rest easy that I made the right choice in selecting this air fryer as the one I’m sticking with. One of the main reasons I love it so much is the size – so much smaller than most on the market (look at picture of it next to my Blendtec blender), but had just as much capacity in the basket! The controls are intuitive and easy to use. It’s the best looking one on the market – and we know how important THAT is! The programmable keep warm function is awesome and when it comes to cooking it performs amazingly well. Clean up is an absolute breeze. Last night I cooked a whole chicken and the drawer wiped clean with a paper towel and almost no effort. Nothing stuck to the great nonstick finish. While the chicken rested, I roasted asparagus in 6 minutes, then garlic toast in 3! The chicken was so delicious, it almost brought tears to my eyes! Fall off the bone tender, juicy, and parts of the skin as crispy and delicious as any pork cracklin’ (chicharrón) I’ve ever tasted. Thank you, Cosori, for making such an awesome appliance. Not to bore you with yet more praise, but about 6 months ago, I purchased the wildly popular Instant Pot pressure cooker. I absolutely love my Instant Pot – was cooking dinner in it almost every night. Until I got my Cosori Air Fryer. I’ve only used the Instant Pot once since then. If you knew how much I love to cook, and how enamored I was (and am) with the Instant Pot, you’d know what a big deal that is! Another small thing I like about the Cosori is that the corners of the basket are not quite as rounded, a little more \"squared off\", which makes it a little more spacious. OH - like I said, over the years, I've owned/used now four air fryers - all top quality. Of the four, I've only been contacted by ONE manufacturer - COSORI. They emailed me and asked if I was happy with their product and if there was anything I needed or if I had any suggestions on how to improve the air fryer. That's an example of exceptional customer service. I was already completely sold on it, but if not, that would certainly have sealed the deal!!"},{"reviewerName":"Just me","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Ok, I’ll admit it... I’m a snob.","reviewDate":"February 20, 2019","reviewText":"Or should I say, I’m paticular... yeah, that’s it, paticular. I’m not one to jump on the bandwagon of a new craze or product right away. (Case in point, I bought my first toaster oven last year 😳 and have yet to purchase an Instapot). My scenario for a kitchen appliance goes something like this...\n\n1) First and foremost, I have to be convinced that it’s something I will use... that will make my life easier. Something that will make me want to kick myself in the posterior for not buying it sooner.\n\n2) Secondly, it’s got to look good (this is where the snob part comes in ;) After all, if it’s going to take up precious real estate on my countertop, it better damn site look good. No shiny plastic football shaped appliances for my kitchen, thank you.\n\n3) Third (and this is the most time consuming) I research it to death. The pros, the cons, the ‘mehs’, YouTube videos, manufacturer websites, Facebook groups. Yep, I read user reviews like they were Consumer Reports (confession... always starting with the 1-star 😬).\n\nSo why do I suck all the joy out of making a spontaneous purchase you ask? Because I’m at a point in my life where I’m tired of owning and storing things I rarely use (hello waffle iron, rice cooker, kitchen aide mixer, etc., etc., etc.) Because I appreciate quality, utility, durability and attractiveness...throw in ‘good value / price’ and you’ve just checked all my buy boxes. Now, don’t get me wrong, I am in the ‘you get what you pay for’ camp and have absolutely no problem buying top of the line. However, if I can find a quality product at a good price, all the better. So, how did the process go with Air Fryers?\n\nAir Fryer:\nDo I want it? Yes. Need it? Truthfully, no. Use it? Probably. Will it make my life easier? Oh hell yes! No more greasy cooktops to clean and that’s a huge plus in my book. So, that’s a big YES for adding an air fryer to my kitchen appliances. Here’s how Cosori did:\n\nAppearance - Love the sleek design and classy brushed finish of the Cosori. Can a kitchen appliance actually be described as beautiful? Why yes, yes it can. ;)\n\nResearch / Design - It seems that Cosori looked at all the complaints from different models of air fryers and designed their product addressing those complaints. The top does not open so it fits on the countertop, under cabinets. The footprint is relatively compact compared to some other models. The basket is squarish with good capacity, by design accomodating more food than round baskets. Large, easy to read display. Digital presets including Preheat (Note: Do NOT skip this step. Despite what other manufacturers claim, preheating will definitely make a difference in many of your recipes). Shake reminder. Turns itself off when done. Super easy to clean. No problem with the basket’s non-stick finish flaking off. Comes with a 2 year warranty. Surprisingly nice cookbook included. Very responsive customer service. Bottom line? Quality product, 2 Year warranty. So far, so good.\n\nValue / Price - A big YES here. The Cosori Air Fryer 5.8qt is $119. The Phillips (my second choice) is $249+ depending on the model you select.\n\nSummary: I’m sad to say I was unfamiliar with Cosori prior to my research of Air Fryers. So although this is the first of their products I’ve owned, it likely won’t be my last. If the Cosori Air Fryer is representative of the quality of their other products... I’m definitely a fan. I use my Air Fryer 4-5 times a week and am very happy with the purchase. Style, quality, value... Cosori has it all. Highly recommended.\n\nDisclaimer: I did NOT receive a free Cosori Air Fryer to try in exchange for my review.... Dang it."},{"reviewerName":"M. Gondek","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Good, but with frustrations","reviewDate":"January 8, 2019","reviewText":"I absolutely loved this air fryer after the first couple of recipes, which turned out great. Easy to use, easy to clean, and fast. Then I made more recipes (both from the mini cookbook they send with the fryer, and a couple of reliable ones I've made in the oven in the past) - and my disappointment grew. For reference, I consider myself an intermediate/advanced home cook that'll try most anything with fish, chicken, or baked goods. I'm cooking for two, and find the size about right for two pieces of fish or chicken, two generous servings of tater tots/veg, or four muffins.\n\nI'll summarize pros/cons below, but first, here are the things I've made so far and their results:\n\n- Teriyaki glazed salmon (Cosori recipe). Excellent! The fish came out perfectly cooked for our tastes (medium well) and still moist. The glaze was really tasty, although I'll make half as much next time.\n- Roasted cauliflower (Cosori). Very good. The veg came out with a little crunch to it, with decent flavor.\n- Roasted garlic broccoli (Cosori). Meh. I used half the salt/garlic powder, and it was still way, way too much. The broccoli also came out way overcooked.\n- Crispy \"fried\" fish nuggets (Cosori). Meh. The fish was cooked adequately, but it was very bland - no Old Bay flavor at all. There's also no way the recipe can be made in one batch, since you'd have to really overfill the basket (and reduce the crispiness/increase cooking time). We made it in two batches, and it was reasonably crispy, but that's the best we can say about it.\n- Chocolate Espresso Muffins (Cosori). Ugh. Some of the most flavorless muffins I've ever eaten. Utterly bland and pointless, although they were nicely cooked and had a reasonably tender crumb.\n- Tater tots (pre-packaged). Okay. I wasn't sure whether to use the Frozen setting or the instructions to \"reduce recommended cooking time by 20% and temperature by 25 degrees.\" I chose the former, and they turned out fine. Not as crispy as I like, so I might increase the temp next time by 10 or 20 degrees (you can't increase the cooking time on Frozen beyond 10 minutes).\n- Mini pound cake (another cookbook). Ugh, ugh, gross. I've made this recipe many times in the oven and toaster oven, so I figured it was a safe one to attempt. Terrible. As instructed in the \"tips\" sheet, I reduced cooking time and temperature. The first batch turned out overly cooked outside, raw inside. The second batch turned out okay outside, still raw inside. I ran out of buttermilk and all will to continue at this point, but may try again later. I'll update if I do.\n\nThe Good\n1. Easy to use. The multiple presets are almost overwhelming, but they do help once you figure out the icons. The makers went very granular, with different settings for \"vegetables\" vs. \"root vegetables,\" for example. The first recipe I made, I felt almost like I was doing it wrong, it was so easy. This seems like a very friendly appliance for a beginner cook, assuming they know whether to use \"frozen,\" shrimp vs. seafood, veg vs. root veg, etc. There's a page in the instruction book to help with this, so I suggest keeping it handy.\n\n2. Easy to clean. I followed the suggestion in the instructions to line the outer basket with foil, which makes clean up insanely easy. I also love that the baskets are dishwasher-safe. There are also handy instructions for removing stuck-on food, if you need them.\n\n3. Fast for longer cook times. Anything that usually takes a while in the oven comes out faster with this fryer. That's a great time saver by itself. BUT fast-cooking things like fish and vegetables cook in about the same amount of time that they would on the stove or oven, especially when you figure in pre-heat time.\n\n4. Versatile. I was amazed at the range of foods in the mini cookbook, from baked goods to potatoes to steak. I made three complete meals (protein, starch, veg) with this to try it out, keeping things warm in the oven while the final items cooked. Worked well for that. BUT see my comment about 10-degree increments, below!\n\n5. Could be an oven substitute. Unless you like to bake a lot, I could easily see this fryer replacing a regular oven in a dorm (if allowed), small apartment, or similar situation. Or even in the summer, when turning on the oven overheats the house, this is a fantastic alternative.\n\n6. Fewer smells!!! I was thrilled to find that cooking things like fish and broccoli resulted in much less smell in the house. Normally I like to air the house out after dinner, but this fryer almost eliminated the need.\n\n7. Less mess. Since the frying is contained, there's zero spatter to clean up.\n\n8. Great instruction manual. Appliances don't generally have the best instructions, but Cosori does a very nice job with theirs. Easy to read, easy to skim, well organized, and comprehensive. I do wish the \"tips\" page had been included in the manual so it's harder to lose, but that's it.\n\nThe Not-So-Good\n\n1. Only 10 degree increments! Even though the instructions CLEARLY tell you to adapt recipes by reducing the temp by 25 degrees, the machine can ONLY be adjusted in 10-degree increments. The marketing people obviously didn't get the memo about the product specs. So like my pound cake recipe, which should have been cooked at 325 for 26 minutes, I could only try it at 320 and 330. Given the lousy results, it'll take a LOT of experimentation to adapt recipes reliably. This single factor seriously limits the fryer's versatility, and seems like a pretty stupid design flaw.\n\n2. The beeps. Oh. My. Gosh. The beeps. Too loud. Constant. It beeps when you turn it on. When you turn it off. When you choose a setting. When you start cooking. When you need to shake the basket (3 times). When you reinsert the basket. When you adjust the time (once for each minute). When you adjust the temp (once for each increment). When it's finished (3 times). And the beep is LOUD. I will never try to use this while someone in my house is sleeping. People with sleeping babies, beware.\n\n3. The buttons aren't responsive. I have to press the play/pause button multiple times to get it to start/pause, and adjusting the time/temp is equally frustrating. This type of button isn't exactly new technology, so no idea why it's so bad.\n\n4. There's little caramelization. Although food browns decently in the fryer, there's very little of the nutty caramelized flavor I associate with a good sear or broil. I assume this is because the temp isn't high enough to form the brown crust quickly, but I'm not a food science person and can only guess. I'll definitely make fish or chicken on the stove when I want the sear, and only use the fryer when I'm going to drown it in sauce (and wouldn't taste the sear anyway). Ditto for vegetables. Plain cauliflower, for example, is excellent when sauteed for 6-8 minutes, but only so-so from this fryer.\n\n5. You DON'T use less oil than sauteing. The instructions tell you to oil everything before it goes into the fryer, and to add more oil if the food isn't crispy enough. I end up using the same amount that I use for stove-top and oven cooking, even though I *thought* air frying was supposed to be healthier. Healthier than deep-frying, I suppose.\n\n6. The recipe photos don't match the foods. For example, the portions shown don't reflect what the recipe makes (\"crab cakes\" shows 7, the recipe makes 4). But what's worse is that they actually show the food prepared in things like cast-iron pans or a large casserole dish, rather than the fryer. Huh? This is minor, but I usually rely on the photos to show me what the results should look like, and these photos don't do that.\n\n7. No info on what size containers to use. Although recipes call for \"mini cake pans\" or \"muffin cups,\" for example, there's no info anywhere on capacity. And I found that portion size affects cooking time dramatically with this fryer. Since there's a huge range of sizes on the market, it takes a lot of experimentation to figure out what will work, even for the recipes in the Cosori book.\n\nSo who is this fryer probably best for? I'd say it's great for anyone in a small living space, or anyone who doesn't want to use their oven. It's good for beginners, and those who plan to sauce their food a lot, or don't care about caramelization (sear/broil). It's also good to minimize mess of frying, or to free up the oven for other food. Also for people who want to experiment a LOT to adapt recipes from other sources.\n\nWho is it probably not good for? Anyone who has sleeping babies nearby, because of the beeps. People who care about caramelized flavor. Anyone who wants to EASILY adapt recipes from other cookbooks. Anyone who wants to cook a whole meal fast (you can only cook one thing at a time, obviously).\n\nI'd say this fryer is best for cooking proteins or potatoes (scratch or packaged), less so for baked goods or vegetables. But it does work for those in a pinch. Recommended with reservations."},{"reviewerName":"M. Chambers","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Excellent Air Fryer with Large Capacity / Square Basket","reviewDate":"December 31, 2018","reviewText":"After much comparison shopping, I settled on this large capacity air fryer with a square basket and it has been a great purchase. While it is not the cheapest unit on the market, it seems to be reliable, solidly made, easy to use, and have the right mix of features, in my humble opinion.\n\nCalling this an \"air fryer\" is a bit of a misnomer: it is really more like a handy-sized countertop convection oven. While it can \"air fry\" foods that you might normally deep fry or pan fry, it also does a great job of toasting, roasting, or baking. Since we got it, my entire family has been busily using it to cook almost anything and everything. It is easy to clean and easy to operate. The controls are simple and straightforward with all the things you need (digital time and temperature, a good number of presets, etc.) and none of the things you don't (Personally, I think features like a touch screen are overkill for this sort of appliance - a touch screen would be just another thing that might break down prematurely....).\n\nThe only downside I have detected is that most air fryer accessories on the market (e.g. racks, grill plates, liners, etc.) are either round-shaped or sized for a smaller capacity unit. It seems hard to find decent accessories that accurately fit and take advantage of a larger square-basketed air fryer like this one. My recommendation would be that Cosori come up with an accessory bundle (racks, silicone cooking pads, liners, grilling plates and mesh plates, etc.) specifically designed for this excellent appliance."},{"reviewerName":"D.J.W.","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Best purchase this year for my kitchen","reviewDate":"December 17, 2018","reviewText":"This is the best addition for my kitchen in the last year, we use it about everyday. The only thing is trying to get frozen fries to taste like they are from a deep fryer is tricky. You need to use more oil on them for a good taste and good crispiness. Cooks most things up really nice, as well as reheats things quickly like left over bread sticks and pasta (covered). My daughter loves cooking her chicken wings in it, she says it is better than the oven. Very easy to clean and easy to use. The size has been great for the 3 of us and there is room for when I need to make extra for company.

I love the taste of the foods, the crispiness, and the ease of cooking in this machine. However, the smell of burning plastic or chemicals does NOT go away, we have used it many many times in hopes that it would. It's not as bad about halfway through the cooking because you start to smell the food, but the preheating and beginning of cooking is almost unbearable. My husband who isn't usually bothered by stuff like this, gets nauseous from the smell because it's so bad, and I have to leave all the windows open when cooking. I'm concerned what this smell could be, and how harmful it is that my children and I are breathing it in. Because of this, I don't ever really want to use it anymore! Also, it's a nightmare to clean when you make anything greasy in it, like fried chicken, or any kind of meat. The fat and grease have too many crevices to go in the inner container and you really have to scrub those out well, which is difficult. The bottom portion is easy to clean, but the one with the holes and slots is not. Also, there is no real easy way to clean the area inside the machine that all the grease is splattering on - the heating coils! I try to get up there with a wet towel to try to clean the grease off, but there are so many areas I can't reach and what comes off on the napkin is disgusting. I don't know if all air fryers are like this, but there should be an easier way to clean these things, but the deal breaker is mainly the burning plastic smell. It's just too powerful and potent, I just can't imagine that's not absolutely toxic for all of us."},{"reviewerName":"BevMama1","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"My Family Is Calling Me the Walking Infomercial","reviewDate":"September 24, 2019","reviewText":"This fryer literally changed my life!

I use it DAILY for all kinds of foods (bacon, kale chips, brussel sprouts, sweet potatoes, french fries, eggs, crab cakes, chicken wings, pork chops, and so much more) and I can't stop singing its praises. It makes everything so crispy and it does it quickly. Very easy and quick cleanup.\n\nNow, this size is very big, so it takes up a lot of counter space, but I wanted a large size to make large portions easily. This is my first fryer, but my friends have made comparisons to their fryers and it does seem like this particular brand/model is among the best because it actually does make crispy foods. I also appreciate the recipes in the book that came with it. I've made several of them....things I didn't even think to make in a fryer like cinnamon rolls and mini apple pies. (My only issue with the recipe book is that it was cheaply made and the pages too easily fell apart.) The only other caution that I have is that you have to be careful with things flying up to the top heater and \"catching fire\"/ smoking."},{"reviewerName":"JVG","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Quick Cooking, Tasty Results","reviewDate":"September 16, 2019","reviewText":"I got this for my birthday after reading the reviews. I especially enjoyed reading the review from someone who said she was not a good cook. I do consider myself a good cook. I ordered two spray bottles that I filled with oil and I already had a digital thermometer which I consider essential. I will try to give you some different experiences I have had with the Corsi.\n\nI have cooked frozen biscuits at about half the time as in our electric range. Preheating takes only about 4-5 minutes as opposed to 10-12 minutes in our range for the same temp. I cooked frozen ready made Cordon Bleu and cooked it\nat the recommended temp for only 17 minutes instead of the 31-33 recommended for a regular oven. French Fries are great, especially Steak Fries by O. About 10 minutes using the FF setting and reducing the time. Steak, Pork Chops, and Meat Loaf turned out great too. I used my digital therm. to check the doneness. I don't eat seafood so I cannot comment on that. Left over Pizza takes only 3-4 minutes after you preheat and tastes just as good as the first time. I have not try any recipes from their cookbook but do check it out for ideas. I have not baked in it yet but I have taken part of an unsliced loaf of bread out of the freezer, thawed it for 30 secs in the Micro and then put it in the Corsi for 3-5 minutes in the preheated unit. Bread is soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside which is true of many items cooked in the Corsi. Originally I made a place on a shelf to store it but now it is on the countertop because we use it almost every day. Cleaning is a snap too. I put the cooking trays into soapy water in the sink. Nothing has stuck yet. Cleans up easily and dries quickly. It seemed like a large piece to put into the dishwasher and we use it almost everyday. I forgot to mention that I purchase plain donuts from the supermarket and put them in a preheated unit for 2-3 minutes. They taste great hot!\nWe live in Florida where summers are hot and we don't like to heat up the kitchen with the range. The sides get warm but not hot except for the vent in the back. It is a little noisy, similar to low speed on a range hood. Overall, we like it and find this size a good choice because most foods for us can prepared in this appliance. I especially enjoy the French Fries."},{"reviewerName":"Horselady","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Some good, some bad","reviewDate":"The manufacturer commented on the review below","reviewText":"I am redoing my review since I have been using this product for awhile. I liked it a lot better at first, but the more I use it, the more I am seeing some issues. I do like that you don't have that oil mess from regular frying but in some things, the quality suffers, particularly if you are doing French fries, which is why a lot of people get this kind of product in the first place. Homemade fries just don't come out very consistently. Frozen fries come out a bit better. What I am doing now is cutting my potatoes into 1 inch cubes for more of a roasted potato and they taste much better. Does a good job with bacon and burgers.\n\nMy issue with this fryer is the clean up. The bottom cleans up well, but the cage that sits on top is another story. It is very difficult to get it clean and if you aren't meticulous, you will get a build up that is extremely difficult to remove. I am dealing with this right now. I thought I was cleaning it well, using a brush to get in the slats, but today I was rather upset to see built up gunk in between the slats, which is proving very hard to remove. I don't want to be cooking in something that doesn't feel or look clean so I don't know how all this will turn out."},{"reviewerName":"SuzyQ","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"It’s a keeper - I bought two","reviewDate":"March 11, 2019","reviewText":"I’m enjoying Cosori’s 5.8 quart air fryer, and use it almost every day. I purchased two, one for the main course and another for the side dish. I like that I only need a light spritz of oil (I use avocado oil) to get a super crispy coating on fish, chicken, and pork. This air fryer also does a nice job with vegetables, like carrots, green beans, brussel sprouts, and cauliflower - and of course french fries or homefries. I bought it to make chicken wings, and it’s the king of chicken wings. They always come out juicy, crispy and flavorful. You feel like you’re having something sinful, but there’s nothing sinful about a Tsp of oil for a meal to serve four people.\n\nI’m a baker, and so was pleasantly surprised to learn that most things bake nicely in this mini convection oven; muffins, cheesecake, and banana bread, wow! They all come out great. My blueberry-raspberry streusel topped muffins bake up in just 10 min in a 4-muffin tin. (see pics)\n\nClean up is mostly a breeze, depending on what you put in there. I’ve learned to brush a light coating of barbecue sauce on chicken with only three minutes cook time remaining, so to avoid food burning and staining/splatter where I can’t reach to clean well. I’ve noticed that splatters sometimes do make it above the cooking element to the fan and above. It’s not easy to clean there, but a wet q-tip works pretty well. Mostly I want to avoid having something too saucy in there that will send splatters up where I’d rather not have to clean. Also, I worry about the lifetime of the unit in that regard.\n\nCleaning the basket is usually pretty routine, except I’ve noticed that non-stick spray is a big no-no. It tends to gum up on the basket after a few meals, and is difficult to clean off without marring the non-stick coating. The “fins” design of the basket is ideal for allowing the hot air through, but not for cleaning. Don’t let that scare you away from buying, just be aware that you may need to soak the basket for a while. The bottom piece has never been a problem to clean.\n\nCosori’s air fryer is a great addition to my kitchen. I imagine that it will be a huge blessing on hot days when heating the oven (and the kitchen with it) is the last thing I want to do. The Cosori staff and chefs have been great and quick about answering multiple questions. I’m impressed with their offering of an extra year’s warranty, too."},{"reviewerName":"Farmtown","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Still learning to use","reviewDate":"January 27, 2019","reviewText":"I read reviews here about different air fryers and so picked this one because of its high ratings.

But after that, no problems.\nThe only things I have done so far: toasted croutons from old bread and cooked bacon. I am looking forward to cooking chicken, steak and hamburgers.\nThe biggest advantage I see will be saving the time and energy of heating up the full size oven. Also (especially for bacon and meats) there will be no mess on the stove form using a frying pan.\nClean up (as they said) is very easy. I just wash by hand since it is so easy. Maybe sometime I will use the dishwasher.\nToday I tried baking eggs inside a little dish in the unit. Took too long so I will not do that again. And I doubt I will ever try baking a cake or anything. But maybe a little pizza.\nWe keep our unit stored in the cupboard, so the little handle slots on the sides make moving it very easy.\n\nUpdate: tonight we cooked two chicken breasts. (After pre-heat), used chicken setting from owners manual: 380 degrees for 25 min. Put a little olive oil on top and bottom of chicken. Turned out fine and very moist.

Love the preheat setting, the auto settings and the shake indicator.

It cleans up like a breeze... just take the drawer out, rinse with hot water and wipe out with a paper towel. No stick. I have \"pre-seasoned\" it with a very light coating of coconut oil which really helps as well. This is a well made and well designed unit. I don't care for the typical \"look\" of many air fryers or the small baskets, so this one really stepped it up.

That one I'm not sure of, as I haven't tasted it yet!\n\nWe've been playing with this ever since we got it off the treasure truck this week. Thus far I've tried a variety of frozen battered snack foods, which all came out much better than they ever did in my oven. We've also tried fries, breakfast sausages and bacon, which also turned out well. Bake and serve rolls were done much faster than in the oven with a nice crust, even from frozen. The only thing we've tried thus far that didn't turn out so well was grilled cheese. Much better done in an iron skillet. It actually dried out the bread, with or without buttering it.\n\nThis is essentially a tabletop convection oven. Since I have a pretty good gas oven without the convection feature, it's a bonus for me. It's very easy to clean and reuse, often just rinsing and wiping clean unless oil and grease are produced. The teflon coating prevents stuck on food. It is essential to preheat before cooking anything, since getting the basket nice and hot beforehand helps the food cook better. Be warned though, the foods come out very hot as does the drawer. I had a silicone mat down to protect my wood tabletop and resting the drawer for only a few seconds melted it a little!\n\nThe basket is a decent size and can hold a normal size bag of chicken nuggets or fries with ease.

Once again, my oven has no problem with those. But the keto videos were showing me perfectly cooked brussel sprouts, asperagus, and chicken. I chose the Cosori because of the large square basket and it looks much nicer then most of the others on the market. First up was bacon and brussel sprouts. I cooked a few steps of bacon, they came out perfect, and then coated the sprouts in a tablespoon of the bacon grease and they came out perfect. Crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. I've now been using it everyday. It roasts veggies so much faster then my oven and I don't have to babysit them. The other night I used it for wings and my son deep fried a batch of wings.

Cooks foods perfectly and it’s SUPER easy to clean. We went with the larger version and let me tell you, it’s big. Like a lot of counter space is needed. I wish I went with the smaller option as there are only two of us in the family currently but the large is just fine. Especially if cooking for guests.

I was not expecting a 5 star review for an appliance, but I'm happy to say that this thing really delivers!\n\nFirst thing is first - read the manual for sure. You'll find \"Presets\" available on the control pad - they work great, for what they are specific to! Example - pressing the \"Chicken\" button is specific to a number of drumsticks, Wings, etc. IF you use those same settings for chicken fingers, you'll be disappointed :)\n\nKey is to review the instructions and plan to use it a couple of times first knowing that until you get the right settings for the cuts of meat you buy: Costco frozen chicken breasts, Tyson frozen out of the freezer section, fresh from the butcher - etc. - you'll have to cook a little more or less until you \"Dial it in\" just right.\n\nOnce you get it right - the sky is the limit!

I have been on the fence and scouting about for the best air fryer to try out. I am so glad I went with Cosori instead of a 6qt one.\n\nI've made: bacon, which came out nice and crispy and not over or under cooked. Hot sandwiches from a grilled cheese and tomato, ham and cheese, and other versions of a nice hot sandwich. They all came out perfect melted and the bread was nice and toasted! A delightful crunch to every bite. Meatloaf, which was amazing! It kept well together and was not dried out. Herbed chicken thighs and legs, which were fall off the bone juicy and delicious. There is still so much more I can't wait to make and try with this air fryer, especially desserts. I am more than sure I won't be disappointed.\n\nThe packaging is nicely done. The recipe book is a wonderful touch to a great item. So many delicious recipes to try.

I first purchased the Ninja and tried it out. I liked the style and simplicity of use. The Ninja has basic functions, on/off, temp up/down and time up/down. The basket is deep and round. It is a good unit. However the Cosori has a few more features, better warranty and the basket is square. The Cosori has a pre-heat function which is very nice. The Cosori has a square basket that is large, easy to clean and is square instead of round. With the square basket you can add the air fryer accessories with room on the sides to get them out when they are hot. The Cosori has a keep warm function and a shake reminder. I also like that on the Cosori i can change the temp or time while the unit is already cooking and the shake reminder still works with the new time or temp. Cleaning the basket is easy and effortless. I use the Cosori about 5 day's a week and find that it's a must have kitchen accessory. I haven't tried any of the recipes that come with it or use most of preset buttons. Everything i have cooked in this unit has cooked perfectly. I find that on fries and tater tots i don't have to shake them as the basket is big enough that a single layer is all i need to cook. Items i have tried are; burgers, hot dogs, teriyaki chicken skewers, chicken breast, frozen pizza, fries, tater tots, hash brown patties, sausage patties, popcorn chicken, chicken patties, country fried steak, ribeye steak, meatballs and toast. I do thaw out the raw meats before cooking but everything else i cook frozen."},{"reviewerName":"Dan The Driver","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Love It","reviewDate":"January 20, 2019","reviewText":"OK have to be honest I have only had this a short time and only used it a few times but so far everything had come out awesome. I made chicken wings that were crispy and perfectly cooked, though it took a little longer than the book said because I like them really crispy. I also made PERFECT mozzarella sticks, a major weakness of mine. The book shows you how to make your own bites (as they call them). I just bought a box of frozen ones from BJs and used the same cooking directions. They came out so perfect, spray a little veg. cooking spray on them and they come out as good as any dinner can make them in just 12 min. (4 min. to pre-heat, 8 min. to cook).\n\nI ordered from Amazon, but got emails from the manufacturer for warranty and help if needed. I like a company that will stand behind a product before you will need them. As of yet I have had no problems whatsoever, even when I accidentally cooked the user manual, I wouldn't recommend doing that btw.\n\nAll in all I love this Air Frier and would recommend it to anyone. It's great for cooking smaller portions of traditionally oil fried foods without all the oil and mess.

Everything has turned out great, and tastes so much better than cooking in the oven or microwave. The fries came out so crispy, usually if I have reheated them in the microwave they just get soggy and have to be thrown out. I am so impressed with this cooker that I'm taking my microwave out of the kitchen, I'll use the Cosari to heat leftovers from now on. The included recipe book has lots of great recipes, and I like that there is even a Facebook group that shares recipes. You can tell a lot of time and effort has gone into making this air fryer so wonderful. The basket is large and square, it can hold more than a round basket, some brands have deep round baskets , but the depth is wasted because you want good air flow for crisping so it's better not to stack too much food in at once. Some have metal grates on the bottom that are hard to clean, this unit has holes in the bottom and that makes it really fast and easy to clean which is a big plus. I like all the preset buttons, they are very easy to use and so far they have all been correct on timing!

Great for vegetarians too!","reviewDate":"November 7, 2019","reviewText":"I obsessively combed the reviews on this for many weeks before buying it. It’s my first air fryer - I really did not want to buy another cooking gadget unless I knew I would be using it frequently - and it turns out I’m using it a lot!\n\nI actually bought this in black as a gift for a friend who actually just wanted some healthier eating cookbooks. Wow cookbooks are expensive LOL and there were only a few recipes in each one that I thought she would actually make. My friend is a no- fuss person with a super busy lifestyle who really doesn’t like to cook so I knew she wouldn’t be compelled to use cookbooks. I figured if she uses this air fryer to cook her usual food - but by using less oil/ fat - it would be a good boost for her plan to eat more healthy. She liked it so much that she convinced me to buy one for myself!\n\nI bought the white one and it blends beautifully with my white kitchen cabinets. I bought the XL and although it’s slightly larger than what I need I have to admit the size comes in handy when making things that need more air circulating around them for even browning. For example, yesterday I made an acorn squash - from whole squash to plate in 20 minutes! - and appreciated the extra room in the basket.\n\nI am a vegetarian and my husband is an omnivore. I made a chicken dinner\nfor him last night that had chicken skin so golden brown crisp that you could hear the knife and fork going through it. If I ate meat I would be flipping out because it did look THAT good!\n\nAlso, I was concerned that if I make meat in it then my vegetarian food would smell or taste like meat. Not the case! This machine is a CINCH to clean and does not hold on to odors. The white casing also does not stain and is easy to wipe off. I LOVE that white color!\n\nWhile I am on the topic, some reviews complain about a plastic smell or that the machine is smoking. This did not happen to me, but I think I know what happened. When you receive this machine there is a TON of packing material really jammed into the machine to keep it stable during shipping.\nMy machine had paper and tape (!) inside of it. My guess is that the people who complain about smoking and smells did not thoroughly remove all of the tape. It can be hard to miss so take time and care when initially setting this up to make sure all that packing is removed.\n\nThe included cookbook is extremely helpful. I found that the cooking times were a little long for some things but it’s just common sense. If you have meat that is thin cut, or cooking a boneless chicken breast vs a drumstick, the cooking time will be a little less. Try not to take the recipes so literally that it overrides common sense.\n\nAnother common complaint is with regard to removing the basket from the drawer. LOL this took me a few seconds to figure out but once you get it, its easy. When you pull the drawer out of the machine you first have to slide the clear colored switch on the handle forward to unlock it or it won’t come out. Once you have the drawer out, there is a black button just in front of the clear plastic “slide” switch that you just push down... and voila, the basket releases from the drawer. That black “push down” button is so perfectly camouflaged into the handle it is very difficult to see, but it is right there hiding in plain sight. To recap: Push forward to unlock, push down to release. Done!\n\nFinally, as a person who hates to use oil for almost any reason - hence my purchase of an “air fryer”- here is a tip I haven’t read in any reviews yet. Get a spray bottle, the kind that really mists liquid instead of streams it. Fill the bottle with about a teaspoon of oil and mix it with about 4 tablespoons of water. Just a little oil goes a long way but makes a HUGE difference in terms of the brown color and crunchiness of the food! Now shake that bottle like crazy and immediately mist your food with it. Do not let the oil and water separate! You need very little mist to make a giant improvement. I usually use one “mist” per chicken thigh or drumstick. Since the machine only holds about 6 of these you can see how little oil-water mix you need to use. If you do spritz with oil be sure to do this within the LAST 5-7 minutes of the cooking time, otherwise the heat is too intense and instead of crispy golden brown, your food will look like a charred piece of wood.\n\nI store the left over water-oil mix in the mister in the refrigerator or I just throw it out and wash out the mister for next time. If you don’t want to spend $10-15 on a formal “oil\nMister” you can do what I did and buy a travel sized spray bottle (2-3 ounces?) at your local drug store for 99 cents. Or, if you have some other food product in your house that came in a misting bottle just recycle that for personal use. Works like a charm!\n\nI’m glad I bought this machine and I use it frequently. It cooks food really quickly and the flavor of everything is really good, just like “home cooking” should be. Buying fresh meats and controlling the spices, salt, and oil is much healthier and arguably faster than buying some mass produced mystery food and cooking it in the microwave. For me and my vegetarian ways, being able to cook quickly and “cleanly” (no oil for me thanks) is exactly what I want.\n\nThis makes cooking fun and cleanup is a breeze! Enjoy your new air fryer... and buy the white one! 😀"},{"reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Glad I Recieved This Air Fryer","reviewDate":"March 19, 2019","reviewText":"Both my sons purchased different brand air fryers. Theirs were smaller models. They liked them but could not fry too many items at one time for their families. I am widowed with only me and I got this larger COSORI 5.8 qt. model because of all the good reviews here on Amazon and also because the price dropped so close to the price of the smaller model that it made sense to get the larger version. I am glad I have the larger model because there is just enough room for one layer of food that fits my portion sizes. I have been using it for about a month and love it. I use aluminum foil to line the bottom of the basket and save cleaning. The first time, I made the mistake of putting the foil in the pan without any food during the warming process of the machine - DON'T the air from the fan lifted the foil and chopped the corners of the foil into pieces. From then on, I line the basket to get the size of the foil. Then, I remove the foil during warming cycle and put it back in with food as soon as the warming cycle finishes. So far the cooking time has been pretty close to the automatic selections on the front panel. I have adjusted times on some items when they seemed to be too thick or too frozen and were not quite finished all the way through. I am impressed with this COSORI air fryer as it is easy and faster than heating up the oven on my stove. I am hoping it continues to work as well for some time."},{"reviewerName":"Stratixman","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"So far great","reviewDate":"November 6, 2019","reviewText":"Purchased the 5.8 qt model last week when it was on sale for $30 off. Had been thinking about air fryers for some time but doing research I always found inconsistent reviews and ratings, or those that got high marks were kind of expensive. Then I came across the Cosori on sale at Amazon. Read many of the over 3000 basically 4 and 5 star reviews; concluded the feature set and capacity ticked my wants; compared the unit to multiple other options and decided to take the plunge with Cosori while the price was good. So far its been great. The overall design seems well thought out. I like the square basket design vs round baskets of other competitors. Safety features are well thought out. The manufacture quality is very good. The warranty is very good. The front touch control panel is easy to use both as to preserts and manual operation. It is easy to clean. Not a negative; but the unit is large (I wanted larger capacity) so you need sufficient counter space. As far as noise levels, fan sound volume is noticeable when running but not so loud as to be objectionable; not any louder than the fan noise from my range hood. I suppose if I had a gripe it might be that it can't set it at low a enough temperature to to do dehydrating; but I can do that in my convection oven. So far I've done fries, asparagus, zucchini, and fish cakes and these have turned out quite well. I will be doing more in the coming days - like chicken, pork schnitzel, cheese curds, sweet potato fries and calamari. If they turn out well then I suspect that this appliance may well end up with a permanent place on my counter and usage of full sized convection oven will decline. Am looking forward to experimenting with various food items to see how versatile this appliance can be."},{"reviewerName":"J. Berney","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Big capacity.

Then I found the COSORI. The external measurements weren’t much bigger that the smaller GOWISE but because of the square basket, the capacity is almost doubled.\nLove the features like the preheat setting and the presets for frozen items, veggies, etc.\nThe owners manual was detailed and very easy to understand. It was clearly written by someone who has a good command of the English language. After 50 years, our high school French and Spanish are pretty rusty, so I can’t comment on that portion of the manual. It made using a new/different appliance very straightforward.\nI especially liked the option of being able to cook for a longer time... up to 60 minutes! I first did two giant (over 8-9 inch each) russet baking potatoes (only one would fit in my 3.7 qt GOWISE). A little avocado oil on the skin, a sprinkling of sea salt and after 60 minutes at 400 they were fluffy inside with a nice crispy skin. Fantastic!\nLove love love this air fryer.\nOh yes.... the outer pan that the basket sets down into is actually metal, not plastic like many others.\nAll in all, we are very impressed with the quality and functionality of the COSORI. It boasts a powerful 1700 watt and a much longer warranty too, very reassuring.\nThere are so many brands of AF available with so many different features, it can be a real challenge to find the right one for your needs. I read reviews from recipe websites, CNET, as well as brick and mortar stores like Bed Bath & Beyond and Kohl’s, and of course, Amazon.\nVery very pleased with this purchase. It has earned a permanent place on my kitchen counter.\nMy smaller GOWISE will be hanging out in the basement along with my dozen+ slow cookers.

Buuuuuut I let the return window expire so I was stuck with it. Oops. Turns out, that was the best oops ever! After letting it sit in my dining room for months, I finally got it out about 3 weeks ago and started playing with frozen precooked things- chicken wings, hash browns, fries, etc. I felt like I couldn’t mess them up! Everything came out perfect every time. Then I graduated to cooking real food with it- whole fryer chicken, steak, shrimp, homemade fries. Even better! I think there was a fear of learning a new gadget even though I’m a pretty proficient cook. I’d say if you’re in the same boat, just do it. Just get it out and start cooking. It’s so worth it! There’s tons of online support in FB groups with recipes and cook times. The cleanup is a breeze, I just let the basket soak in warm soapy water or run it through the dishwasher. It keeps my house from getting overheated from using the oven. I didn’t believe people when they said they use theirs multiple times a day, but I’m totally there now too.

This is my 3rd Air Fryer and I believe \"Third Times the Charm.\" My first one was small and on sale, perfect to see if an air fryer is something I would use. I really liked it, but it was too small. My daughter now has that AF and I got a larger digital AF that I really loved, but it only lasted 6 months before the drip pan's non-stick surface started to peel. I NEVER put the baskets in the dishwasher, ALWAYS hand wash it, so I don't know what caused it to peel. I called the company to get a replacement outer basket and was told they don't replace anything, I would have to purchase a new AF. That is when I started searching for a new option. I found the COSORI and thought it would be perfect. It looked nice, digital, a much larger SQUARE basket, a pre-heat button AND a 2 YEAR WARRANTY!!! That warranty is the #1 reason I purchased the COSORI 5.8 quart Air Fryer. We really love this COSORI. The food taste great, the basket is large enough to fry several pieces of chicken, 2-3 steaks, an obscene amount of French fries, all with less oil than you would use in other air fryers.

Many items still require oil or cooking spray. The first couple batches of food taste funky, like factory chemicals. The cook times are longer than microwaving. It's kind of like a powerful toaster oven that cooks very evenly. The outer basket is hot, should be placed on a hot pad holder, not on the counter top after cooking. The baskets are dishwasher safe, Yay!\n\nMy first foray was to cook frozen french fries, Ore-Ida. Five minute pre-heat, five minutes cooking at 390. They came out crispy, perfectly cooked, looked great, tasted a little funky, and could have used some cooking spray.\n\nNext was frozen pizza rolls. 5 minute pre-heat, 10 minutes at 400. They were a little overdone, crunchy, tasty, the funky taste was mostly burned off the heating element in the fryer I guess. But way better than microwaving.\n\nLife just got better. Five stars.\n\nUpdate: Last night we cooked fried catfish and french fries. It was the best fried catfish I've ever had, and the fries were perfect and very tasty, without nearly as much oil as deep-frying.

It takes about 3 min to clean. We returned other brand which was very difficult to clean.\n- It makes crispy food at top and bottom sides. We tried other brand that could not make the bottom crispy.\n- It is healthy. It uses much less cooking oil and it also filters the oil from food too.\n- The cooking basket is big. 5.8Q\n- It is easy to use with touch screen.\n- It is convenient. You may walk away when cooking with Air Fryer and come back a few min later. Food will be ready. If the food is not well done as you like, add 2-3 more min to cook again. It is very easy to control to cook food to the texture/look you like.\n- No strong frying odor in kitchen as in regular baking/frying. We put the Air Fryer next to range hood. No strong odor left after air-frying pork belly, bacon. Making crispy food without getting strong frying odor in kitchen.\n\nCons:\n- The fan is little bit loud. I guess it is a common problem with many Air Fryer.\n\nThe plastic smell goes away after using for 2-3 times.\n\nHighly recommend this COSORI Air Fryer."},{"reviewerName":"joel Bradford","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Crapped out in less than 4 months","reviewDate":"The manufacturer commented on the review below","reviewText":"While I loved this air fryer while it lasted.

I finally started to research it via videos and amazon written reviews. This product in my opinion had the most glowing reviews. I am a very busy person and was looking for a way to quickly prepare dinner for the family. When I finally got my Cosori air fryer, I used it the same day and made some wings. It came out great nice, crispy, juicy tender, and golden!\nWhen the box arrived it was not in an amazon box and I later learned that you have the option to ship it that way. The box was a bit damaged, whereby there was a hole created along an 8 inch indented tear. When I opened it the air fryer was protected by the packaging and not damaged. The cook book, instructions and other pieces of info were supposed to be in a zip loc bag but they were displaced out of the bag. I thought for a moment that I mistakingly got a used/previously sold product, or it was not handled properly, and was considering sending it back, but the Airfryer was not used/damaged in any way. It was my first time receiving an amazon order that was not in the amazon box, just the product box.\nOverall, I am looking forward to making more dishes with my Cosori Air Fryer. It passed my chicken wing test, and everyone-including a skeptical husband, a picky 7 year old, and two amazed elderly women-enjoyed them. I'm sure it will no doubt be a staple when it comes to making other quicker, healthier meals."},{"reviewerName":"Doug - TMO","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Amazing, It Just Works!","reviewDate":"September 29, 2019","reviewText":"Opened the box and within 25 minutes had the best steak fries I have ever made at home. During the next 10 days I used the air fryer everyday each time with the amazing results of simply delicious. The air fryer just works! Works as shown in the videos, reviews, and recipe book. Each to follow instructions, simple to setup, easy to clean (I use the lower rack in the dishwasher, just remember to take it out to air dry to avoid issues with trapped water in the metal), and easy to use. COMMENT: The first 4-5 uses will produce a 'plastic' and 'slight burning' smell/taste, but completely disappears on the 5-6 use of the air fryer. The \"crispiness\" is easily achieved with some changes in the \"shake\". I do four (4) shakes per cooking cycle, not the recommended two (2) shakes. Those reviews that comment about the space this unit take is a bit over blown, especially when compared to a typically oil fryer, this unit takes less space and no oil mess!\nCOMMENT TO COROSI: I suggest adding a setting \"Number of Shakes\" to allow the user to program 2, 4, or 6 shakes so the Shake Alarm will be triggered more often, at my discretion.\nIf you want an Air Fryer that work and produces an amazing results, Cosori 5.8 Qt.

So much for paying for Amazon Prime. I will be dropping Amazon Prime. 50% of my packages have been late or never came in past 2 months. It started since they have been trying to deliver their own packages and bypassing normal shipping vendors. What a nosedive in service. Its like they don't care anymore. When you call them, all they have to say oh it will be late and no sincere apologies or compensation to make up for the constant mistakes. The product is nice looking especially the display which is easy to use. I did make one recipe from their book with some chicken wings, and they did cook all the way through however the crispyness was not on the whole wing just parts. Bu the part that was fried had a good taste to it, like fried chicken. I guess i when you shake them halfway, maybe that is not good enough. I sense you have to turn over each one yourself individually to ensure they all get crisp? Will try that next time. The size was kind small inside considering i ordered the xtra large size. Do not think this could a big dinner for a family. maybe for 1 or 2 ppl at most. The size is just not there. Also guessing you can't really stack things like wings on top of each other to cook more. They probably won't all cook evenly. Cleanup seemed simple. Will have to try some more recipes and get used to the air fryer to see if it does other stuff well.

It does a great job making food taste fried without all the calories. My favorite use is cooking tater tots. Preheat to finish is about 15 minutes.

I have owned and used my Corsori 5.8 qt Air Fryer since Prime Days 2019. After the first couple uses, I moved my electric grill and my convection oven out to a shelf in the garage. We are a family of two. This air fryer is the perfect size for us. We have cooked chicken, hamburgers, pizza, baked potato, made toast, and several other dishes in it, and we are well pleased with it. We cooked eggs, but I have yet to get those quite right. I am sure it will just take some practice. For us, this was a game changer. We have more counter space now, and it is just too easy to pop something in the Cosori, push a couple of buttons, and go on to make the salad. It's small compared to our convection oven and seems to do most things that the convection oven would do, quicker and with less external heat. I don't know that we would have been as happy with a smaller one, even for just the two of us. We like having the space for the air to flow and the space to cook more than one thing at a time without crowding.

Then all of a sudden, it would shut off randomly in the middle of cooking. I assumed it was the overheat function kicking in so I would wait a few minutes then attempt to turn it back on. It would do it from time to time then a few days after that the buttons stopped working, or would change randomly during the cooking cycle. I contacted Amazon, and they quickly sent me a replacement. It wasn't too long after I began using the replacement that it started doing the SAME THING. I reached out to Cosori customer support and explained the issue thinking that it had to be something I was doing to cause it to behave this way. They assured me that I was doing everything correctly, and that the unit shouldn't be acting so strange. They were quick to replace the replacement that I received from Amazon and so far I haven't had any problems. Sure, it was a rocky start, but I am in love with this air fryer. I use it to cook everything from salmon, and chicken breast to pre-cooked frozen French fries and chicken nuggets and everything turns out beautifully. I know there are some negative reviews that are similar to mine but it could just be something defective in the batch that Amazon received - who knows. I have purchased many kitchen gadgets and this is by far my favorite. I use it every day, sometimes multiple times a day. If you are on the fence, go ahead and buy it. My story is the exception - not the rule.

I did frozen French fries and chunked up some chicken breast and lightly breaded them mix of cornstarch, Parmesan cheese garlic and oregano and bread crumbs. Everything came out perfect! Crispy fries and chicken that was crispy and juicy inside. The fries took about 10 minutes and the chicken took 8 minutes! My husband loved it all. This will get tons of use here. He couldn’t believe there was less than a teaspoon of oil when all was done. The preheat and all the other preset functions take a lot of guess work away. And the thing really is quiet! I also love the safety feature of not being able to accidentally separate the baskets. Smart idea!\nThis was a great Mother’s Day gift for me. Worth every cent! I’d definitely recommend it.

Despite being clean this thing stunk pretty bad the first three times I pre heated it. So much so I was afraid a smoke alarm was going to go off. You could see a light cloud in the kitchen - had to open windows. Again there was nothing inside / burnt this was purely off gassing.\n\nOther than that - this thing is amazing. Easy to use cooks SUPER fast. I've had to experiment a bit with the temps and cooking times - so far using the recommendations in the included book seem to be overkill making most foods far too crispy (nearing burnt) for my taste. This relates to all frozen pre prepped foods (french fries, poppers, crispy chicken etc.) It's nice however to be able to cook these foods in roughly HALF the time listed on the bag using a conventional oven.\n\nIn short it cooks fast, the controls are easy to use, and super easy to clean.

The digital display is simple, once you get use to toggling back and forth between temperature and time. It’s convenient to check doneness while cooking because when you pull out the basket, it automatically pauses, then resumes when you re-insert the basket. In the 2-weeks I’ve had it, I’ve made French-fries, roasted chic-peas, an egg bake (using the cake barrel in the accessory set I also ordered), chicken breasts, pork chops, salmon filets and salmon cakes.

The digital touch screen is really easy to learn how to operate. Very easy to clean, i love the fact that the basket can completely separate for easy shaking and cleaning. It cooks very tasty food. I use it everyday since i got it. My only real complaint is the basket can be difficult to get in and out. You have to hold on to the machine and the handle to get the basket out at times ..i hope it doesn't break it ,that can be frustrating but other than that it's an awesome cooking device...i love it and it looks really nice on my counter! Just be careful with the recipes I've noticed some things cook quicker than the recipes time suggested but there's some really delicious recipes in the book. I'm hoping it ]continues to make me glad to cook again.

A lil spritz of olive oil and seasonings of choice, pop into the fryer, 15 min one side, flip, 12 mun other side...deliciously moist inside, crispy outside yumminess.

Once familiar with how it works, it is easy! We started out with what we a considered fail-free food: french fries. We have made them at least a gazillion times now, with a variety of seasonings and they came out perfect every time. Next, we nervously decided to try a dry-aged 3+ inch steak. We seasoned it with salt and pepper, sprayed the baskets and set the pre-set controls. It was delicious! Cooked to perfection - medium rare. Next we tried thick pork chops and last night airline chicken breasts. The meat in all three preparations was by far the juiciest and most tender we've had. Granted, we used a high quality cut of meat each time, but the differences between results with the air fryer and conventional cooking are truly exceptional. Last weekend we did breaded chicken tenders with parmesan cheese and they, too, came out perfect. We are extremely pleased with this product and looking forward to getting more adventuresome."},{"reviewerName":"Tracy","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Easy to Use","reviewDate":"September 1, 2019","reviewText":"I bought this gem on Amazon Prime Day because I've been wanting an Air Fryer for some time. I finally got a chance to use it over the last two weeks. I've made Shishito Peppers, Chile Relleno, Salmon and Mexican Corn. I wanted to try something different instead of the traditional wings and chicken everybody seems to make.\n\nThe appliance looks pretty sleek and the operation is fairly simple. It jut seems intimidating because it is a different way of cooking. The menu appears after sticking in the fryer basket and it is locked into place which i think is a great safety pre-caution.\n\nThe basket is quite large and i do not anticipate having any concerns cooking whatever I want.

It has seemed slightly loose most of the time I’ve had it, but it did not seem to be a problem in functionality until I noticed break today. When I cook things that have to shake I have noticed it seemed slightly loose for quite a while, but I only noticed the break today while cleaning it, which implies this may have been cracked in an unnoticeable place very shortly after purchase or all along. I have mostly cooked wings and other things that need to be shaken halfway through the cooking cycle, which based on the damage I am seeing now does not seem to be a great idea for this given how it is connected.

I only bought it because it was on sale for Prime Days. But I have to say, i'm pretty impressed and have been using it a lot in the past couple week. My take on the \"fried food\" part of it, is that it's somewhere between baked and fried. The crust you get from deep frying is there, but it's a little dryer (which is obvious because of lack of oil). But the inside stays the same consistency as if you basked it (so fairly moist). It's much better tasting than baking but not quite as good as deep frying (but come on, what do you expect miracles!). But there's so much more to do than just a substitute fryer... I've cooked hot dog, carrots and even reheated pizza. All came out great.\n\nIt's also so easy to clean. The basket is dishwasher safe, which is nice. But with the non-stick coating it's so simple to clean in the sink, that I never bother taking up space in the dishwasher.\n\nMy only pet peeve is the pre-heat functionality. You can set the temperature you want to pre-heat to, but once it's done pre-heating the device resets back to the default temperate (i think 400 or something). Why wouldn't it stay set to the preheat temperature?

We've owned about a month now and have tried several of the recipies from the book that came with, all very easy and tasty! Pinterest is also FULL of air fryer recipies we have saved to try. The only draw back is the for a family of five the time savings is less because you must cook in two batches and this is among the largest air fryers. You must double the cooking time as there may be only room to cook three large chicken breasts, as they need space for the air to circulate. Not a big deal, but instead of 25 mins, you must plan for 50 mins for two batches...that said, it still uses less power and does not heat up the kitchen like using the regular oven and because you're not using grease, must healthier!"},{"reviewerName":"cambella","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"REALLY EASY TO USE AND CLEAN","reviewDate":"June 11, 2019","reviewText":"Just purchased two of the 5.8 qt Cosori AirFryer's via Amazon. I kept one for myself and gifted the other one to my niece. I have purchased other brand AirFryer's and so far this one is my favorite, because it is so easy to use and also to clean. It is very stylish looking but still has plenty of surface cooking room. My only complaint is the airfryer I gave my niece lost one of two tiny screws that was in the grease catcher pan. The screw fell out and fell down the drain in her sink. Not sure what can be done.\nFollowup: Contacted Support site via email, replied the next day, excellent customer service, will be shipping me a replacement outer basket.

I cook beyond meat patties in it. Home made sweet potato fries. It's simple to use and easy to clean. Much like any appliance or tool the factory settings are more a suggestion than the absolute. You still have to learn the time duration of items and check in on what's cooking. The shake reminder is nice. For instance it has a \"frozen\" setting, if you cook fish sticks to the suggested time they will be dried out and potentially burnt. Sweet potato fried need to be \"shaken\" multiple times to come out completely even because they are in a pile inside it. I throw Trader Joe's meatless ground in, and with about 1 to 2 minutes left toss a few corn tortillas in and they curl up and crisp a bit."},{"reviewerName":"minderbinder","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Really Love It","reviewDate":"May 9, 2019","reviewText":"This is my first air fryer, so I don't have another to compare it to, but I can honestly say that I love this one. I've used it for three nights now, and every time has been a raging success. I took a safe route and made cheese/tomato omelettes on the first night, and they poofed up so pretty I took a picture and posted it to Facebook. Second night, I breaded chicken tenders and onion rings. No, they couldn't have been confused with deep-fried, but they were excellent, maybe better, than deep-fried. Third night, I made both french fries and sweet potato french fries. Again, excellent. The intuitive touch pad was a huge plus, I never once had to refer to the manual.

Luckily both times we were cooking something the screw couldn't stick to like buffalo wings or that it could sink into like Cosori's air fryer cheese dip. I cringe thinking about biting into this screw because it is stuck to my food or mixed into it.\n\nThe screw comes out of the front of the drip tray . The first time it happened was in May a month after I got it. I reinstalled the screw, tightened as tight as I thought I could without stripping it and then continued to use it. I contacted Cosori at that time and received this message:\n\n\"We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused, as this is not a normal occurrence. If you have not already, please feel free to check the other screws.\"\n\nNow 3 months later the same screw came back out. Maybe I have a defective unit that can't hold the screw but with it happening twice in the 4 months that I've had it, I feel like it is only a matter of time before we end up biting a screw. I don't want to have to inspect my air fryer after every item I cook to see if all the screws are still in place and not in my food."},{"reviewerName":"B.

I couldn't be more pleased with this purchase. It come with a cookbook which is very helpful, but keep in mind cookbooks with appliances are guides not an exact reference. I have now cooked steak, bone in pork chops, biscuits, fries, tuna burgers, and more. You can easily cook for one or two and what a joy to not heat up your kitchen by having to use the stove. The steaks, pork chops, and tuna burgers were moist and incredibly flavorful. I fixed two sirloin steaks by the directions in the cookbook plus one minute by the cookbook they will come out medium. For pork chops I lowered the temp and took 2 minutes off the time. I made canned biscuits at 320 for 8 minutes, keep in mind smaller than an oven so you must lower the temp and time. For fries I promise you the recipe is calling for two baking size potatoes so you have to keep an eye on it. The clean up couldn't be easier, you can literally wipe it clean, and it is non stick.

I have had it for a month so far and my husband and I have used it for many things. We’ve made salmon, hamburgers, asparagus, broccoli, tater tots, pizza rolls, steak, chicken breast, breaded chicken tenders, homemade french fries, dried chickpeas, bacon, and I’m sure I’m missing more. The only thing I probably wouldn’t do again is the salmon because I like when lemon juice bakes into the fish while in the oven versus that crunchy-on-the-outside texture you get with the air fryer. But that’s exactly what I wanted with the chicken tenders, tater tots, pizza rolls, etc. This is convenient, the clean up is easy, cooking times are less than other cooking means, and we’ve enjoyed ours immensely. We don’t have much counter space so we store it with our other appliances in the pantry and it’s easy to take out when we want to use it.

We’ve cooked pork, fish, chicken breasts, wings and veggies. Just like I prepare them in the oven. The fryer cooks much more quickly, the food has been amazing, cleanup is a cinch, and it has to be using less energy since its not a full size oven heating up the house and is on half the time.

Make sure to cool it before cleaning, to avoid damaging the coating. And yes, it is Teflon (whatever. As long as it’s not peeling). So far I have cooked pork loin, sweet potato fries and frozen salmon fillets. All turned out great. Cooking is not odorless. I’m glad I have a vent hood in my kitchen.

I have made a whole chicken (very juicy), chicken wings, baked potatoes (awesome crispy skins) and fries, fries and more fries. My only negative comment would be that the temperatures/presets tend to run too hot. I always have to manually adjust the temps/times for what I'm cooking. If I cooked fries per the pre-set button or by the recipe booklet that came with it, they would be severely over done.

This air fryer is a game changer. I use it daily for all sorts of things and HIGHLY recommend the accessories that are sold separately. The 5.8 QT version is perfect for 2-3 people. The food odors vent out to the room when in use and smelling chicken wings, for example, being air fried is gross but oh well."},{"reviewerName":"Natto J.","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"All I love to cook.","reviewDate":"July 19, 2019","reviewText":"I was skeptical to buy cosori fryer. We are a very healthy conscious family and often buy things related to kitchen and food after great lengthy research. My friends suggested me different brands but none told me about cosori. But after my search on Amazon and other websites I came to know this cosori brand. I needed 5.8 quartz size and also with high heat settings. Last but not least cosori was my choice and now whenever I use it I am very happy with my purchase. Easy to clean, easy to move from cabinet, easy to operate and processes food greatly. Taste is never compromised though it's an air fryer."},{"reviewerName":"Bob P","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Now We're Cookin'","reviewDate":"March 20, 2019","reviewText":"Used it for a few things so far and worked well on each. Saved pre-heating the oven time to bake potatoes and baked it faster than the oven would with nice crisp skin. Just lukewarm air venting out the back. Could barely feel it with my hand very close to the back. Actually a little quieter than a microwave. Did some frozen Weaver Chicken patties and they came out a little dryer than frying, but I didn't have to clean up the oil spatters on the glass stove top."},{"reviewerName":"Shemarley","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"This product is the best!

It is true, timing and temps just like any other oven may differ. So test until you get what works for you. Made delish tater tots tender and crunchy. McDonald like French fries also delish. We went with 400 temp 6 min shake then 6 min again. Frozen chicken wings came out ok, meat was tender skin was somewhat crunchy. Def cooks them faster than the conventional oven. Still working to perfect them, but I am fussy when it comes to my wings. My honey liked them :).

It quickly became the center point for cooking in our home. However, the most important element of any useful product is quality. It has to last a reasonable amount of time. Last night I was preparing some chicken wings. When I removed the basket from the fryer, the handle broke and the basket dumped chicken all over the kitchen floor. Upon inspecting the handle, it had heat fractures all around the attachment point. I bought this fryer ten months ago (February 2019). Fortunately, I can order a replacement basket from Amazon (21% of the cost of the fryer).

I place it on my flat top stove fearing that it would emits too much heat but it still cool to touch. Now, not saying that you can be carefree and not use caution.

Digital readout. Various presets—which can be tweaked. Shake feature. Very Easy to clean (very happy about this). Basket is dishwasher safe. Acceptably loud. Large capacity. No bad smells (as some have reported). Reasonably priced.\n\nDislikes: drawer is not easy to open. Eject button on handle not easy to press. 10 degree temperature increments—would like to see 5, instead.\n\nI have nothing else to compare it to, but my wife and I are pleased with the purchase. Works well for us."},{"reviewerName":"minerva","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Yumm","reviewDate":"July 13, 2019","reviewText":"Nice looking, pretty quick\nBest chicken nuggets and fries update, i had to return it as it over heats\nAfter 10 min working, amazon was very helpful in processing the refund"},{"reviewerName":"Kevin","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great Product","reviewDate":"September 23, 2019","reviewText":"This air fryer works great.

So far, have done fries, dry rub chicken wings (pictured,) and garlic bread. Pleasantly surprised at just how easy it was and how good everything turned out. One thing I really appreciate about this thing is that even though it has a substantial 5.8 cooking capacity, the footprint of the appliance really isn't that big. Smaller than many other brands that offer much less basket room. Plus it all feels very solid/high quality and looks pretty sleek sitting on the countertop too! Also appreciate that the company offers an additional free warranty year when you register it.

It's simple, quick & tasty.\nI sprinkle the seasoning https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Byrons-Barbecue-Seasoning-Byron/dp/B01K86F6LI on chicken thighs (bone-in with skin), airfry in my Phillips at 350° for approx 30 minutes to a temp of 180-189°. I know that's higher than needed, but we think the thighs taste better cooked to this temp.\n\nI decided to use Cosori's chicken preset to cook 4 thighs. The preset temp was 380° for 25 minutes. As an added bonus (well, in my mind a bonus) because the Cosori is so large, halfway through I moved the thighs to the corners & added 2 medium potatoes to the open center area of the pan -- the potatoes were cut into eighths &coated with appox 2 tsp. olive oil, & seasoned with salt & pepper.\nAs a side note: 2 thighs were large & 2 were medium...I prefer using smaller thighs because we think they taste better, so normally I wouldn't use large thighs.\nWe could hardly wait for the chicken to be done...and finally the taste test...well, I was shocked that the thighs weren't as crispy & actually not even as flavorful, as the ones I normally make in the Phillips. Granted 2 of them were large, but even the 2 medium thighs weren't as tasty. Basically, we agreed that the thighs tasted like they'd been baked in an oven. Not bad at all, but just not as good as the ones I make in my Phillips. I'm not sure why this happened, and will be trying another batch when I purchase more thighs.\n\nToday, I decided to try frozen foods...again because the basket is so much larger, I was able to airfry 2 gluten free, breaded chicken tenders & a serving of (frozen) sweet potato fries at the same time. This was enough for my hubby. This time I chose to cook manually & airfried both of them at 400° for 10 minutes. Both came out crispy & tasty. I might've been able to cook for less time.\nFor myself I decided to roast frozen broccoli & cauliflower. This is something I never made in the Phillips so a first for me. I only made one serving, there was room for plenty more; I coated the frozen veggies with a small amount of olive oil probably less than a tsp, airfried at 400° for 10 min. (which might've been a bit too long, but was delicious). Going by most info I found online, I thought I was going to have to cook the veggies for 20 min. I'm sure glad I checked them at the 10 min. mark because the broccoli florets were black on the tips, any longer & they'd have been ruined. As it was, I sprinkled everything with salt & garlic powder & enjoyed absolutely delicious roasted broccoli & cauliflower. I also made myself a breaded chicken patty that took about the same amount of time. Next time I'll try cooking them together. Everything was crispy & tasty.\n\nI'm going to try baked fish next. I'll loosely wrap a fish filet in aluminum foil, add seasonings & airfry. It won't take long. In the past I've made meat loaf, au-gratin potatoes, scones, glazed ham, pork chops & more in an airfryer. One of these days, i\"m going to try donuts made from canned biscuits...you can find lots of ideas online.\n\nHow does the Cosori compare to the Phillips?\n--Well, I don't have to preheat the Phillips...and actually forgot to preheat the Cosori today. I did preheat for the chicken thighs.\n--Cosori 'Keep Warm' is 5 minutes long; Phillips is 30 min. & I've used every minute. However, it's simple enough to keep selecting 'Keep Warm' until you're ready to serve the meal. The 'Keep Warm' feature is important because it helps keep the food crispy. I like that both airfryers have that setting.\n--The Cosori automatically turns itself off when the pan is pulled out during the cooking cycle...what's great is that when the pan is put back in, Cosori automatically returns to the temp & remaining cooking time. My Phillips continues to run when I pull out the pan.\n--Cosori has several preset options. My Phillips has a few. I typically don't use presets, but it's convenient for those who do.\n--The Cosori takes up a bit more counter space, but of course, it's a larger airfryer. I think for its size that it doesn't take up much space. Cosori = 11\" x 10\" x 12 3/4\" H ...... Phillips = 10\" x 9\" x 11\" H.\n--The Cosori has built in hand grips on its base...Wow, it makes moving it much easier. The airfryer isn't heavy, but I like using the hand grips. My Phillips doesn't have any.\n--Cleaning - both cooking pans, etc. can be put in the dishwasher...okay that's easy. I always pour out the grease that's in the bottom of the pan & wipe the pan out before putting it in the dishwasher...most of the time, I clean my Phillips in the sink. Phillips is easier to clean manually than the Cosori, because the bottom screen pushes out & the sides of the 'cooking pan' are smooth, also the handle comes off so it's not as bulky to clean. The Cosori 'cooking pan' is vented along the sides & base, there are 3 screws that protrude out which haven't caused me any cleaning issues for me yet, but might in the future & the handle does not come off. I'm not going to be cleaning it manually very often, but the two pieces take up most of the dishwasher's bottom rack.\n--Both come with a great user manual & handy cookbooks. There are several recipes in Cosori's cookbook that sound very good.\n--Cosori has a 2 year warranty...be sure to sign up for it within the first 2 weeks of purchase.\n--Cosori is priced to sell...very reasonably priced. The Phillips, even though smaller, is quite a bit more.\n\nI put off getting an airfryer for years because I thought it would be the same as using an oven; I was wrong, foods come out crispier & usually take less cooking time. I'm an airfryer convert & admit when I've been wrong.\n\nFrom my experience so far, I like the Cosori & hope my next batch of chicken thighs seasoned with Butt Rub comes out as crispy & tasty as those I airfry in my Phillips. Everything else I've airfried in the Cosori has been very tasty.\n\nA few tips:\n--Airfrying bacon can get messy, the grease spatters up to the burner coil. I didn't airfry bacon in the Cosori & had to wipe down the cooking element/burner at the top of the Phillips because the bacon grease caused quite a bit of smoking when I airfried other foods. By the way, I suggest you take time to clean that coil periodically because fats do spatter onto it. Wait for the unit to cool & use a damp cloth or paper towel, even a dry paper towel will get rid of most of the grease. There might be times when you'll need to use a soapy cloth. In my opinion, keeping the heating element free of grease will save you from enduring some smoky cooking experiences.\n--Adding a tablespoon of water or more to the bottom pan will help prevent smoke too.\n--If you're a newbie to airfrying, I suggest you cook items for less time, then check to see if you should add more minutes. It's easier to add more minutes than to ruin a meal by overcooking it.\n--You can use parchment paper & aluminum foil in the air fryer. Just be sure there is food on top of it, or the air turbulence could send that paper up to the cooking element which might start a fire."},{"reviewerName":"Holly Lee","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Gets hot","reviewDate":"January 5, 2019","reviewText":"Incredibly easy to use.

Two of us worked with it so we could learn how to use it. (Ah, you have to toggle the time/temp switch.) We made shrimp--perfectly crisp and tasty--said the shrimp lover. (We made a note of the brand and type on the shopping list.) I made French fries--thin cut--with help. (We shook the basket--no flipping. The mode we chose didn't give us the Shake command, but we're still experimenting with the modes. We'll be making the shrimp and fries again and other foods, and I plan to try reheating fries from restaurants that usually get tossed.\n\nWe used aluminum foil to cut down on the cleaning of the baskets--and, of course, there are no dirty pans to wash now (I like that because i'm the dish washer), and we used Pam olive oil spray on the aluminum foil to give us the extra oil needed for crispiness. I gave the baskets a light washing before using them because I worried about rinsing them thoroughly if I immersed them in soapy water, so I probably picked up some of that residual smell that comes with new things like toasters.\n\nWe don't have room on our little counters, but it fits on the kitchen cart, and we wheel it over to the closest outlet. We are more enthusiastic about our air fryer than we expected, and we'll check out those recipes.\n\nI haven't come across the country of origin yet."},{"reviewerName":"KWJ","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"AN EXCELLENT FAMILY-SIZED AIR FRYER","reviewDate":"January 9, 2019","reviewText":"I recently jumped on the air-frying bandwagon and there really is no going back. Why air fry? I never even REGULAR fried, so I didn't realize I needed one. Turns out I did and here's why: Just about anything I baked in the oven could be done much faster in the air fryer, with better results, AND easier cleanup. As a mom of two small kids, that's a huge plus. I use ours for everything from frozen chicken nuggets to crispy brussell sprouts. This is our second air fryer - the first was a smaller unit from a Chinese company I have never heard of.\n\nPROS:\n- Cosori customer service. Register this right away and they will give you a two year warranty. Our Cosori pressure cooker needed service once and they were very responsive.\n- Large basket for more food. This is the biggest basket we've used. It's deep and square - many are shallow and circular.\n- Not as huge as you'd think! It holds twice as much as our last one but is only about 25% bigger.\n- Sleek appearance. Not that it matters greatly - we store our unit in a cabinet - but they put some thought into the looks.\n- Higher temperature range - our last unit went to 390, this one goes to 400.\n- If you want more info on the pros of air frying in general, Google that. I won't waste your time with that here - but trust me, you need one.\n\nCONS:\n- The flimsy plastic basket release button. I don't get it - it's not consistent with the quality of the rest of the product. It doesn't seem durable and I'm not expecting it to last as long as the rest of the machine.\n- The digital control. I don't like that you have to toggle between temperature and time - it's just a bit cumbersome. Our last unit let me adjust time with one touch.\n- None of these cons are deal breakers, but worth knowing.\n\nOverall, this is an awesome unit and I highly recommend it. Cosori hasn't let me down yet. I think we'll be using this thing for years."},{"reviewerName":"lb2472","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great Customer Service","reviewDate":"July 15, 2019","reviewText":"I brought this as a gift form my mother who initially left it in the box for 45 days before opening to use it.

Even after thoroughly washing the baskets, the fumes get baked into the foods (brussels sprouts, chicken, etc.) causing them to have nauseous flavour. The fun doesn't stop there!

There are some round racks available, but you will loose space and this unit is not huge to start with, so loosing any space would be a detriment."},{"reviewerName":"Shawn R","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Love this air fryer","reviewDate":"July 24, 2019","reviewText":"The large size of this fryer makes it pretty simple to prepare side dishes for a bigger family. We have a family of six and can cook a enough fries or potato logs for all of us in 2 batches. The recipes in the included cook book are great! I highly recommend the Parmesan Potato Wedges, we had to take 2 minutes off of the frying time or they were a little too done for our liking but after that adjustment, we love them! This fryer also does bacon wonderfully and all of the grease drains away!\n\nSuper easy to clean and easy enough to operate that my 6 year old can cook with it!\n\nHighly recommend!"},{"reviewerName":"Arwen in NM","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"DING DING DING! We have a winner","reviewDate":"March 13, 2019","reviewText":"The unit looks great. That may not be a lot to most, but I want my appliances to look nice. Speaking of, the cookbook that comes with this is a lot more than I expected. WOW.\n\nI was impressed by how well the instructions were done. Too often the technical writer isn't cohesive or leaves things out. Not this one! Exceptionally easy to use.\n\nDo be aware that the cord is a bit short. I'm seeing this a lot more in countertop appliances. Probably because of all of you who trip over the wires. :D\n\nAll in all, this is nice to have. It cooks. It is easy to clean (let's handwash, okay?) And it looks nice. Hits all the bells for me."},{"reviewerName":"Girlfriends","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Read the user manual BEFORE using! It always pays to be safe!","reviewDate":"July 19, 2019","reviewText":"I love my RED Cosori 5.8 qt. Air-Fryer! First night: homemade French fries. Second night: the first batch of chicken breast cut into bite sized pieces BURNED. It didn’t smell up the kitchen or prompt me to call the fire department but boy, was I careful with the second batch! Lowered the temp and decreased the time and hit pause a couple times to CHECK on it! It was a success! So, my note to self and recommendation to all is don’t be afraid to hit pause and check on your food! At least if you’re a newbie to this product. I’m having fun with mine! I ❤️ LOVE my new air fryer! AND I love the 100 recipes that came with it! That is what prompted me to buy the Cosori in the first place! On page 5 and 6 of recipe book: suggested times for food. Consult with it! It will be your best friend as you navigate the newness of it all!"},{"reviewerName":"skyone","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great air fryer - looks great on my counter","reviewDate":"July 5, 2019","reviewText":"We really love this air fryer. It's a larger size basket, which is better than the circular/egg-shaped air fryers, yet it doesn't take up a huge space on the counter. In fact, we replaced our toaster oven which took up more space than this beauty. Not only does the air fryer toast well (380° for 3 minutes = perfect toast), it can do so much more. We use it every single day. I love the digital temperature for accurate settings, and the presets are also helpful. Cleanup is a snap. Just a wet paper towel and you're ready for your next meal. The set comes with a very nice recipe book. These recipes weren't just thrown together like many free recipe books are; they are filled with practical and useful recipes we will actually make. The wings recipe in the book turned out fantastic!"},{"reviewerName":"S.

I decided to go with Cosori due to the reviews and also the ease of cleaning. It has a good size square basket and nothing sticks. I can tell you this is the best machine in my kitchen now! I love it, food cooks thoroughly and deliciously. No hot kitchen! Clean up is a breeze. Most proud of the sticky chicken wings and personal home made pizza pictured above! I will also be taking this along in the RV!

My last air fryer didn't have any of these so it was just a dial for temperature. I especially like the square basket, so much better than the round basked (to me).

All I used was salt and pepper to season and 5 minutes at 350, plus the 5 minute preheat made the entree cook faster than the sides! Clean up was quick and easy, despite not having a dishwasher.
