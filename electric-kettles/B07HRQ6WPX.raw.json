Eskanazy","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Nice kettle","reviewDate":"December 2, 2016","reviewText":"Aesthetically this electric kettle is quite nice. I've been using it for about one month now, on average 4-6 times a day. I use for making instant coffee , teas, coffee press, chicory, and heating water for cooking. My previous electric kettle was stainless steel model that lasted about 3 years before the heating element died.\n\nPositive features as follows. I like that there is no plastic, other than a silicone lid seal. Heating element is stainless and the rest is ceramic. It heats quickly as most of these kettles do. The switch lights blue during heating and will make a soft click when water has reached a boil and it shuts off. If you remove the kettle during heating phase and then return it to the base it will continue to heat the water. ( my previous units all shut off when removed from the base). This is not a negative necessarily but good to know especially if you're not used to this detail.\n\nSome features I'm not so happy with are are follows:\nnot too easy to fill through the spout so I have to remove lid each time.\n\nBlue color doesn't appear to be a ceramic glaze but rather some kind of paint that I suspect may fade/ peel over time. There is also a min. / max indicators 'painted' on the inside.\n\nAfter pouring there will inevitably be some water dripping along the spout.\n\nDespite these minor disappointments I still recommmend this kettle. Although I can't comment yet on longevity, I do suspect this will last a long time. The build quality is superior.\n\nUpdate: Having used this kettle for 5 months straight, I have had no issues. It continues to work flawlessly. The design (blue color) has not faded or chipped off. It can be a little tricky to clean especially at spout and small drain holes. Luckily having a water softener makes this an infrequent need. A little baking soda and vinegar will do the trick. I've increased my rating to a 5 since I really am quite fond of this kettle."},{"reviewerName":"Kamil","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"this kettle is beautiful and works great","reviewDate":"June 5, 2018","reviewText":" first off, this kettle is beautiful and works great.

Abbamondi","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"I Cracked the Leaking Mystery!","reviewDate":"December 21, 2017","reviewText":"Like some others here have commented, I noticed a pool of water beneath my kettle the first two times I used it. Weird, I thought. I ALMOST returned it. But then, I figured something out that I hope will spare others the pain of believing they must return this otherwise perfect kitchen necessity.\n\nTurns out that the \"max\" line indicated for water level inside the pitcher is NOT the line you should fill to. Instead, if you fill with water to a point falling between the indicated \"max\" and \"min\" lines, then your tea kettle will no longer \"leak.\" Nevermind any bitter thoughts on how an item should work without us having to muddle out its quirks. Manufacturers, like the rest of us, are imperfect. But if you can get over this teensy flaw, you get to keep an otherwise delightful and useful tea kettle.\n\nThe only other thing I should mention is that it is quite heavy, so your little ones and some elderly will have a lot of difficulty wielding it. For the rest of us, we get a bicep bonus workout! Oh, goody!"},{"reviewerName":"MR & Mrs D.A.

It now takes almost 7 minutes to boil. Today I went to put the lid back on and the handle snapped off the lid. I bought a warranty with Assurion when I purchased it through Amazon so I called them, they said the manufacturers warranty is still good for 1 year so I called Bella- they said they are out of lids and that I should call them in about 4 weeks...in the meantime I can't get the lid off my kettle to fill it!..... What type of customer service is that!? I asked if the fact that they are out of lids might reflect that this is a manufacturing flaw to which they had no response. I asked for an entirely new kettle since I was not willing to wait 4 weeks and they said no, absolutely the worst customer service experience that I have ever had.

I purchased the blue model about two years ago and had no problems with it whatsoever. Unfortunately, I was groggily making tea one morning and accidentally bumped the kettle into the side of the sink, breaking the spout. I do not see this as a manufacturing defect, just my stupidity. Of course it could chip/crack/break if handled improperly; it's ceramic!\n\nI'm on my second kettle, the silver model, and have been using it three times a day, every day and have not had one hiccup. The water gets good and hot, but not so hot that you'll burn your tea leaves. It boils pretty fast. I fill it up first thing in the morning, and then go about prepping the rest of my breakfast. It's usually done in a matter of minutes.\n\nI drink out of normalish size mugs and get about three servings out of a max fill. If you have smaller mugs or need more room for milk, you'd get more servings. When I use a French press to make coffee for guests, I fill the kettle to the max fill line and usually have a little water left over in the kettle after filling the French press.\n\nI do notice a little discoloration, likely from mineral deposits, on the stainless steel heating element on the bottom of the inside of the kettles. I'll soon fill the kettle with vinegar overnight and let the vinegar do it's magic on the mineral deposits.\n\nIt is a heavy kettle compared to other electric kettles I've used. I wouldn't recommend for people with weak wrists, hands, or arthritic issues."},{"reviewerName":"Rabbit","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Good thing that it wasn't full of boiling water","reviewDate":"April 4, 2017","reviewText":"Purchased June 2016.

And then I saw it would sweat as it heated up the water and so much so that it would puddle onto the counter. Such a hazard.

I get it, sometimes great products have failures. It was outside of Amazon return timeframe and the exchange process with Bella is a hassle. Mail in 2\" of the power cord of the base (it is an extra wide cord and you need more than scissors), the silver sticker and a printed receipt that shows the order date to Quebec AND THEN Bella ships a replacement kettle. I told the representative I was disappointed in the process. And I asked the representative if I would have to fill out a customs form because of the 2\" of cord and she said no. The post office did in fact make me fill out a customs form for an unusable piece of cord and charged me $10.\n\nMy recommendation to Bella is that they trust their customers and lose the requirement of sending 2\" of the power cord which is a) hard to cut without tools and b) creates a $10 shipment and customers form for those in the US.\n\nI suppose I will eventually receive a replacement but am shopping for something else - I will not be buying another Bella product. Too much hassle for a $40 item."},{"reviewerName":"Jody Ricottone","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Gorgeous Electric Kettle","reviewDate":"April 16, 2017","reviewText":"This kettle looks gorgeous. I love how it adds a decorative touch for a utilitarian item. I like that this keeps one burner free when making breakfast in the morning, and means I don't have to use my stove to make tea in the evenings. The spout works well for pouring, we use it primarily for use with our french press.\n\nPros:\n-Boils very carefully\n-Doesn't take up a lot of space\n-Looks lovely on the countertop\n-Has a low boil off measure (I've never forgotten to turn it off, but it says it does this)\n-A very clear on/off toggle that looks like crystal (and has a blue light)\n-The cord can be coiled under the base if you have it very close to an outlet.\n\nCons:\n-No alert for when the kettle has reached boiling (This is my biggest complaint---I have to guess if the water is ready)\n-Won't turn off after an allotted time, will boil until the safety measure for low-water turns it off."},{"reviewerName":"Hinton","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"LOVE THIS ELECTRIC TEA KETTLE MORE THAN I PROBABLY SHOULD!!!","reviewDate":"July 17, 2017","reviewText":"One of the best purchases I ever made! I can't tell you why I love it so much, but I will try. I had seen one at a friend's house and couldn't imagine why you would need one more kitchen appliance that does nothing more than boil water. Makes no sense. But I took advantage of a Prime Day special, and this is my most favorite thing in my kitchen now. It boils water faster than stove top or microwave. I had a thousand boxes and bags of tea that nobody ever drank, and now I drink tea everyday, which was a goal of mine. Why did I not boil water with a kettle or the microwave? I can't tell you, but it just didn't happen. Seemed like way too much trouble. Now, I plug this thing in, and I have tea or instant coffee in an insane amount of time, like less than a minute. I had to make boxed mac-n-cheese and didn't want to wait for the water to boil cuz i was in a hurry, and voila - the electric tea kettle gave me macaroni in a flash. I just poured the boiling water into the pot of raw macaroni and it cooked them! The possibilities that have opened up to me since buying this thing have been life-changing. I'm not kidding. And there is no kettle-whistle noise which used to drive me crazy. It shuts off when it's reaches boiling: you will not burn your house down. And you can go back and pour a refill if needed. I use it now for my French Press and that goes faster as well. It's just easy. And fun. I recommend this thing."},{"reviewerName":"K. Vandenberg","rating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Looks can be deceiving...","reviewDate":"September 30, 2018","reviewText":"After ordering and trying two other kettles that failed for various reasons, available on Amazon, I was happy to find a kettle that was ceramic.\nIt is hard to find a kettle that is not made with substandard materials. I did not want any plastic or aluminum but a material that does not or would not leach harmful metals or toxins. Items made in China seem to be the worse offenders. So, this was the kettle I settled on because it is ceramic and since I ordered it last fall, it has worked well until this past week.\nThe kettle was kept on a coffee cart and used every morning for a single cup of drip coffee and here and there for a cup of herbal tea.\nI was more than disappointed this past week when after it heating a full kettle of water, upon picking it up off the heating base, water everywhere. A horizontal crack appeared about 3” from the bottom of the kettle. This crack is about 4” long. Really disappointing because I have understanding in regard to ceramic/glass and the fact that you do not want to ‘shock’ these types of materials with extreme temperatures. Not wise to pour cold water into a hot pot, which I never did. I am aware of this fact and instead, filled the kettle in the evening with more water after it’s morning use when it was room temperature. So, I never put cool water into the kettle while hot. The kettle is now useless and a big bummer for me because it is too late for a refund. I would NOT recommend this kettle because even with good care, it failed. I will say that visually, it is very nice though."},{"reviewerName":"Midolex","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"It's a really big and heavy kettle!","reviewDate":"January 2, 2018","reviewText":"I should have checked the weight of this kettle. It's too heavy to be practical. I need to use both hands to lift it up from the base when there's water in it. It's really big, too. It took at least 5 min, to boil water, so it is not powerful as it's described. I wish I would I could return it, but I need to pay $6 for return shipping. I regret buying it without thinking about the weight."},{"reviewerName":"Christine","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Cracked handle within one month of use","reviewDate":"July 22, 2016","reviewText":"Within one week of receiving the kettle, we noticed a small crack had formed on the top of the handle. I wanted to love the kettle so I told my husband \"it's probably just a small crack in the ceramic, no big deal.\" Sure enough, within another month of using the kettle, the crack started to get bigger and now it's very obvious that if we're not careful, the whole handle will break off. It's really unfortunate, and I'm no longer able to return it to Amazon. So we've just decided to tape around the crack so that hopefully it will last us a bit longer, but obviously looks terrible. I think that in the end, the product quality doesn't match up to the design, and I'd want to warn those who are buying it to be aware of it.\n\n**Edit** I’ve been using this kettle on and off for about a year and a half. The spout just broke off while I was holding it in my hand, I hadn’t boiled any water yet, I was just about to fill it with some water. and cut my finger. It’s pretty but like most things these days, it’s just not made to last."},{"reviewerName":"AriaCarnevale","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"So far the kettle is great","reviewDate":"December 30, 2018","reviewText":"Aesthetically pleasing, heaver then a metal kettle, but that's expected as it is made out of ceramic. Boils water fast and queit, very easy to use. Also the handle and top, from what i read are made of a different material then ceramic so it will not get hot like the rest of the kettle. The only 2 cons is the top cover is very hard to take off and put back in because of the rubber stopper (which i know is supposed to be as to make sure no water escapes). The 2nd con is like others have mentioned i noticed a smell once i opened up the kettle. I boiled water for the first time to clean it, but the smell was still there, so now i have the hot water from the 2nd boil sitting in the kettle with some baking soda....hopefully that gets rid of the smell, if not I will try the vinegar method. Will update.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nSo...the smell diminished but never went away, but I'm guessing its never going away and it might just be because the kettle is mostly ceramic. I don't taste anything when I brew tea or other hot drinks."},{"reviewerName":"LizzieW","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Exceeds My Expectations, Still Very Happy After One Year","reviewDate":"July 19, 2017","reviewText":"I no longer drink coffee and was using my Kcup machine for hot water for my tea. My machine is getting old and not working very well so I decided I better find a convenient way to heat water quickly and save the machine for kcups only ( others drink coffee). Very pleased with this kettle so far. I wanted a ceramic kettle and although I didn't care for the modern tile design, I decided that this kettle best met my needs for a ceramic kettle. It's much larger than I imagined but I can handle it fine and I don't mind the design ( silver tile) even though it is a bit contemporary for my taste. The thing I really love about this kettle is that it heats so quickly that I don't have to wait but just two minutes ( if that) for a very hot cup of tea. I don't wait for a rapid boil. As soon as I see steam coming out of the neck, I turn it off and the water is PLENTY hot. The handle doesn't get hot and the lid doesn't get hot but the body does of course so one must be careful not to touch it. The lid is secure/won't fall off but I still hold it out of habit when pouring and it helps keep the pot balanced. I like that it has a removable base. The plug is a heavy duty three prong grounded plug and it is recommended that you use a dedicated receptacle which I don't have so what I do is not run anything else from that receptacle while heating. The only other thing I use that receptacle for is my can opener and so, I'm not concerned. It's made in China which disappoints me and I hope it lasts. I normally don't like many small appliances in my kitchen but this kettle is definitely worth the purchase since I don't have to turn on my stove and heat a kettle( and my kitchen) for ten minutes for one cup of tea.\nAfter one year of use the only thing I've noticed is that the heating time does slow down a bit but I also noticed that when I descale it, it seems to heat faster. So maybe the lime scale slows it down? I've not had any cracks or other problems. As far as weight goes, I don't like filling it at the sink because it's a bit hefty so I keep a bottle of filtered water to use for refilling.\nUPDATE Nov. 1, 2018: As of July 2017, I owned this Bella kettle for one year with no problems other than it's heavier than I can handle at this point ( I have a lot of MS weakness symptoms due to Lyme). Yesterday, I noticed that my countertop was covered in water. In the direct sunlight, I was able to see water droplets forming quickly in a ring around the kettle. The kettle had formed a crack right where the wider base meets the more narrow top half. Oh well. I got a lot of use from it. My only warning is that no one who has dexterity problems or muscle weakness should use this."},{"reviewerName":"Max B.","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"It says that it is super quick to heat the water","reviewDate":"September 13, 2016","reviewText":"1. it is bulky - much bulkier that I would have expected from the picture.

This is MUCH slower than ANY other electrical kettle I had (and I had quite a few over the years). The $20 or so Oster (stainless steel) one was the last one before this one that just quit heating one day but it did heat the water much faster.\n\nIt heats the water and it is ceramic.

It is pretty heavy. I need to use 2 hands to hold it after filling/boiling - if I use one hand I'm shaking. I don't mind it though because it is made of ceramic. I tried using a metal one before & it rusted. Then we switched to a plastic one and after a while it started smelling like burnt plastic. I have kids at home; if it was just myself I won't be as concerned but I don't want my kids drinking water that's smelling like burnt plastic. So I decided to spend more on getting ceramic. So far it's been a few months and has been holding up well.\n\nIt's also made with pretty thick walls so I'm not too scared about it hitting the wall or the table. But I do put it down gently & take care of it.\n\nIt's also nice and pretty in my kitchen.

First let me just say that I do have arthritis pretty bad in my left hand, and the weight does not bother me too much. I had posted a question to another reviewer before my purchase about it's weight, and never received a reply. Anyways, The inside does not, I repeat does not have a plastic layer, it is ceramic, just as the outside is. It heats water very fast (you will actually hear the boiling sound), and when the water is ready the button on the bottom will flip off, and the blue light will no longer be on. If you fill the kettle to the max line, you can get one french press with two cups of coffee capacity, and for me one bowl of oatmeal worth of water out of it. The design is really eye catching and I have received quite a lot of compliments on it, as I use it at work to have hot water through the day for tea. I have not smelled any weird smells from the device either. So in all I'd say it is a pretty nice little kettle, and worth the investment."},{"reviewerName":"Shane Wolf","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Beautiful kettle, great design, slightly small.","reviewDate":"January 2, 2018","reviewText":"I love almost everything about this kettle. I had a metal kettle before, so I especially love how it heats up quickly, quietly, and turns itself off without whistling. I also love that I don't have to worry if I turned the stove off after I used it. The inside is mostly ceramic, with only a metal base and heating element. I live in an area that has a lot of hard water, which destroyed the inside of my metal kettle, but this one has been holding up fine. The design is as pictured, and I really love it.\n\nDownsides: It is significantly heavier than my metal kettle (obviously), and the outside does get quite warm after boiling water. Granted, the base and handle stay cool, but since it's so heavy, my instinct is to hold the side. My main complaint is the size. We use it in the mornings for a large french press and two bowls of instant oatmeal, and it barely makes enough for this. This probably just means I need a bigger kettle, but be warned that 1.2L felt like a lot less than I was hoping for.

I'm so happy I gave it a shot. I almost didn't...I mean how difficult is it to fill a standard stove top kettle to boil some water? And I was worried about cluttering my counter. But this baby really is so easy to use, and bonus, there's no annoying whistling or forgetting to turn the stove off. And bottom line...it's MUCH faster. By the time I've got my tea bag ready, the water's done. Plus, it looks awesome on my counter and works with my blue & white decor. It's ceramic, so it's a tad bit heavier than a plastic unit, but I don't care, it's no heavier than a full tea kettle. And pouring from the longer spout is easier to control. It's as functional as it's lovely which makes up for the little bit of heft. I prefer it over plastic any day.

I wanted to write a review after putting it to the test. This ceramic kettle is absolutely incredible. It's stunning, adds a touch of class to my counter, and boils water in less than 3 minutes. Seriously. I've timed it. I use it to heat my baby's water for his bottles & I flip the switch and 25 seconds later I have perfectly warmed water. It's amazing! So much faster and easier than the Dr browns bottle warmer I used for months! I also use this to heat water for tea (about 1 minute or else it's too hot) and to boil water for pasta if I'm in a rush. There's no wrong way to use this kettle and you won't regret buying this item. I got no discount, I paid for this myself. I genuinely LOVE this kettle!

We have had it for over a month now and it works like a charm and heats up super fast- much faster than a tea kettle on the stove. It pours perfectly in your cup too. I especially like the detail to function and design, since we leave ours on the counter all the time (at least for the winter)- a well thought out kitchen appliance with the combination of the retro teapot design and the updated trendy pattern on the front. One thing to be aware of is the weight- because it is ceramic, it is heavy. One way to resolve constantly picking it up - we keep ours right next to the sink and just use our kitchen faucet pull-out to fill it, so we rarely take it off the heating plate except to pour out old water and freshen it occasionally. Definitely a well designed production that works wonderfully."},{"reviewerName":"Leo K","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"I'm glad I went ceramic instead of buying another plastic water kettle","reviewDate":"December 5, 2018","reviewText":"I've had nothing by plastic/\"stainless steel\" water kettles over the years, and for the most part they worked fine for what they did. When the last one was retired after the metal spout rusted within weeks after purchase, I decided that it was time to see what all the fuss was about with ceramic water kettles, and I'm glad I did. We use this daily, multiple times a day, and I have yet to see any rust forming in the few metal parts this has.\n\nWater heats up at about the same rate as other kettles I've used. This kettle is significantly heavily, especially when filled with water, than it's plastic cousins, but no one in the house seems to mind it. For obvious reason, the ceramic get hot, so its a bit tricky pouring out a cup when its full of recently boiled water. Again, +6 months of daily usage and no one's been scolded by hot water, something I couldn't say with the plastic kettle I had before this one.\n\nOnly down side is since this is a solid ceramic pot, and not double walled, water does tend to cool down faster. Not an issue when immediately after boiling, but a 15 minute delay will result in warm, not hot, water.\n\nOh, and it definitely adds a little something to the overall kitchen appearance verses the plastic thing we previously had.\n\nI would have no issues repurchasing or recommending this ceramic water kettle."},{"reviewerName":"Harold","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Easy to use, not to clean.","reviewDate":"October 7, 2019","reviewText":"I purchased this a few years back during my undergraduate years, and it was such a lifesaver for mornings. In fact, it was a perfect product for late-night tea, or in combination with a coffee press for mornings that were crunched for time. I never had an issue with cracks or breaking, as others have mentioned, despite it getting knocked around in plenty of boxes while moving.\n\nHowever, over time, I began to notice that there was seemingly mold appearing in the crevices of the kettle interior (if I remember correctly, this was primarily in the kettle handle, which is hollowed out and allows for water to flow through inside), despite it getting washed fairly regularly. Despite washing thoroughly, scrubbing everywhere that a toothbrush or sponge can reach, and placing it in the dishwasher, nothing can reach these hard-to-reach areas on the interior.

The ceramic is nice and heavy so no fear of easy breaking. Its so pretty and elegant. Its easy pour too, no need to hold the lid, no water splashing. Generally im terrible at serving tea because i have small shaky hands but the water streams out of this with such ease that I don't spill a drop.\n\nIt has an auto shutoff when the water reaches low boil so you dont have to worry about boiling all the water out of it because you forgot it. Simple on and off switch, it lights blue when on and turns back clear as a crystal when its off.\n\nThere are some metal components inside the pot so it is not 100% ceramic but thats not an issue for me. I just make sure its wiped dry inside at the end of the day. The handle doesn't get hot or anything like with some metal kettles. I would recomend this to anyone."},{"reviewerName":"S. E. Regan","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Works well, but gets SUPER HOT","reviewDate":"November 5, 2017","reviewText":"I use this tea pot several times a day. It is attractive and handy. The capacity is 5.5 cups, so if you use the big mugs popular these days, it is good for about two and a half cups, so I have had friends complain that it doesn't make enough for when they have company. But for my purposes it is a perfect size. The only problem with it is that it gets SUPER HOT. So, unless I add a coupel of ice cubes it can take 20-30 minutes until my tea can safely be consumed, even after a 10-15 minute brewing time."},{"reviewerName":"Stephen A.

Love the Ceramic! I grew up with electric kettles, so I knew how convenient they were. However my parents always had plastic ones, and I didn't want to boil my water in plastic, so I never got one for myself. My daughter has fallen in love with tea, but would sometimes forget to turn off the pot of water on the stove at the right time, and I was afraid she would boil one dry. I started looking for glass ones, but didn't want something fragile. This ceramic one is Perfect! There is a silicone seal on the lid, but it doesn't come in contact with the water. At 1.5 L, it holds enough for several large cups. Since it is ceramic, it stays warm a long time. It won't turn on if water level is below \"min\" so there is no risk of boiling it dry. We have moderately hard water, but no build up so far after daily use for two months. I am buying one now for my dad, who has very hard water, so I will update after he uses it for a while. The only negative is that a full Kettle is quite heavy. I only notice when making coffee with you pour-over cone (I'm not terribly graceful making a circular pour with this big kettle) . So it may be difficult for someone who is frail or has problems gripping heavy items."},{"reviewerName":"CityGirl","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Love!","reviewDate":"November 22, 2016","reviewText":"My wife bought this kettle for her French press.

There are only a couple of cons I've noticed so far. 1. The cord in the pictures makes it look retractable but it's just a really bulky cord that's wrapped around the inside of the base, so you basically have to unwrap the whole thing to plug it in anywhere. It's completely fine if I had known, I just thought I was getting a retractable cord that would take up less space. 2. It does take longer to heat up water than most newer/uglier kettles on the market. I knew going in it wouldn't be a fast one and I chose the look of it instead of the faster function, but just in case someone reading this wants a faster heating kettle I wanted to mention it. 3. The very light plastic base doesn't seem very sturdy or like it will last nearly as long as the hefty ceramic kettle.\n\nThe reason I bought it though, is because every other kettle out right now is ugly stainless steel or glass and this fits my decor so much better. It really is beautiful and the ceramic kettle part is very well made and seems like it will hold up for a very long time. It does heat the water well(just not fast) and it holds a decent amount. The lid stays on very well and has never gotten too hot for me to touch or hold while pouring tea. It is a little heavy but nothing I can't hold while filled with water. It's served it purpose perfectly so far, to heat up water in a beautiful kettle that I can keep on my counters. Seriously, it's gorgeous!\n\nAlso, shipping was great with my Prime subscription. It came within 2 days and delivered on a Sunday.

I loved how it looked, but it fell apart in a short time (especially considering the price.) I really shopped around for a new kettle--I didn't want it to do too many things, I didn't want it to beep incessantly, and I wanted it to feel good. I looked online and went to retail stores to feel the kettles I was considering. I finally settled on this Bella kettle because it's completely ceramic and super simple. I love it. The tea pot style spout makes it pour more nicely, and with so few moving parts, nothing can break. It's super quiet which I like and its vintage look fits my kitchen. After so much agonizing, I'm so pleased with this kettle and it's half the price of the Smeg and feels better made. No plastic. I was also worried I wouldn't like removing the lid completely to fill it (as opposed to popping the lid with a switch which most metal kettles have) but it's actually easy and I like the snug fit.

Another thing I had not considered (for some reason) is that this kettle is quite heavy. I've only ever had the stainless steel before and was surprised at the weight of the empty ceramic kettle.

I was initially considering similar plastic kettles in the $90-120 range but stumbled across the BELLA and I'm thrilled. It's beautiful on my countertop and it pours so neatly. The ceramic makes it feel more substantial and like a proper tea kettle. It doesn't look like an appliance. It was also half the cost of anything else I was considering. It is heavier than a plastic kettle but it isn't too heavy. Even when full I have no problem lifting it and pouring but for someone with poor upper body strength it might prove to be a little unwieldy. There's no indicator for how full this is but I always have the habit of dumping the water and refilling each time anyway.

It's absolutely beautiful and one of those few kitchen appliances that you WANT to leave out on the counter even when it's not being used. It heats up the water right at 5 minutes. As other reviewers noted, it doesn't have any kind of sound to alert you when it's ready, other than the click the switch makes when it turns off. I actually prefer this - I hate the sound of buzzers/alarms. We're usually in the kitchen still getting everything ready for that 1st first cup anyway so we can hear the click when it goes off. Some other reviewers also mentioned that it's rather heavy, but again I like the weight of it as it doesn't feel like it's some kind of cheap kettle that's going to break into a million pieces the first time you bump it into the sink.

As long as you don't have tendonitis or carpel tunnel,etc then the weight of a full kettle shouldn't be that bothersome. I usually have one hand on the bottom of the kettle (to distribute the weight) since the base of it doesn't get hot (the bottom inch contains the heating element, etc). The hottest part to me would be the spout and the middle area.\nIt holds enough water for 4 mugs of tea.\nI haven't had any need to clean it really since I'm only boiling water in it (I don't put the tea inside) and I use filtered water, not tap.\nI find the lid to be very tight fitting on my kettle, which is great, but I choose to rest the lid on top instead. The silicone rim makes it stay on even when pouring (if the water level is at the minimum or higher) and no steam escapes so I don't bother pushing it onto the kettle all the way. I don't see the need when I'm not serving guests.\nI would recommend this for anyone trying to avoid plastic kettles.\nFor Canadians, I would also suggest buying it off Walmart instead since they carry them for about 50 bucks.

But too late to return it and I just recently bumped the spout into the kitchen wall (clearly, my fault and not the manufacturer's) so now I have a chipped kettle glued precariously together with a breaking handle and a chipped lid.

I tend to unplug appliances when not in use. My first Bella's 3 prong plug lost it's grounding prong after about two years. I felt I got good use out of it and bought it again."},{"reviewerName":"Kenneth W.","rating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"It was beautiful, but now it's leaking and there aren't any chips or cracks.","reviewDate":"May 29, 2019","reviewText":"I loved this teapot until I didn't. I got it in February and it's currently end of May. It was fine and had no issues at all. Seemed very sturdy and I loved it! However, we just moved (and before anyone says that it must have gotten damaged, it didn't. I personally held this and it didn't get boxed up because I didn't want to risk it) and I just started to try and boil a pot of water and low and behold it's leaking SO BAD. It won't hold the water long enough for me to put it on the heating disk. There aren't any cracks or anything, it's leaking from the very bottom. So disappointed because it's so beautiful and was going to look stunning in our new kitchen. But now I can't use it and I prefer my decor to have purpose so I have no need for this now."},{"reviewerName":"Jojo","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Looks great, but wish it had better functionality.","reviewDate":"February 1, 2018","reviewText":"This a very aesthetically-pleasing kettle, however, I'd prefer better functionality and won't repurchase. It's very heavy, and it gets very hot on the outside after coming to a boil. This is to be expected but it makes it difficult when trying to take off the lid and refill if you need to. The lid stays stuck on very well and sometimes is hard to pull off, especially if the kettle is hot. I also frequently wished I had a kettle that could show how full it is from the outside, rather than having to take off the lid and look inside.\n\nI had this tea pot for two years and it just quit working today. Two years is probably a good timeline for a tea kettle that got as much use as mine did (we're a family of coffee and tea drinkers and use it frequently). I'll be buying a new kettle that is lighter and more functional. But I can't deny this is a beautiful tea kettle!"},{"reviewerName":"freeindeed","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Pretty but not as practical","reviewDate":"January 8, 2017","reviewText":"This is a beautiful kettle but heavier than the stainless steel electric kettle I used to have. Also, my old kettle had a short, wide spout so you could fill the kettle through the spout if you wanted, or it had a flip-top lid. This Bella kettle the only option for filling is to completely remove the (breakable) lid. If you have kids/teens using the kettle a lot this may not be the best choice.

I had to mail in a receipt, a sticker from the bottom of the heating base, and cut off 2 inches of the cord (there was nothing wrong with the base until I did this), and mail it all to Canada, which cost over $10 in postage.

Loved it!!! Grandchildren could use it safely, we used it for everything! The spout got broken when someone hit it on something, we were so sad. I looked all over for a replacement and finally googled. we didn't remember the name Bella. Ordered this one, it came right away and everyone is happy again. It heats the water really fast, the bottom stays cool, so I can take it to the table without worrying about where to sit it. Grandchildren make oatmeal, I make tea, everyone makes their own things. As I've seen mentioned, this is ceramic, so there's no \"plasticy\" or metal smell. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I don't know why different designs are different prices. Also, it is a little bit heavy when full, but we do solve that by putting the loop handle on the lid perpendicular to the spout so we can put a finger there while pouring to keep it from being so heavy on the pouring wrist!\nBottom line --- this will always be an absolute necessity in our house!!! Everyone should have this bella!!"},{"reviewerName":"panamaus","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Please calm down... The smell goes away.","reviewDate":"April 23, 2015","reviewText":"A lot of the one-star reviews I read for this product complain (in some cases vehemently) about the bad smell emanating from the silicon ring that seals the lid to the base of the kettle. This was very off-putting to me, as I am particularly sensitive to smell and my wife and I were looking in particular for an electric kettle that did not have plastic parts. After weighing the bulk of the positive reviews against this complaint, I decided to purchase the kettle and see for myself.\n\nWhen it came out of the box, there was an easily detectible odor to the silicon seal. It was a very pungent chemical smell, but not so powerful that you could detect it from across the room or anything. You basically had to be standing over the thing to smell it. If you held the lid up to your face, it was quite strong, but we boiled a few pots of water to get the product primed and decided to see if it affected the taste of the water or the beverages we made from it. For the most part it did not.\n\nHere's the thing that the one star reviews don't tell you because the reviewers didn't bother to find it out: The smell goes away. It is basically off-gassing from the brand-new food-grade silicon gasket. Like that \"new car smell\", once the off-gassing completes, the smell gradually dissipates and before you know it, it's completely gone. We've had our kettle for almost four months now, and I absolutely cannot detect even the slightest hint of that smell from the gasket anymore, even when I hold it right up to my nose and inhale deeply. It's gone.\n\nThis is a great kettle and by far the best plastic-free one you are likely to find anywhere. We love ours and use it constantly. If you are not so sensitive and can allow for a 45-day off-gassing period to wait out the gasket odor, I would not hesitate to buy this product and I recommend it enthusiastically."},{"reviewerName":"Diana","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Love this !","reviewDate":"July 18, 2019","reviewText":"This kettle is beautiful and so easy to use.

I wish Amazon offered a replacement or refund for selling an unreliable product."},{"reviewerName":"Senai","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Didn't survive long","reviewDate":"September 16, 2019","reviewText":"I purchased this tea pot 03/27/2019 and as of today (09/16/2019) the tea pot will not come on.\nI use sparingly (made 10-15 times total). 6 months of gentle use for it to go out?

I bought this because I was throwing a tea party themed baby shower and wanted to have hot water always available for the variety of teas that were served. It worked so well!!! I use it at home almost every day and love it so much, I even bought one for my mom-who also uses it almost every day.

It takes as long to boil as an open pot on my old electric stove, so other than it being easier to pour from, I am seeing no real benefits from this $40 appliance. I am thinking I will try to return and get a higher wattage one next.\nThe only reason I bought this one was bc an old roommate had a kettle that looked like it, but was actually very fast, and I mistakenly believed it to be the same one."},{"reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Love it","reviewDate":"July 18, 2017","reviewText":"Just recently broke my old kettle and found this new one. Great for a present. Love the quality and the print. Sort of a little heavy when kettle is completely full. This kettle is different tho because it is ceramic, doesn't give a metal taste to your water and works fast. Easy to clean and the handle doesn't get hot, the lid has a silicone ring so it stays in place. Highly recommend this kettle."},{"reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Very versatile product!","reviewDate":"March 30, 2019","reviewText":"This item is beautiful just as it looks.

I've been using it for about a month. The only reason I gave it 3 stars for ease of use is because it's a bit heavy. So I would not recommend it for someone who would have issues lifting a full kettle with one hand.

It's gorgeous and well-made. Other reviewers commented on a plastic smell, but I haven't noticed anything unusual in the smell or taste of the water.

I purchased the 1.2L size which is bigger than I thought it would be, but that’s not a bad thing. I love the elegant look. It makes me feel classy when pouring a cup of tea. I also love how the pot comes off of the base freely so I am not restricted by a cord. Overall, I recommend it."},{"reviewerName":"Kirsten","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great electric kettle","reviewDate":"April 18, 2019","reviewText":"This is a great electric kettle. It heats up water in no time and we like the design/look of it.

A lot larger than I expected (but to me that's a plus). Simple with 1 button to press that lights up, which automatically turns off once water reaches temp. Heats up quick, not too noisy. LOVE the feature that lets you easily take it off its base and pour...very convenient and many electric kettles do not have this feature. Only downside with a ceramic kettle is that you have to be very careful when putting on and taking off the lid so as not to break. So far... great purchase!"},{"reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Absolutely love!","reviewDate":"November 3, 2019","reviewText":"This is my second Bella ceramic tea kettle, and I love them!

We have found other uses for quick hot water too: heating up baby bottles, steaming vegetables, french press coffee, speeding up the pasta cooking process.

I have a small kitchen with brown cabinets and dark appliances so did not look as elegant in my kitchen as it might in others. So keep that in mind. But if you need hot water this is NOT the kettle to purchase. It is AWFUL. I have used this 5 times so far and the water does NOT get hot enough. It is horrible. Worst purchase I ever made.

The design is adorable, not in a cutesy childish way, rather classically adorable. I was worried it would look too bohemian but the blue and white has a classic look which is perfect for my old fashioned taste.\n\nThe pot works exactly as marketed. It has a switch on the back that you flip and wait for the water to boil. Once it boils, it very handily shuts itself off, giving you the peace of mind knowing its safe (won't boil away) and that it will not be powered on 24/7. It heats water fantastically fast. I pour the water in, flip the switch, find my favorite mug and then try to make a decision of which of my teas to pick from (I may or may not have a million of them). By the time I have chosen my tea, the pot is already done and I can the enjoy the infinite bliss only a fresh cup of tea can provide!\n\nI took the pot to the office to share because our water service is gone. My coworkers love the pot so much that they now periodically bring me a gallon of water to contribute so that they can have hot tea/coffee/hot chocolate. That being said, I do recommend using filtered water - where we live the water is naturally \"hard\" meaning lots of minerals. Those minerals can build up in the pot and cause flaking and debris in the water on subsequent boils.\n\nAllow me to explain why I purchased this pot over any of the others available on Amazon. I spent days researching this, reading product reviews, going to forums and more. I am a little paranoid about heating anything up in plastic due to chemicals leaching into the water. with the Bella I have no such fears! She is made of glass and stainless steel at every portion that will come into contact with water. The Bottom has a stainless steel plate for heat, and a rod of stainless steel that goes up the inside side of the pitcher. because it Is glass and stainless it does have some weight to it. but definitely weighs less than my pressure cooker! it sits on a small base with a center thing that conducts heat into the pot. the disk doesn't get hot on the edges. and the area that surrounds it doesn't get hot allowing for ease of movement and no burns! (for this klutz a major concern).\n\nI am officially a huge fan and will definitely be buying this in future not only for myself but for anyone that could possibly need it!\n\nThis teapot has truly changed my life and I don't know how I ever lived without it. I dream of a time where I can Have two of these bad girls (her name is Bella, I Decided she's a girl don't judge) so that I can have one for home. Its a wonderful gadget and absolutely perfect for its function."},{"reviewerName":"victoria","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great","reviewDate":"August 14, 2019","reviewText":"Great!

Prior to this purchase, we had a glass electric tea kettle; I was always concerned with the fragility. After my husband broke our glass kettle while washing it, the search began for something a little more sturdy and more importantly, not plastic. First of all this teapot is so pretty, I don't mind leaving it out on my counter. Additionally it is much, much quieter than our prior kettle.\nAs others mentioned it is a little heavy (I was fully aware of this prior to purchase) especially when full, but it feels more durable than our previous tea pot. The cord is way too short (another fact I was aware of prior) but that is remedied easily with a 1ft extension cord. Finally, there's no screen in the spout to prevent hard water deposits from pouring into your tea; not a deal breaker but it's one feature I do miss from my other tea kettle. Overall, I'm extremely satisfied with this purchase."},{"reviewerName":"Jarek Sliwinski","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Elegant","reviewDate":"February 25, 2019","reviewText":"All OK but it could be bigger.... other than that very good"},{"reviewerName":"Renae","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Five Stars","reviewDate":"October 8, 2017","reviewText":"So beautiful and works great!"},{"reviewerName":"Juliet Persaud","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"I love It's make my life easy","reviewDate":"January 25, 2019","reviewText":"It is so easy to clean You have the hat water very fast"},{"reviewerName":"Amy","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Broken handle","reviewDate":"October 19, 2018","reviewText":"I love this kettle, but after 3 months the handle seems to have cracked at the top.

I was so excited to get it and it looked great in my office. I've only had it less than 3 weeks and started using it less than a week ago. After 3-4 uses, the on/off switch does NOT work. It's a simple switch that you push down to turn on. It will not stay down. I see that a few others have had the same issue. When I was first hand washing the kettle I noticed that the sound of a small metal ball bearing or something was rolling around within the inner base of the kettle (not the hot plate it sits on). Since it worked and was so cute, I ignored this fact and it didn't \"roll around\" every time I picked it up so I didn't worry about it. Now I wonder if it's related. I may buy another and hope it's not a lemon as well. Right now I'm looking for another brand but it's hard to find a good looking ceramic electric kettle that is this size and has mostly good reviews.

But, I had this gift certificate, and thought I would get a new one, and this was my choice.\n\nIt holds enough water to make a few cups of tea, so no complaint there, although the minimum and maximum levels look a little constraining, as the element is inside the kettle, and not in the base like my other kettle which would hold an extra cup or more of water. This unit is quite heavy when full, being ceramic, and the handle is quite a distance way from the body of the kettle, making it feel not only a little awkward to hold, but makes it feel heavier as the filled kettle is further away from your hand. See picture, you can see how far away the kettle it, although this is good in the fact you keep your hand far enough away from the hot kettle, but I think it is a little too far. I deducted a star because of this.\n\nBut as far as heating the water, it is great. Heats in a little quicker time than my stainless steel model, which may be because the element is inside the pot (?), but again, I haven't measured the time, it is a perceived time savings. It looks and feels like a sturdy unit, but being a ceramic kettle, I have fears of one day it breaking and spilling hot water everywhere, but that might be unfounded, as if feels solid. If you have weak wrists, this may not be for you, but my wife (she's 71 now) doesn't seem to have problems, and likes the kettle. And she makes tea with it more than I do. I'm just giving some honest views for anyone wanting to buy it.\n\nIn short, I do like it, but the weight is an issue, and the slightly less capacity of water due to the internal heating element, but since it is the two of us, we only make 2 cups at a time, so the water capacity is adequate for our needs. If we nave company, at least now we have an additional unit."},{"reviewerName":"Brian","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Look no further","reviewDate":"January 25, 2019","reviewText":"I like the style.

I followed the instruction for first time use written in the manual. But the smell of plastic or some chemical was present even after several days of use. It really made the tea taste bad. Also the lid was very difficult to open and I was afraid I would break the handle off from trying to take it off the kettle. After reading some reviews here, I took off the silicone gasket/ring around the lid and also took the plug off the lid. According to the manual, the gasket/ring around the lid regulates the temperature and without it, it may not shut off automatically. So I was a bit worried about this. But the taste of plastic/chemical was just too much that I decided to chance it. Now the water tastes fine and the kettle shuts off automatically. Without the silicone ring on the lid, it is not super tight fitting so when pouring water, be sure not to tip over too far. So I'm very happy with this kettle. It is heavier than typical plastic and stainless ones but I personally like the weight on this kettle."},{"reviewerName":"Debra","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"One Star","reviewDate":"February 8, 2018","reviewText":"Stopped working in the 1st month - I returned it."},{"reviewerName":"Jessica Marie","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"It looks amazing on my coffee bar and everyone loves it","reviewDate":"February 9, 2017","reviewText":"This is the cutest tea kettle ever!

My naturopath says not to heat things in plastic, and that includes water. I've been using a plastic version on my wet bar and now that's gone.\n\nNot that it matters, but the black in the floral pattern is complementary to the other appliances on the bar.\n\nLikes:\n+ Silicone seal around the lid. Yay - no plastic.\n+ Swivel base. Unlike my previous model which had to go on its base only one way, this kettle fits on the base from any direction.\n+ Unit turns off when water reaches a boil (previous unit did this, too), and it also turns off if the unit is dry.\n+ Heating element is stainless steel.\n\nDislikes:\n- No sight glass. I can't tell how much water is in the kettle unless I open the lid.\n\nThat's a bummer for me, but really, it's my only complaint. Everything else about this kettle is really nice. Hi quality, attractive, and it does exactly what it's designed to do."},{"reviewerName":"Gina Burgess","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Love the Keep Warm button","reviewDate":"February 16, 2019","reviewText":"This kettle is marvelous. The lid comes completely off, and it has a rubber seal that keeps it tight so it doesn't fall off when pouring. There are several heat levels and the boiling level takes about 4 minutes to boil 1.7 liters of water. That is faster than my microwave.\n\nThe instructions aren't that clear, but you have to push the on button, then push the heat level you desire, then either while the water is heating or even after it is hot, you push the keep warm button and it stays hot for 2 hours! AND what I really like is that you can remove the kettle, pour your water, and put it back on the element and you haven't lost your program. It still keeps your water warm at the temperature you first selected!\n\nThe color is beautiful, but it isn't white and blue. It is more like a soft cream white--whiter than cream color, but not much.\n\nLooks great on my countertop. Fits perfectly under the cabinet and can remove/replace the kettle easily.\n\nThe only thing that is not quite loveable is that the instructions say to put the element on a trivet or put something between it and the vinyl countertop or it might discolor/darken it. So I have it sitting on the two trivets my granddaughter made me. Was wondering how to use them :D"},{"reviewerName":"Suzanne in GA","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"A BPA-Free Electric Kettle to Admire!","reviewDate":"December 6, 2018","reviewText":"Making water hot is not terribly exciting - nor does it matter much if it takes a few seconds longer. Nevertheless - this kettle is a real beauty (and yes, it makes water boil quicker than the one it had replaced in my kitchen), and there are two things it does to justify paying a little extra.\n\nFirst - it claims (and appears) to be BPA-free. BPA is common in plastic products and could dissolve into water. There is a recent growing awareness regarding BPA as a health concern, so having a new BPA-free electric kettle is a good way to eliminate another potential source of it. Second - It is such a beauty! The near-transparent glass-type material lets one see the water boiling, which is a sight enhanced by the LED lights and color.\n\nThis is not a purely functional tea kettle in terms and look (as represented in its pricing) - but rest assured it also functions very well! I also like the automatic shut-off feature and the swivel base the kettle rests on. This product is a little more expensive than other brands, but I think it is worth the price. Five stars!"},{"reviewerName":"A. Brink","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Looks nice, boils fast and offers you temp choices and warming option.

The first thing I notice is it’s much better looking than my other ones but the second thing I notice is it’s way heavier than my metal ones that I have had before it. But I like the look so much that I think it’s worth it. I’ve only been using it a couple days and I really like it so far. It’s definitely fast and if you haven’t tried an electric kettle you dont know what your missing. Fast and easy to use and safe because you dont have to worry about leaving it on, it will shut off automatically. This feature is great for anyone especially seniors who forget things like that. But if you get one for a senior I would recommend a lighter one than this. One other thing that’s different from other ones is that you cannot see the water level from the outside."},{"reviewerName":"Quixote010","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Atttractive and functional...","reviewDate":"February 25, 2019","reviewText":"My wife is super particular about what sits on her counter. Fortunately, this one gets to stay.\nHeavy and modern, this ceramic water heater heats quite quickly and easier than in a microwave. The sensors on the control panel allow you to select a particular type of tea (black, oolong, etc.) and the water heats to the recommended temperature. If you want just boiling water and to keep it at that temperature, one touch will do that.\n\nThe pot is well made and the top fits securely to avoid an accidental spilling. I’ve never really appreciated the need for a pot like this, it it has now become a great boon in the kitchen. It would make for a great gift since it fits with any decor, doesn’t take up space, and functions as advertised."},{"reviewerName":"Christine K.

Took me 3 weeks to pick one out, my last kettle I purchased at a thrift store sans whistle and the insides were being torn apart due to forgetting it on the stove so it was deffinitely time for a new machine. We have a lovely little electric kettle at work that we use fairly often throughout the day and I loved the speed and ease of it so I knew electric was the way I was wanting to go. After looking through many many models on many different sites and in stores I came back and decided to take the plunge on this one.\n\nI purchased it in \"Like New\" condition, there were a couple of seeming water spots on the inside but not another hair was out of place. After having it now for give or take a week or two I am a complete fan!\n\nIt can be heavy for those with \"softer\" wrists, especially when it actually has water in it, but for a regular person it's nothing. I want to say it weighs 3 pounds empty. It's very quiet as well! Of course, when it reaches it's boiling point there is some sound but nothing overwhelming and it falls to an immediate decline.\n\nThere is no whistle, no timer, no fancy buttons - just one on/off switch (that has automatic shut off) that lights up blue when in use. It has a safe boil heating element so you don't have to worry about dribbles.\n\nNow, because it is ceramic it definitely does get hot, but the handle is just the right size and shape to keep you safe from coming in contact with the body - the neck can be warm but manageable, thankfully the bottom (which is plastic seeming) stays completely cool even after several back-to-back uses and you should feel safe touching the bottom to use as leverage - or at least this was so in my case.\n\nThe lid is on there tight and good, but be gentle when removing it. I'm noticing I'm trying to yank it off then having to stop myself before the big yank in fear of not watching my hands and breaking the little ceramic lid on the counter/table/dog whatever may hit it - I'm trying to learn to twist it off gently now and that seems to be much more productive then yanking without a care.\n\nAll in all I would highly recommend and will be coming back to buy a few more as gifts for friends and family! Maybe even at full price next time lol"},{"reviewerName":"Eugenia","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Electric tea kettle","reviewDate":"July 19, 2019","reviewText":"This is my first electric tea kettle ever. I typically use the ones that warm up water on a stove, but then again, if you are drinking tea. all water needs to be used up while it is still hot. And even with insulated pots, the water does not stay warm over the prolonged period of time. With electric pot, it is easy to keep water warmed up over prolonged period of time.\n\nThis pot also looks nice, so when on the counter, it looks presentable. Base is detachable and one can use tea kettle by itself so in that sense, it is multi purpose. I was particularly attracted to this pot because it measures the amount of water in liters (metric system)."},{"reviewerName":"TWL50","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Boils water quickly, looks sharp","reviewDate":"December 27, 2018","reviewText":"One of the reasons I chose this was the design.

It survived heavy use throughout college, has been banged on cement walls and dropped, and yet it still works perfectly! I love it so much that I took it across the country with me when I moved!\nThe only warnings I'll give is that if you consistently fill it up past the max line (which is clearly marked on the inside), it might start to spill at the bottom because water has built up there. I realized that after I'd been overfilling it for months, stopped overfilling it, and the problem stopped.\nAfter heavy use for five years, it had developed hard water stains on the bottom, but I poured in some vinegar and let it sit for a day and the stains disappeared.\nI highly recommend this kettle!"},{"reviewerName":"Jnaismith","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Rubbish can't use it the wiring is not for uk ...","reviewDate":"October 8, 2014","reviewText":"Rubbish can't use it the wiring is not for uk can't send it back it will cost more than it cost in the first place my advice is\nDon't buy from USA"},{"reviewerName":"M.

With all of the fantastic reviews and little report of what happened to us initially, I am going with the notion that we just got a one off. The first unit that was sent to us would not work in our kitchen with the GFCI circuit system. It would pop our reset button every time. After trying other appliances with heating elements I determined that it was the unit at fault. Amazon shipped our replacement immediately and it was here the next day. The new kettle is fantastic and boils water at an outstandingly fast pace. It looks great on the counter and comes recommended by our friends across the pond. I totally recommend you go ahead with this purchase, and disregard the possibility of having one wired incorrectly. Of course this would be five stars, and is as far as the new unit is concerned, but as an honest reviewer I must subtract for our initial issues."},{"reviewerName":"Lasha","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Beautiful, practical - great gift for tea lovers","reviewDate":"November 21, 2018","reviewText":"We LOVE the Bella ceramic electric tea kettle. The black and white design is very eye catching and blends in any kitchen. Putting it together was simple. The kettle goes on the base, put on the lid and you are ready after plugging it in! You must fill up the kettle over the minimum line but not above the maximum line. It's takes about a minute to heat and the off switch turns off automatically, so no worrying you left it on.

It’s working great. I haven’t had any puddles or cracks. It is heavy, but I just fill it with a filtered water pitcher so I’m not moving I around often. No issues with the rubber sealing thing at the top. It also boils way faster than any of the many electronic and old school kettles I’ve had.

It broke the spout AND took a whole lot of paint off the cooktop. Well, I ordered a whole new Bella kettle immediately (though I kept the undamaged old base and lid just in case). When my husband came home and I told him what happened to the kettle, he said, \"But that was absolutely the perfect kettle for us.\" It was. It matched our beautiful kitchen white and Mexican tile walls; it was good and heavy and expensive looking, it heats faster than anything else, it stays pristinely clean (no \"fur\" as the English call the residue that builds inside a kettle used only for water boiling), and it is big, like a coffee pot.

I am not the only customer to experience this, I realized after reading the lower rated reviews. I have contacted customer service regarding the 2 year warranty but have not heard back in two weeks so take that as you will.\n\nThe kettle is very cute on the counter. It's not that quiet when heating up water (and seemed to get louder the longer I owned it). The sides get very hot as it's 100% ceramic and there is no insulation. It's also very heavy when full of water and after about a year the switch to turn it on and off started acting up. Overall, I really enjoyed this product (if not the product support) and would recommend it to someone who requires a water kettle for light use.

After reading countless reviews for countless electric kettles I took the plunge and waged my bets on this kettle being the best fit for us. We have a coffee bar off the kitchen and previously exclusively used a Keurig. I was dying to switch to a better brew but knew that if we went the \"pour over\" route that I would have to get an electric kettle or our coffee bar would be rendered useless. This particular kettle really appealed to me because I knew it would be out for everyone to see, all the time. The negative reviews really held me back from purchasing at first but ultimately I'm really glad we took the chance. Heed the warnings - this is heavy! I knew this upon ordering and knew that some had experienced the ceramic cracking near the handle (perhaps due to fatigue) so I'm mindful of my pour. I always use a towel and support the spout with my left hand while pouring - this helps combat the weight issue while also controlling my pour. It consistently takes 7 minutes to heat a \"max fill\" pot. The lid is secure and easy to remove. I wouldn't change a thing about it - even knowing it's heavy, which makes me feel like it is likely a little more strong and will resist a crack when accidentally knocked against the sink wall. I would definitely recommend this kettle to anyone who does not have trouble lifting something a little heavy with one hand."},{"reviewerName":"A","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Works great, looks great","reviewDate":"February 1, 2018","reviewText":"This has become one of my most used appliances! It brings water to a boil in half the time it takes in the microwave, let alone the stove. Not only does this save time when making tea (which I use it for multiple times a day,) but I also use it to bring water to a boil to save time when cooking things such as pasta or steamed vegetables. (Pour the boiling water into the preheated cooking pot/pan, don't attempt to cook in this kettle!)\n\nI also sometimes take it out of the kitchen so I can have a second/third/seventh cup of tea while working in my home office or watching tv.\n\nThis kettle is pretty- it looks good on your counter, and nice enough to use for serving guests in a more formal setting. I got the silver tile color, and the silver design is actually metallic, not a flat grey. I hosted a tea party themed shower with pots of loose leaf tea. I was able to quickly and conveniently heat water to fill and refill the teapots because of this kettle, and got many compliments on it.\n\nThe kettle is incredibly easy to use and maintain. I follow the manual's cleaning and care instructions, and mine is still working and looking like new, despite heavy use and hard water. I love the safety automatic off switch.\n\nAnother feature I love is that the cord can be wound up and stored under the base."},{"reviewerName":"Amin","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great machine, But it broke after 2 months","reviewDate":"June 21, 2019","reviewText":"Everything is good about this product, except that it stopped working after two months. I get that it could be a defect, however two months for a defect to show up is weird.\nI like the temperature control, and I also like how easy it is to use. My complaints are:\n1. The lid on top is design very poorly compared to the previous models I owned, it doesn’t open up easily and it’s dangerous when it’s hot as the ceramic gets hot and your hand also gets exposed to steam.\n2. The pot is super heavy, I get that it’s ceramic, But surely there should be a way to reduce the weight.\nAn Amazon complaint:\n\nIf customer service is key, then Amazon should replace the item on the spot especially when They have a support line for this product, and send the defective item back to manufacturer themselves, rather than the customer reaching out to the manufacturer and wasting more time and not having the product to use."},{"reviewerName":"Maddie","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"5 PROS & 1.5 CONS","reviewDate":"March 4, 2019","reviewText":"PROS:\n-It's stylish. I have not had a visitor who hasn't commented on how great it looks.\n-It boils, quick.\n-It's reaaaaaally easy to clean. I use filtered water to start to minimize the build up, but one boil with a water-vinegar solution makes it look like new anyway. I am never worried about rust or dirt because I treat it nice to begin with.\n-The first one I had lasted for years and looked just as fresh and pretty as it did out of the box.\n-Most of it is ceramic, so it minimizes the amount of plastic in your kitchen, if that's your thing (because it's mine).\n\nCON\n-My first one bit the dust after 5 years of heavy use (boiling MULTIPLE times a day). I just wished it lasted longer. I could have had a part replaced, but it ended up being cheaper and easier to reorder a new one from Amazon.\n-It's heavier than a metal teapot, but honestly, I DON'T CARE. If you have feeble, old wrists, then maybe look at not using a ceramic pot that if you drop, it could break. But that's a choice you make when you buy something CERAMIC.\n-Nothing else.

I always envied hers so when we relocated to a new home I saw my opportunity to have a nice cute kettle for the new house. It arrived on time, unbroken, brand new. No chips or scratches. I was a little worried that I may open a box to broken pieces. Or that after a few times of using it I would find a crack in the handle or lid. So far it is still in one piece and works just as a kettle should, only it looks cuter than a regular kettle. I have only had it for a week and we have made tea a more than a few times so I am pretty happy with it. One thing would be a suggestion to the sellers/manufacturers- make more designs! There are just way too few designs and I went with the blue one as it was the closest to my decor theme.

I like how the cord wraps around the bottom so you don’t have to have the cord hanging out all over the counter if you don’t need it. The turn off feature is nice as well. I wish that it was a little bigger. I feel like it doesn’t hold that much water to the fill line, although it claims to heat 1.2 L. Like other reviewers have said once it heats up you can’t get the top off until it cools down. This isn’t an extremely big deal for me. Also a thought to add its ceramic so you can’t add cold water to a hot pitcher or you may experience cracking. The other issue that others may have is that this pot is really heavy. It’s ceramic so I expected it to weigh more than my steel pot but it’s heavier then I anticipated.

My favorite thing about this kettle is that it is ceramic! I have had this kettle for over a month. It boils quickly and I absolutely love the shut off feature when it has reached a full boil- no worries that it will continue boiling and boil dry. The handle is overly large for my liking when handling the kettle to pour but it does help keep your hand away from the heat. It is a bit heavy when filled with water, so I wouldn't recommend it for an older person as it can be cumbersome to hold and pour with the weight.

When I turned it on, I kept noticing droplets of water on the outside of the kettle, almost like it was weeping. Apparently at some point a crack formed around the entire circumference of the bottom of the kettle, causing water to leak out.\n\nUnfortunately this makes it completely useless, and it's not exactly a cheap kettle.

I think a lot of tea kettles hold way more. but I am a single person so it's no biggie and works fine for me.\nA tip - some people say it takes time to get the plastic-y toxic smell out of it - but just wash it with some dish soap (making sure not to get it on the bottom, obviously) and water and it goes away immediately.

I love it. I was going to go with a more tech fancy one but realized the cuteness of my coffee cups drive me. This heats up to a boil within 6-7 min (sooner if you don’t fill all the way up). Notice I said BOIL, so you can’t drink immediately. I let it steep my teabag until it’s ready. My favorite thing is the appearance. Absolutely adorable and looks so cute in my kitchen. It’s a thick ceramic so I’m very careful when filling up in sink. I wish it stayed on at a drinkable level for an hour or so after it boils so I could get multiple cups without turning back on. Love the 360 degree base. Another critic is the cord and base. Not weighted so cord can actually flip it over if you store your cord under (no retraction, just wraps under...which I don’t do).

I throw away the silicon around the lid the second I opened the package. Just put your hand on the lid when pouring, and there's no need for a sealed silicon ring ever. However, there's another silicon seal on the bottom inside the kettle that cannot be removed. After making 10 cups, I no longer could taste any plastic though. There's also a white plastic piece on top of the vertical overflow pipe, and I lost it when I was washing my kettle.

However, just as many many others noticed, it smells funny inside (plastic and metal smell, and maybe glue? Basically- something very toxic and strong).\nThis particular kettle had a couple of dark brown spots on it's side (defect in the ceramic) and a chip in the ceramic at the bottom. I tried to 'accept it' as is with its imperfections and boiled the first batch of water, as they reccomend, before using the kettle. This did NOT get rid of the plastic/toxic smell at all and left some dark spots on the metal plate inside after just this one boil. It looked like rust (brownish color). I should have listened to the bad reviews before ordering, but was too intrigued/attracted by the design of this item. Two stars because the design is so nice, but 1 star for overall functionality and questionable materials used. I ordered another design for a friend. The product was not packaged in the shipping box and the product box was full of holes, dirt and was completely beat up and horrible looking. I can't give this as a gift! I checked quickly inside and the kettle was all dusty and had a chip in the ceramic as well. It also had the toxic smell and the metal disk inside looked scratched. I returned both of them right away.\nWe have used the Japanese brand 2 L boiler for 17 years now (Zajirushi). The first one died after 11 years and the current one is still going. I was looking for a prettier design look and the ceramic sounded much better than whatever Zajirushi has inside of it.

Received it yesterday and love the way it boils quietly and beeps when done, less than 10 mins. Tried the keep warm function and it basically continues to reboil when the water temperature drops which I do not like, wished it was more like a warming plate. Also, I found this ceramic kettle has some silicone plastic sealer inside on the bottom of the stainless steel (see photo).

Filled to the Max with water it weighed 6.6 lbs on my bathroom scale, which does seem heavy, but manageable for me. I have the 1.2 liter model, so the larger one might be very heavy. On the plus side, the ceramic is very attractive.\nI would like to have it make a sound when it finishes boiling.

It heats up the water so fast, in about two minutes you are ready to go! The size is much bigger than I anticipated and it was a pleasant surprise. It looks so cute in my kitchen and when I'm not using it I keep it on display on the counter because it's just so freaking pretty. The little switch to turn it on or off is well made and easy to use, it does shit off automatically when it's done heating up so keep in mind it's not going to keep your pot warm all day but the fact it heats up in 2 minutes make it no big deal. It is fragile so be careful, I banged it against the sink by accident and nothing happened! I got the silver one because it was the cheaper one and I'm so happy with my choice. The silver one looks sooooo much better in person. I just don't understand why the other colors are more expensive??? And the turquoise one is even going for double the price! That's just crazy.

This ceramic kettle heats up super fast and the water is incredibly hot. It actually reaches boiling level so once you pour it in your cup give it a few minutes to cool down.

My main complaint is that the lid is really hard to get off. I wish it was a flip lid. Every time I get it off it's like I win a tug-of-war. My only really good comment is that it's pretty.

I've been using it daily for a couple weeks now and it works exactly as anticipated, similar boil time and auto shut-off. It is heavier than a plastic kettle - but it's far better looking. Another advantage I noticed is that the way the lid is sealed and the spout is shaped, there is far less steam emitted from the top of the kettle while it's boiling.

I do see an issue with the metal & plastic but haven't had any residual taste issues so far.\n\nThe biggest problem we have had is the bottom is metal and it causes major calcium buildup that takes steel wool to scrub off and some of the buildup cannot be reached.

This evening i noticed a puddle of water under the kettle and on top of the heating plate. I started to pour the water into my press and then noticed it was draining from the small holes on the bottom of the kettle. This just started tonight. Havent had a single issue beforehand. I dumped the water, dried the kettle off and then filled it 1/3 of the way up to test again. Leaking pretty good out of the holes. Im irritated. Who can I contact about getting my kettle replaced.

It looks and feels like a fairly expensive kettle, but I paid around $30 for it. The body of this ceramic kettle gets too hot to touch when heated and can be heavy if filled with water, so maybe avoid this one if weak or arthritic hands as you have to pour holding the handle only. We've used it daily for about 6 months and it's still going strong."},{"reviewerName":"Sarahbeth D.","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Love this!!","reviewDate":"November 25, 2016","reviewText":"I wanted a ceramic kettle because there were no plastic pieces to melt and minimal metal to leach into the metal.

I have owned quite a few over the years and, so far, this works as well as any. I was concerned that I might not be able to immediately refill the kettle while it was still hot since it is ceramic. But, based on other customers kind responses to my question I purchased it about 2 months ago -- and using it several times daily -- that has not been a problem.\n\nI have had problems in the past keeping kettles on my kitchen counters as there are no open areas that do not have wall cabinets above them. My previous kettle threw off a great deal of steam and damaged the finish on my wooden cabinet door fronts. I am guessing it is because of the difference in the shape of the spout on this one, but it emits a great deal less steam. That has been a nice bonus feature for me.\n\nDue to my arthritis I was worried about the weight of the unit. If that is a concern for you I found it was only slightly heavier than my previous stainless steel model. This kettle is approximately 6\" in diameter and 9'' tall ( including the top handle on the lid but NOT counting the base, which adds about another 1\".) Empty, the kettle weighs 3 lbs. 14 oz. Filled with water to the maximum line it weighs 6 lbs. 11 oz. It holds 5.5 cups of water at the maximum level mark. I have not found the weight to be a problem -- the bottom of the unit stays cool and you can easily balance the weight by supporting it from underneath, if necessary.\n\nThe lid has a silicone gasket which holds the lid on securely, even when pouring out the last drop. In spite of our hard water, which in the past has deposited unsightly rust stains on some of my previous kettles, I have not had the same problem with this one. I do occasionally clean it out with a little vinegar. I have found it quite easy to keep clean.\n\nI also love the look of it -- I bought the blue Aztec design and it is very pretty with my dinnerware."},{"reviewerName":"MARISOL KONDO","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Five Stars","reviewDate":"June 17, 2018","reviewText":"Love love my kettle it’s soo pretty\nIt’s color blue and white make it fun to coordinate with your blue decor it’s a little on the heavy side when water is in it please be careful use two hands if your hands are petite like mine .

Gets a couple of quarts of water boiling in a few minutes. It is much faster than my stove can even heat up. It is about as quick and draws the same power (measured with a Kill-A-Watt) as the induction cooktop I just picked up. I occasionally preboil water for cooking to reduce heatup times when using my ceramic cooktop stove since it takes so long to heat up.\n\nThere is a silicone or flexible plastic seal that keeps the lid secured while pouring as well as seals the heat in to speed up boiling. There is another seal that plugs the hole in the bottom of the lid. There is also a small plastic cap up the stainless riser tube that I assume houses the pyrometer that the kettle uses to measure water temperature for shutoff. I have not disassembled the kettle yet to determine what the tube is used for and if it will be okay to run it without the cap, but I assume it needs it to prevent moisture from dripping diwn the tube. It may also be a vent for trapped steam should there be a small seep of moisture into the base of the kettle where the electronics and heating element are.\n\nIdeally this would have no plastic, but the amount of plastic in the kettle is minimal enough to not be overly concerning.\nIf the stainless tube is just for a pyrometer, I would prefer to see the tube sealed off. The lid seals can be removed, but caution will be needed when pouring to prevent burning one's hand."},{"reviewerName":"Susanna Young","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Beautiful and Functional","reviewDate":"May 7, 2015","reviewText":"I LOVE this kettle.

Boils water REALLY hot. Not exactly as quick as I thought it would be ...but maybe I'm impatient. You be the judge: I filled the water level to the max line inside of the pot (which is actually about 3/4 up the pot) and it took (drumroll)..... 6 minutes and 6 seconds to boil from the second I flipped the switch until the blue light switch at the base of the pot turned off signalling that the water was ready. In all honesty, it sounds like the water boils around 4+ minutes but I'm afraid to mess up the cycle and remove the pot midway so I let it finish the cycle. I was able to reheat my coffee cup in 45 seconds in the microwave while waiting on this experiment and I'd say my traditional whistle kettle would probably heat water in a similar 5-10 minute frame. BUT... this is a pretty kettle with the silver trim and long neck spout, and it holds a decent amount of water. So I conclude that I like the convenience of heating the water and bringing it directly to the table in a prettier pot than my functional-looking round belly red metal tea kettle. In other words, it is function and serving elegance in one."},{"reviewerName":"MicheleF","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Gorgeous and easy to use","reviewDate":"January 4, 2017","reviewText":"Heavy duty!

I read through the reviews before purchasing it and a lot of people commented about the weight of the kettle. I didn't think it was too heavy or cumbersome when filled with water.\n\nThe one thing that I wish this kettle had was some sort of a bell or alert to let you know that it is done. The off/on switch does make a click noise when the water is done boiling but if you're not paying attention you might miss the click.\n\nOverall, I am very pleased with the purchase.

Easy to use, much larger in size than I anticipated and the cord is longer than some reviewers made it out to be. I do have it sitting on a hot pad for now, as the instructions stated it is best to do so to prevent any damage to the counter-top.\n\nIt quickly heats up and signals it's done by the switch flipping off. I use this kettle to make sweet tea so I usually turn it off immediately after it is done heating, therefore I cannot comment if it stays warm over a said period of time.\nI like that it is stylish, functional, and affordable. I also like that you can hide the cord in the base by wrapping it up, when not in use."},{"reviewerName":"Amazon Joe","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great product.","reviewDate":"June 4, 2017","reviewText":"Bought this for my mom!

It has a smaller footprint and is much more attractive on the countertop, heats just a little faster and much more quietly, and keeps water hot for longer. The handle is on the side instead of on top so it's also easier to refill than the Russell Hobbs was, with much lower risk of steam burns. The only real drawback is that it is heavy, especially when filled. If you have children who might be using it, or if you have small hands, arthritis, or wrist problems, this is not the kettle for you. Another caveat: probably because we are in Alaska, we were charged shipping on checkout even though the page claimed free shipping."},{"reviewerName":"Nikki","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"... mail and when it finally came I couldn't be happier!

Our main reason for using this is the french press coffee we drink in the morning. It is SO much easier than a traditional stovetop kettle. This one has a function that allows you to hold the temperature while you go about your other business. It doesn't have a kettle whistle to drive you bonkers in the early AM. The feature brings it to the desired temperature and holds it there until you are ready for it. It works very well.\n\nThis operates with the touch of a button. As mentioned before, we are french press coffee drinkers and the setting on the kettle brings it to the perfect temperature to use for that (just below full boil). There are settings for various teas, coffees, and cooking implements. All work well. There is also just a choice to go for it!\n\nThe look of this is very nice. It looks beautiful on the countertop. The kettle is a heavy ceramic (glass maybe) and the base is small, which helps it to fit in well on the countertop. It is a bit heavy, so if you have a family member that may struggle with arthritis or struggles that are similar, it may not work. I love the design and with many options, you will find something that works for your kitchen.\n\nI live this a lot. The reason for the 4 stars is cleaning. It is browning a little on the inside, and while I can clean it out it is a bit of a pain.\n\nLove the look and the function of this!"},{"reviewerName":"Shauna","rating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Be ready to deal with horrible customer service after a year","reviewDate":"December 26, 2018","reviewText":" As a grad school student, this teapot was a splurge.

I am wondering if perhaps the quality has gone down, as we purchased five of these kettles... all purchased about four years ago... and they are all used frequently and still going strong. One is at my mother's home (blue/white), one at my son's home (teal/white), one at our home (silver/white), one at my husband's office (gray/white), and one given as a gift to his secretary (teal/white). We liked that they were available in a variety of designs to suit any decor, and the ceramic construction is nice enough to be left out on the counter. As we are all frequent tea drinkers, these pots are generally used 3-5 times minimum each day, and all are still functioning as well as the day they were purchased. The lids sit well, the seals are tight, there are no leaks, and the heating elements work well. Given the number of recent negative reviews, I cannot help but wonder if something changed in the production process at Bella... but the price is still the same as what we paid. Based on our experience with the five we purchased, I highly recommend this tea kettle."},{"reviewerName":"Daffy Du","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Beautiful and functional","reviewDate":"December 1, 2018","reviewText":"I'm a fan generally of electric kettles--they boil water way faster than kettles on my stove, and given all the hummingbird nectar I cook up every day, that's a real plus. I've been using a mundane but functional Hamilton Beach stainless steel kettle for several years, and I love it, but it's starting to show its age, and its only a matter of time before it needs replacing.\n\nI'm not interested in plastic kettles, not wanting whatever chemicals can leach from the plastic into the water. But this one caught my eye because it's glass, and it's really, really attractive.\n\nFrom a functional POV, it boils water effectively, though not quite as fast as my Hamilton Beach kettle--but certainly acceptably. I haven't had the problem with dripping that other reviewers have mentioned, apart from a drop or two at the spout--certainly nothing to get upset over. And it doesn't seem especially heavy to me. The blue LEDs around the base are a nice, albeit unnecessary, touch, and I like that the gauge window on the side is large enough for you to tell when it's boiling, not just the water level. But that gauge window is the reason I deducted a star--it's on the wrong side for me to watch while I'm filling it because I'm right handed, and there's only one way I can orient the kettle while I'm filling it. In order to see the level, I have to stop pouring and turn it around, then turn it back around to continue filling it. (I use filtered water, so don't fill from the tap, but the issue would be the same regardless.) Why they didn't put a gauge window on both sides, as Procter-Silex did with one my friend has, I don't know. But as it's configured, it really only works to rely on the gauge window while you're filling the kettle if you're left handed.\n\nApart from that, it's a great kettle, and I'll continue to use it.\n\nFour solid stars."},{"reviewerName":"TOPJOB7","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"UPDATE: Lid sticks and breaks ... Beautiful and functional!","reviewDate":"April 16, 2019","reviewText":"Update 10/19: (1/5 stars)\n\nThe lid sticks tightly and when you pull can suddenly pop off. Since it breaks easily, we were careful but eventually one time it popped off and broke on our tile floor since it is ceramic. Unfortunately, the manufacturer cannot provide replacement parts so now the kettle is useless. They need a better gasket and should make parts available!\n\nOriginal review: (4/5 stars)\n\nI do love it! I got this despite some negative reviews because it's a pretty ceramic kettle with various temperature options. I would love it more if it was the size of a large teapot. Instead it's a huge 7.5 cup capacity which is a bit heavy. I never boil that much hot water. I only ever boil 2 cups/16 oz. which is the minimum it can boil. 5 cup capacity would be plenty.\n\nBlue lights show the settings and it beeps when hot. It has a \"keep warm\" button if you want it to hold that temperature - then it will turn off after two hours. (Or if all the water boils off, which I tested and it does work!)\n\nThe plastic ring keeps the lid from falling off. The controls work and there are no leaks. Perhaps it will crack if bumped. Just don't put in cold water while its hot - wait till it cools."},{"reviewerName":"Oliver DeMille, TJEd","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"This is not the same pitcher as the one that got abismal reviews on this same page.","reviewDate":"November 28, 2018","reviewText":"I feel sorry that the manufacturer has combined the product I received on the same product page with the one that got so many complaints for design and construction defects. I got a beautiful, 5-star pitcher with none of the problems described!\n\nFirst, it *does* have a window to allow you to see how much water is in it, and you can watch it boil. Second, it boils quickly - even as you watch (dispelling the old wive's tail about the watched pot, etc.). Third, the top pops up easily with a push button release. It pours gently, and a little slowly. Very easy to control and get just the right amount. The finish on the chrome is a gorgeous copper color that looks phenomenal on our granite counter with warm tones.\n\nI LOVE that is has 360-degree lateral spin on the base. I have 2 other electric kettles, and the fact that it has to nest super precisely to be correctly on the base is the one thing I hate about them - but I had no idea someone had come up with a fix for it! If you haven't experienced the other kind (if this pitcher is your only foray into electric kettles) please know that this is an AWESOME feature.\n\nIt warms quickly, and has a wide-open interior that's super easy to clean. Here is another way in which it is superior to my other pitchers: they have an exposed element right inside, and it accumulates mineral deposits. Sure, you can clean them with white vinegar, but with this unit, just wiping it out every few times will keep deposits from accumulating - plus, there's nothing in the way of it getting cleaned out completely, with no weird angles or cracks to deal with.\n\nI LOVE THIS PITCHER. It's a vast improvement over the 3 other pitchers we own, and clearly not the same thing as the beleaguered ones that have gotten such poor reviews on this page.

They're very different kettles, so pay attention to the reviews specific to the one you're interested in. My review is for the Copper Chrome kettle.\n\nThe kettle itself is stylish and looks good on a counter or table for serving.\n\nThe glass on the side makes it easy to see your water level.\n\nWater heats quickly, though not quite as quickly as my old kettle. Still, it's faster than putting a regular kettle on a burner.\n\nUnfortunately, this kettle does not have a temperature setting. That's probably not an issue for people who are using this for black tea, hot chocolate, etc. But for people like me, who drink a variety of tea types, temperature control is important. (Each type of tea is best made with a specific water temperature.)

I've switched back to the Ovente kettle. It's lighter and the water indicator is on the front which makes it easier to fill. The Bella kettle has great build quality, so it's a higher quality kettle. But better usability won out over overall quality.\n\nOriginal review:\n\nI like this a lot. I have a couple of Ovente kettles which are nice enough but rather cheaply made. This Bella kettle is much higher quality. It's ceramic vs metal and the top seals so no water comes out of it. This actually makes the top a little difficult to remove. For someone that's older this might be a problem. The kettle itself is also much heavier than the Ovente as the ceramic material adds a lot of weight. Not a problem for me, but if I was looking for a kettle for my 80 year old mom, I'd think twice about it. But again, it's much higher quality than the Ovente.\n\nSince I drink a lot of green tea I need a kettle with temperature controls. This has easy, intuitive controls on the base.\n\nOverall an excellent, multi-temperature kettle which has become my new go-to kettle."},{"reviewerName":"Grimmy","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"A nice-looking kettle","reviewDate":"November 28, 2018","reviewText":"I really like the look of this kettle. The color of the outside material is really attractive. Involves water OK, just make sure to fill it to at least the minimum line (although I found it does still boil if about 1/2\" below that line). It has a neat glowing blue light while it boils. It shuts itself off after the water has reached boiling point. Note, however, it does not have a keep warm feature, although if you need more hot water soon after the first pour it'll heat it up soon enough.\n\nThe one issue I have with this item is that the outside of the kettle gets hot to the touch. After a couple of uses at a time, you will find that the handle, around the top third where your thumb would be, also gets quite warm. If you are careful about this it should not be a problem, but if there are children are around you should be aware of this. Actually, if there is anyone else around you should make them aware that you have just used it to boil water and therefore it may be hot. UPDATE: I've found that other models/brands also get hot on the outside, e.g. Black and Decker, Hamilton Beach, etc. So it seems normal for this to happen, just be aware of it.\n\nIt makes it easy to boil water because of its auto shut off feature, which is easier than putting a tea pot on the stove, which you will have to shut off yourself.

I selected this item because my electric kettle was on its last legs and ready to be recycled as a planter. I like electric kettles so when I saw this product, it looked like it would improve on my current one and it did.\n\nThe black and white floral graphic is pretty. It is bigger (and heavier) than I thought it would be but I'm okay with that. It was easy to set up and use. The one grumble that I have with my current pot is that the wide spout would spill outside of where I was pouring, no matter how careful I was. The spout on this tea kettle is longer and narrower so it is accurate when it is poured. The hardest part of cleaning is that it is heavier than expected but otherwise, it is straightforward to clean. Lastly, it is so convenient to have. I drink at least 3 cups of tea through the day and not always the same kind. In the morning, I can pour the hot water into my glass kettle to make my English breakfast tea. In the afternoon (or evening), I can pour directly into my cup for hibiscus, jasmine or my favorite peppermint green tea.

The main downside for me is the spout design, which makes it difficult to pour without some water dripping. I do not have this issue with my other kettles. However, I have not had the leaking issue that some others have reported. In terms of speed, the kettle takes 9 minutes to come to a rolling boil when filled in the 1.8 L version. This is a bit longer than my other kettles, but it also holds heat longer because of the ceramic, so it is a draw.\n\nIn terms of style, this kettle is by far the most beautiful one I have seen, including plastic and metal. The controls are touch and very straightforward. Instead of tapping the power button to scroll through temperatures, you just touch the temperature you want. Yes, it is heavy, which is a plus for me.\n\nIf you want a kettle that looks more at home in a country kitchen, this is a decent choice. The dripping is a little annoying, but I still enjoy it."},{"reviewerName":"Beth A.","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"It's ok","reviewDate":"March 4, 2014","reviewText":"I bought this for about $50 from Target. I have had three stainless steel kettles in the last ten years. The last two were complete junk, and the last one even rusted. I decided not to trust the quality of steel kettles anymore and didn't want clear glass either. I liked the traditional shape of this one, but I'm not crazy about the painted design (I did not downgrade for the design, however).\n\nAll-in-all, it's ok. It is better than my last two stainless kettles - but the fill line is about halfway up the pot and doesn't hold the amount of water in one boil that I need. I am also not convinced that the rubber seal on the lid is going to last as long as the rest of it.\n\nIf you've ever had ceramic sugar bowls or canisters it will develop that same cruddy feeling on the outside of it that will require regular washing instead of Clorox wiping & polishing which you can do with stainless appliances. The lid is not attached to the pot and can be completely immersed for washing. To wash the pot itself, wash it upside-down and gently spray-rinse it so no water runs into the electrical components on the bottom.\n\nEdited December 12, 2014 - I ended up returning this one because the aforementioned issues did not justify the price I paid for it. Surprisingly enough, I bought the (cheaper) Hamilton Beach red stainless steel kettle because it was the only one under $50 that I liked. It has held up nicely for about eight months. It's beautiful too and the red color is a nice pop for my mostly white and stainless kitchen.\n\nEdited October 5, 2015 - I am still using the red stainless Hamilton Beach kettle. It is easy to clean, has not rusted, hasn't leaked. It does take slightly too long to turn off after boiling, but given that it hasn't been a total rip-off or piece of junk like my last few kettles, I'm happy with it."},{"reviewerName":"Francis Tapon","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Perfect for tea aficionados","reviewDate":"March 20, 2019","reviewText":"Confession: at first I didn't like this kettle.\nIt was too complicated for my eighty-year-old mother. She just wants to boil water. But after thinking about it, I realized that some people might have different values. For instance, the control panel is flat and so it makes it easy to clean.\n\nSecond, once I opened up the manual, I could see that different teas require different temperatures. I had no idea about that. So if you are a tea Aficionado, you probably would love such a kettle. I never knew that people were so finicky about the temperature of the water for their tea. Obviously, there is a whole subculture for tea nuts.\n\nIf you're part of that culture, then you would love this kettle. If you just want to boil water each and every time, you can do that with this, but you might want to consider ones that have a more simple interface. They just have a simple switch and don't give you all these options."},{"reviewerName":"DelusionalAngel","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Loved it ‘til it died","reviewDate":"February 15, 2019","reviewText":"Update: i downgraded my review. I loved this kettle so much I gave away my old one. Sadly it died in May. I started using it in February. No response from the company after two weeks so I’ve given up on getting any kind of CS and got a different brand. This was an unacceptable lifespan for a kettle like this. Super disappointing.\n\nOriginal review 5/5 stars: So far I love this (will update if that changes).\n\nMy old kettle had just on and off and no warming feature. So for me this is a major step up. It has multiple temperature settings (lists both the temp + what it’s ideal for). Great for those who drink many types of teas but who don’t have the temps memorized (me). Easy to use - fill, choose temp setting, when it’s done hit the keep warm setting if you won’t need the water for awhile.\n\nIt something happened to it, I’d probably buy another and will donate my old kettle because this is so much nicer."},{"reviewerName":"LawyerMom","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"LOVE","reviewDate":"February 17, 2019","reviewText":"I LOVE this tea kettle! I was expecting something like the plastic water kettles that I've used during my travels in Europe and Asia (where they are much more popular) but was pleasantly surprised to open up this package and find a heavy, ceramic kettle! I MUCH prefer to be using a ceramic kettle (there is a metal plate in the bottom) than drinking boiling water made in a plastic container. Even the cap is ceramic, but there is a silicone ring around the bottom, to hold the cap tightly in place. The design is very pretty, looks like a marbled counter. And I was surprised there were no buttons on the hot plate. It's a touch surface glass (like with a smartphone). You touch the temperature you want the water to heat to, and it lights up. So simple to use. I would highly recommend and would definitely gift this item over and over for friends for housewarming gifts."},{"reviewerName":"Bradley Olin","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Whisper Quiet, Efficient","reviewDate":"February 18, 2019","reviewText":"This kettle is fantastic, it looks great in our kitchen, and boils water more rapidly and quietly than our previous electric kettle. Access to the fill top is easy, it holds plenty of water to make tea or fill our french press, and the temperature selection options help ensure that the water is the right temperature for the right application so you don't wind up with burnt tasting green tea, or weak coffee. I still can't wrap my head around how much quieter and faster it is than our old electric kettle, which wasn't all that old. If you're looking for an upgrade, look no further!\n\nTake note: The kettle is made of ceramic and is already kind of heavy. When it's full, people with frail wrists or carpal tunnel syndrome should take care when lifting off the base as it can be quite heavy.

The other downside is that the Max level in the kettle is WAY lower than that is labeled. When I filled it to the max line it splattered and boiled over big time. The spout is great and pours nicely without any leaks. You can use it with loose leaf tea in it but I haven’t tried it yet.

So if you want your green tea or oolong made from exactly the right temperature of water, this is the pot for you. It heats quickly. Pours neatly. Holds the temperature. Its easy to use. Shuts off so it doesn't cook dry.\n\nThings you need to take into consideration: The pot is heavy when full. The lid, which has a nice seal to it, is also hard to get off if your hands are arthritic. You can only put water in it. So it's not an all purpose sort of pot for heating liquids to preset temperatures.

I highly reccomend it!"},{"reviewerName":"Boris Polonskiy","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"I would not recommend (unless you like to play Russian roulette","reviewDate":"October 15, 2017","reviewText":"I bought it in Walmart on May 15 and it died on Oct 15 (just after 5 months!)\nVery low reliability!\n\nI had few electric kettles before in a couple of years and they all still working (!).

Except every so often I have to take the plastic Bottom of and re attach the heating recepticle. One of the plastics prongs broke off and if one of my kids try to use it they drop it on the pedestal and end up knocking the whole black piece in the picture into the base. Which prevents the unit from turning on.\n\nI just remove the three Philips head screws and lock back into place. The fourth screw I threw away because ir was a triangle and annoying to take a triangle screw out."},{"reviewerName":"ZTay","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"I love love love my kettle","reviewDate":"December 17, 2016","reviewText":"I love love love my kettle... since I am not a coffee drinker, I thought getting a kettle would be a good idea but I didn't want one that went on the stove... this kettle is pleasant to the eye on the counter top and is definitely a conversation piece for my company... the water also heats really fast.

After about 9-10 months of use, at least once per day, I noticed leakage. The pot had cracked...minuscule cracks that weren’t visible except for the steady dip-drop of water along the sides. At first I couldn’t figure out where it was coming from. Very pretty, but not well made.
