Then one morning hit the start lever and went about getting ready for work, returned to the kitchen to find that the unit was boiling water like crazy, water all over the counter and dripping down on my hardwood floor, unit almost boiled dry and would have if given a few more minutes. Tried the unit again after letting it dry out completely and the same thing, did not shut off, just kept heating until the water was ready to blow out the top. Contacted Hamilton Beach as I was just outside the return window and they were happy to send me a new unit as long as I paid SHIPPING AND HANDLING $12 BUCKS. I purchased on a lightning deal for $16 Thanks a bunch HAMILTON BEACH. So in the recycle bin and I will never buy a Hamilton beach product again.

So something small, not to take too much space and preferably fast was needed. Since I live in dorms and I am not all the time in the room, I couldn’t go with something super cheap and neglect the safety aspect, but at the same time my budget is a bit limited since I am still a student.\n\nThis water boiler was the perfect solution for me since it took into consideration all my concerns. I very much trust the brand, the price is affordable and it is small and fast!\n\nI bought the refurbished one, which made it even cheaper and I feel better for recycling! I have been using it for over half a year and so far never experienced any problems and have no complaints at all. Definitely recommend to anyone who needs a small fast water boiler!\n\nUpdate: Sept 7, 2017\n\nI wanted to add that I have been using this now for quite a while and am still super satisfied with it! Nothing ever malfunctioned or broke!"},{"reviewerName":"Anguel","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"This thing sucks","reviewDate":"January 7, 2016","reviewText":"I didn't even know a tea kettle could suck it's like the simplest thing in the world. I have no idea how you can screw this up. I'm pretty mad thing leaked all over the place and popped my breaker. Left it on went to the other room for a few min came back when I heard a pop. There was a huge puddle around the kettle. Then when I picked it up boiling water just went everywhere. Looked under it and it was leaking out like a faucet.

Somehow turning the gas stove on for a single cup of tea didn't make much sense to me. My family, however, insisted on using the kettle, as they firmly believed that tea from the microwave was gross. They were right, it wasn't the same but I needed to find a happy medium. Something fast and measured. I liked this little kettle so much that I bought one for me and two to give. It is the perfect utilitarian gift for tea and instant coffee drinkers. It boils fast, looks good on the counter and is well priced. It is also easy to clean. I would say this kettle is the most used gadget in our kitchen... or a close competitor to the microwave. I highly recommend this electric kettle."},{"reviewerName":"MahNaz","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great for Everyone in Our House","reviewDate":"May 31, 2017","reviewText":"It's one of those things we didn't think we needed until we bought and now we can't live without because of ease of use. No more worrying about tea boiling over in the microwave or on the stove and much more energy efficient. We use it in our house multiple times a day for tea, oatmeal, or instant ramen. It's nice for single serve as well as large quantities for multiple cups of tea or oatmeal. I timed it for heating one cup comfortably within a minute. It's definitely much faster than trying to boil tea in a kettle for one person or microwaving.\n\nMy grandfather also sometimes forgot to turn off the stove after boiling hot water for himself, so this is a significantly safer alternative for him.\n\nI purchased this in November of 2016. No rusting or spots noted like some of the other reviewers, as of yet, but I also drain out any remaining water after boiling as per the instructions."},{"reviewerName":"David A Clayburn","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Mine has leaked from the bottom since the day I bought it. I hate this thing.","reviewDate":"August 7, 2018","reviewText":"I fill the water to the fill line put it on the base plug it in and flip the switch. It does boil water quickly and efficiently but not so much safely. as soon as the water starts to boil the liquid starts to come out of the bottom and run all over my counter and down to the floor. I have stopped using it since as I was afraid that it would cause a short since its not suppose to do that. Mine was a real safety hazard and I didn't keep the box so I didn't feel I could return it.

Since it was a brand X product that I rescued from a close-out bin, I figured I had nowhere to go but up. Imagine my surprise when I went to place this Hamilton Beach pot on its heating base AND IT WOBBLED. I must have spent 10 minutes trying to get a solid seat, orienting it this way and that, getting my magnifiers to look for a hidden tab or slot that might enable it to dock securely. Finally, I realized that it is just another cheaply made product churned out by the thousands by underpaid workers in some sweatshop in China. Since I have it on my kitchen counter in an area that is relatively free from activity and clutter, I can live with it, but if you are buying this for a more crowded space where it might get bumped, this is something to consider. And maybe I got the one that slipped through quality control, and YMMV.\n\nAnyway, what I like about it is that it is one liter (not a lot of choice in this size) and boils water quite quickly. It might be a bit difficult to clean the inside if you have large hands: the lid pops up 90 degrees, but the opening is still a bit small. Oh, and the lid gets hot when the water boils, so if you reuse it right away you might need a hot pad to close it. Lastly, it was not shipped in a box. A mailing label was simply slapped right on the product box which, since it wasn’t made to withstand the rigors of the USPS, arrived crushed on one side. Fortunately this didn’t affect the product that I could see."},{"reviewerName":"Primomama","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"like a toy kettle","reviewDate":"April 13, 2018","reviewText":"It does the job. So 5 starts for that.\n\nBut it feels cheap, like a toy kettle. It’s very light weight which should be a good thing but it’s so light that it wobbles on the heating stand. This makes me a little nervous. This is my first Hamilton Beach product. I’m not impressed. It definitely doesn’t feel like $20+ quality, more like $10. I’m regretting that I didn’t spend extra money but oh well. I could’ve returned but I needed it since my Aroma kettle died after 5 years of good usage."},{"reviewerName":"rezna","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Super fast!!!","reviewDate":"May 3, 2019","reviewText":"There are some misleading negative reviews on this boiler. I think there are some people putting too much water in the carafe before they boil, and thus they are getting overflow and foam and such. Fill it to the line where it says lol. The water boils SO FAST!!!! It's the perfect amount to make two 16 oz cups of tea, or coffee. I use this for making tea and for my AeroPress. It's totally awesome, I haven't had any issues yet.\n\nThe one downside is the length of the plug/cord. It's super small and very short. I had to get an extension for this to work in my office.

This morning, I tried to turn it on, and the clear, illuminated switch at the base of the handle, that turns it on to start heating, was broken.\n\nI took it apart and it is hard to believe that this company would make the switch so weak. This switch has two arms in the base that extend into the base to work as a lever to make the switch connection. where these two arms extend into the handle to the illuminated switch, those arms connect to the illuminated switch on both sides with only a 1/16\" thick clear plastic that simply breaks after a period of time. No way to avoid this breaking. I think the temperature that this clear plastic sees from the bottom heating element degrades the plastic over time so that it has to fail.\n\nBuilt in obsolescence so that you have to buy another one.\n\nAmazing that the rest of the pot seems to be very heavy duty, and heats great. For this poor switch design to be included seems just out of place."},{"reviewerName":"taosaur","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Probably beats most 2-3 times the price","reviewDate":"January 25, 2019","reviewText":"3 weeks in, I can't speak to longevity, but it's holding up well to frequent daily use. The bottom interior did spot a bit as seen in other people's images, but nothing concerning. The main downsides are the overly complex, insufficiently robust plastic mechanisms in the lid, and the unnecessary fill level window. Both of these areas are opportunities for failure and/or cleaning issues, where simpler design would have been better. As someone with decent spatial reasoning, I know how much liquid is in the pot. The only pots I've seen on Amazon that didn't have those issues were much more expensive and have worse issues. It gets the job done, pretty quickly, and without too much noise."},{"reviewerName":"Johnson in GRMI","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Oh my goodness! I LOVE THIS!","reviewDate":"May 5, 2016","reviewText":"I was worried that going to a 1 liter pot from my old 1.7 liter pot would be a problem, but the new one is actually easier to lift and carry and quicker to heat to boiling. It really does heat to a boil faster than in a microwave - and it's probably safer, too, as some believe microwaves change the chemistry of your food and beverages. It's a most beautifully designed pot, too, when compared to the other electric kettles for the price. Many reviews suggest heating only water in it, but with the flat stainless steel surface and no heating elements exposed inside, I don't know why you couldn't heat other things, too. Definitely send it to college with your favorite student, or buy it for Mother's Day, especially if she's a senior citizen. It's so practical! No fear of burning the house down because it shuts itself off once the contents reach a boil. It's cheaper than a bouquet of flowers and will last so much longer. This is my favorite purchase in a long time!"},{"reviewerName":"Nancy N.","rating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Worked great for 7 months","reviewDate":"January 29, 2017","reviewText":"I bought this electric kettle in June of 2016.

I'm using filtered water that boils fine when using other pots, so I know the smell is coming from the kettle.\n\nOn closer look, I noticed that several of the internal parts seems to be made of plastic.

Except if you need one with a higher capacity than 1L - there are models that hold 1.5-2Ls - I can see no reason to pay a penny more. They all boil water, nothing more. They do not polish your silver or iron your shirts. Not highly scientific at all. I've been using the one I bought for a month, at least twice a day.

Five, it's just the right size for one or two people -- I don't need bigger than 1 liter, ever! Six, the top puts up with a spring release which is pretty cool. And seven -- well, hoping it lasts forever, but that may be pushing it since I got this for like $16. as an Amazon Deals item which had clearly never been opened, just a crinkled box.

Rinsed it out, filled it with filtered water and heated it up. Boiled and shut off in about 4 minutes. I only have two minor complaints, but for the price they aren't a huge deal.\n\nFirst of all the cord is extremely short, I will have to invest in an appropriate extension cord in order to use it where I want.\n\nSecond, I did not realize when I bought this that it is single wall stainless. The kettle is not insulated. It gets pretty hot when there is boiling water in it. I missed when I went to pick it up and almost burned myself. An insulated cozy or a sleeve would easily fix this, but upon cursory glance at the web I didn't see anything that would fit.\n\nAll in all, it seems to be fine.

Water heats up fast, and heats to a roiling boil.\n\nCons: The stainless steel body conducts heat VERY well, and since the water gets up to boiling, it gets hot enough to burn your fingers. Added to that, the styling LOOKS like there's some sort of insulating layer to keep the water hot and the surface cool. This is not the case. I'm a grown adult and *probably* should have figured this out prior to burning the backs of my index and middle fingers on the metal surface, so some of this comes to user error, but I would be very hesitant to bring this into a household with children."},{"reviewerName":"Teacher MN","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"So worth the money--you will love it!","reviewDate":"September 27, 2017","reviewText":"So far, this device has been fantastic!

It meets all these expectations easily.\n\nWhat I didn't expect was that it would boil a liter of water and still be completely cool to the touch, so I could pick it up and pour without needing an oven mitt (my hands are very sensitive to heat; I always need insulation with stove-top kettles).\n\nSo yeah, it's perfect so far."},{"reviewerName":"k gannon","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Works great.

Only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it draws a lot of power quickly and it blew a fuse in my house when it was running at the same time as another high draw appliance. Not the company's fault there but I just wanted others to know if they have an older home this is still a good kettle just watch if you use it at the same time as other appliances."},{"reviewerName":"Laura Watson","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Recommending for quickly heating water for beverages","reviewDate":"October 14, 2018","reviewText":"This pot is very easy to use. We use filtered water. The viewing panel makes it easy to see how much water is in the pot without opening the lid. After heating, the water in the pot stays hot for quite awhile. Dispensing of the hot water into a mug or cup is smooth and you don't need to push a button. It rinses and wipes clean. There is an auto-off feature so the water can't boil away if you walk away from it.

This one, has a lot of water capacity too and is not as heavy as the other when lifting. It shuts off automatically and heats the water just right and pretty fast.

This kettle isn't gorgeous or anything, but it lasts forever and its volume is reasonable. For tea and cooking single servings of pasta, etc. it's very adequate. The previous kettle we had was this gorgeous glass thing that cost around $60 and it broke after two months; this one's $20 and still going strong.\n\nIf the calcium buildup from tap water bothers you, you can clean it pretty easily; the opening is big enough to fit a hand and sponge in.

Heat 1-liter, 3 times, to make a 3-liter pitch of tea for the week. The very first liter out of the box was flawless, but each of the 5 liters afterwards have been frustrating, because the switch doesn’t want to stay down. I suspect this is due to the less-than-snug connection with the base. I read about this in another review. I also dinged this on ease-of-cleaning, since you,d have to have a 6-year old’s hand to fit inside. I might hunt down those bogus answers in the Q&A.

There IS plastic in contact with the water.","reviewDate":"May 24, 2018","reviewText":"The minimum water level is a bit large, at 0.6L. Also, while there is no exposed element, this is unsuitable for heating liquids other than water. The reason is that the fluid indicator is plastic (somewhat defeating the purpose of the rest of the kettle being stainless) and the tiny hole (1/8ʺ or 3.2mm) opening into a larger cavity creates a space that cannot quickly dry. If anything other than water got inside, I would expect it to begin molding relatively quickly. Otherwise I do like the kettle, the lid that remains open on its own spring tension help keep the inside dry to prevent mold, etc. Also, it can be replaced on its base in any orientation."},{"reviewerName":"YX98","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Good kettle, short cord","reviewDate":"December 6, 2017","reviewText":"Only used it for a few times now, so far working pretty well. It boils water fairly quickly (about less than 5 minutes), and has been working quite well for me to cook instant noodles and make tea. The cord of the kettle is really short though. The cord is connected to the kettle, which makes it easy to tidy the cord after use, but the cord cannot be extended. It is hard for me to connect the kettle on the table to the power strip on the floor, so I ended up using an additional power strip. The socket needs to be close to the place where the kettle is put on in order for the cord to be long enough."},{"reviewerName":"Nana","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Perfect for a single person to use","reviewDate":"July 3, 2019","reviewText":"This is suitable for a single person use.\nI drink coffee every morning (a cup at home and bring the rest to work in 12 oz thermos).

It can't be turned on. The switch stopped working after only a week. It's stuck in the off position. I can push down on the switch to turn it on but it won't click into place and stay.\n\nI was looking for a stainless kettle because I don't want to boil water in plastic. This was great because even though there is a window, the water does not come into contact with any plastic except when pouring through the removable filter. I would like this kettle enough if it worked but it's cheap and cheaply made.\n\nAlthough not related to the product, I advise against buying from this seller. I would personally not buy from them again. I ordered this because the price was low (about $19) and reviews seemed comparable to other similar items I was looking at. When I didn't receive it after several days, I checked my order and found that they were not going to ship it. For some reason, it was unavailable. So I placed another order but the price was suddenly around $30. What?! I needed one and didn't have time to go back and research again, so I ordered it anyway. When I went to return it the price is set to $19.10 again! That's pretty sketchy, if you ask me.\n\nPros:\nWater level window without contact with plastic\nLooks great\nDoesn't take up a lot of counter space\nBoils water quickly\nsmall handle is great for my small hands\nflip top lid\neasy to fill\nremovable filter\nshort cord can wind under base I can wind it once and it's just enough cord to reach the outlet above it (could be a con for some but I like my countertop cords to be limited)\n\nCons:\nBroke after about a week of use\nOnly one temperature setting (boiling)\nSomewhat narrow opening makes cleaning more difficult than some kettles\n(Sketchy seller)"},{"reviewerName":"Yukun Yu","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"As always, serves my breakfast tea.","reviewDate":"July 12, 2019","reviewText":"Primarily used for boiling water serving my hot tea in the morning, energizing the day.

Using the microwave makes my cup handle uncomfortably hot so I'd use 1 cup to warm my water and another to drink whatever I was making. Both ways just seemed inconvenient and I've bought a stovetop kettle that I used twice before I donated it. I can't give an exact reason why I didn't like that - but the coffeemaker was my method of choice until I bought this. As much as I hate giving up more counter space to a dedicated appliance, I really think this is worth giving it up. The reviews are correct - this boils water faster than anything else in my house and I'm talking full rolling boil. Usually I need about 16 oz at a time and it'll boil by the time I can prepare a cup with teabags. It holds about 4 cups which is about as much boiling water as I ever need. It's as easy as it gets. The hot plate stays plugged in all the time but it doesn't activate til a switch on the back of the pot is flipped. Another button on top the handle flips the lid open, but it doesn't separate from the pot so nothing to lose or drop. Once filled with however much water is needed - and there is a see through scale in back of pot, flip the lid closed. Sit the pot on the plate - I don't think there is anyway to sit it on incorrectly and the pot swivels freely to put the handle out of the way. Flip the boiling switch and in a flash, water will boil. I don't know how it works but the switch flips off by itself once it reaches a full boil - so handy. The finish is nice. I have nothing to fault it for. I've seen reviews where people have indicated the finish floating into the water. Well, that is the water not this device. I filter my water before boiling it because water here is so hard. Superheating water can cause minerals to precipitate in the water."},{"reviewerName":"Kindle Customer","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great for home and office","reviewDate":"June 29, 2016","reviewText":"I liked it so much that they got one for our office...It works really fast and\nnow I get hot tea anytime."},{"reviewerName":"Jill Wilbur","rating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Has a plug","reviewDate":"May 16, 2018","reviewText":"Wanted a battery operated kettle with no plug."},{"reviewerName":"Sahar Manley","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Super easy to use","reviewDate":"January 28, 2017","reviewText":"This was the bargain of the century for me because I make tea for myself all day long.

The white spots you're seeing are most likely mineral deposits (spring water also contains minerals). I've used only distilled water in mine and, after many uses, it is still pristine inside.\n\nI also suggest leaving the lid open for a while after emptying out the hot water. Allow the residual heat of the metal to evaporate any remaining water droplets inside before closing the lid.\n\nI hope this is helpful.

It also works well; heats up water in about a minute. BUT...the design of this product is kind of a fail:\n\n- The flip-top lid (as with a lot of electric kettles) isn't removable so cleaning the lid (which is made of plastic, another meh) is difficult. The lid is also attached from the inside, which then blocks part of the opening into the kettle when you're trying to clean it, making it awkward to get to all these nooks and crannies that you can't even reach with a toothbrush.\n- I also don't like that the interior portion of the lid is made of plastic. Steam is hotter than boiling water so inadvertently, as the water boils, the plastic inside can melt/degrade INTO your water. I don't even know if it's BPA-free plastic!\n- There's this thin, metal \"rod\" looking thing inside that runs along the entire height of the kettle. Perhaps it's part of the heating unit or encases wires, but it's located near the wall of the kettle, without touching the wall. It creates a narrow space between the kettle and this rod that is, again, difficult to clean.\n\nMaybe I'm being too much of a clean/health freak but you have to give these things a good washing every so often and with the way the product is designed, I couldn't even give it a good initial wash before use."},{"reviewerName":"Benegesserit","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"This is a very nice product for the price. I like it, and it works just fine.","reviewDate":"December 11, 2016","reviewText":"I like it. The five stars is because for the price it does just what it says and does it well. The only drawback (other than being made in China like practically everything) I can see so far is that the base feels really cheap and it is wobbly when you put the empty pot on it. But when the water is in the kettle it is stable enough. Contrary to the plastic phobes out there, the plastic lid does not touch the water and you can remove the scale strainer. The plastic is NOT going to melt from steam. The person who says steam is hotter than boiling water and could melt the lid is just plain wrong. There is no glue in the spout. I don't know what that other person is talking about. The spout is soldered on. Not glued. It is metal people. Mine works fine. It turns off after the water is rapidly boiling for about 30 seconds or so... but it does turn off. It is the perfect size for one person. 1 liter is 33 ounces ish. So you get about 4 cups of water. Fill only to the max line or it may boil over. It is designed for WATER only. Do not make tea or coffee directly in it. For the price, this is a very nice product. For someone who wants something better, you will need to spend more money. I pour any extra water out right away when it is still hot and put it back on the base on the counter to store it. No rust so far. I leave the lid open so it can dry. I got mine at a local big box store. Amazon has the lower price."},{"reviewerName":"Matthias Q Shellelagh","rating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Somewhere, a village dressed their idiot like an engineer, and Hamilton Beach hired him to make a kettle.","reviewDate":"March 8, 2018","reviewText":"There was no real testing. There couldn't have been. In a fair and rational world, any team of even substandard engineers would realize that a gigantic black plastic band mated to a wholly different material (the barest definition of stainless steel) that juts a centimeter out on all sides from the base of the kettle just might be a spot for water to seep out.\n\nIt functions, in that you put water in it, it gets hot, and you occasionally descale it. But throughout the process hot water will spray forth, dribbling down your leg, onto the counter, onto your toddlers head.\n\nSpend your money where it will really benefit you. like crystal meth or tide pods."},{"reviewerName":"Wonky","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"I really like this item","reviewDate":"July 2, 2017","reviewText":"It is nice looking. It does make a lot of white noise while heating but because it is so convenient I overlook that. I drink coffee and tea often. There are two considerations that may make it easier to get along with. First I measure the amount of water I need then pour it into the kettle. That way I am not heating water I will not use and when I have poured there is nothing left inside the kettle. Second after the pour of the hot water I flip open the lid so that I can be sure the kettle dries out quickly. I am hoping this approach will make it last a bit longer. A plastic 500 ml cylinder (which Amazon sells) makes the process simple and precise. For example, 450 ml of water (a large mug) is boiling in 2.5 minutes.

The only thing I might ding this unit on, is the owners manual says the unit turns off when the water has reached boiling. I haven't seen mine do that yet - but I might not be letting the water boil long enough to do that. I usually turn it off manually as soon as I hear the water boiling.

I gave my older hot pot to my boys when they left for college, because I was excited to try something nicer/newer. This stainless one seemed like a good fit, because of its size and a few other features. So far, I love how fast it heats and how long it stays hot, but I wish it had more options as far as the amount of water I can heat.\nPROS\n--Smaller design is perfect for my use. 1 liter (about a quart) maximum gets me a couple large cups of coffee out of my french press, or several smaller cups of herb tea for me and my girls.\n--Stays very hot FOREVER! I love that the water heats, then stays steaming hot for hours.\n--The top stays open automatically. When I dump the hot water, I can set the hotpot on the counter with the lid open and let it dry naturally.\n--There is no heating element inside, unlike with my older hot pot. This means I can make oatmeal, ramen, easy mac, or herb tea right in the pot, without having to transfer to another container. Then I can serve into different dishes or mugs.\n-- Easy to clean because there is no heating element in the inside of the pot.\n\nCONS\n--The minimum amount is about 20 ounces, which is more than I'd like to do sometimes. I wish I could heat just 8 or 10 ounces, which would be super quick if I just want a cup of hot tea in the middle of the night.\n--The difference between the minimum (.6 liters) and the maximum (1 liter) is pretty minor. I find myself filling, then realizing I haven't filled enough, then overfilling and having to throw some out. Silly, but annoying.\n\nOverall, GREAT product for the price!!! I would buy it again, and will probably get one for my college kids so they can make ramen and oatmeal more easily."},{"reviewerName":"Kimberly Fernandez","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Fine but goofy design","reviewDate":"March 16, 2018","reviewText":"This is actually bigger than I expected but it's not huge. Looks nice on my countertop. It boils water really fast and the automatic shutoff is great. The water-level gauge/window is directly underneath the handle so you can't actually see it while you're filling the kettle up, which is stupid (sorry--it really is). And water gets trapped under there and the little window never dries out. I'm trying to ignore that but it's a little gross. It does get hot to the touch while it's on but not burn-your-hand hot.

It is rather useful, unobtrusive on the counter when not in use, and just a real handy item, and fast."},{"reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"kettle has lasted over a year","reviewDate":"July 12, 2019","reviewText":"This is the second of the same kettle I have bought. The first one was for my sister in law while she lived in the dorms- she used it for a year and then left it with us when she moved away, so I bought and shipped her a new one. The old one is still going strong.\nPros:\n1. It's not too loud- it quiets down after the first minute of heating if it's not full.\n2. It cleans up nicely with a quick wipe with a damp cloth. I probably should wash the inside more often but that's no problem to clean either.\n3.The little filter screen is still in good shape and if it get's lost there is still a metal strainer that is always there.\n4. The automatic shut off is timed well, I think. It comes to a full boil for no more than 5 seconds before it shuts off. And if you take it off the base it automatically flips the switch so when you put it back on it doesn't keep heating.\n5. It's a good size - not so big that you have to boil way more water than you would use for one cup of tea. But big enough for 5 small mugs (like the one pictured) or 4 bigger ones.\n\nCompare all of that to our last kettle of a different brand that broke. It was too loud, the screen fell apart (dissolved in the water?? I don't know, one day it just wasn't there but the frame was) and that made the automatic shut-off iffy. It would boil for 10-20 seconds before it shut off. Made me wonder if it might someday not shut off automatically. Not so with this one.\n\nWe use it to heat water for cooking (it's faster than our stove!), to fill the hot water bottle in the winter, to clean our drains, and of course for making tea!\n\nI do recommend this product! especially if you like to make 1-5 cups of tea at a time."},{"reviewerName":"Doug G","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"One Star","reviewDate":"December 22, 2017","reviewText":"Defective and dangerous.

I was so surprised to see that it leaks. At first I though I might not pour it right, until I see that water is actually come from one hole at the bottom. What a disappoint.

Around the beginning of December, the switch would have difficult staying turned on. The switch has a automatic turn off feature when it reaches boiling point. This is a really nice feature, so you can walk away and it will automatically stop. I don't know the mechanism involved, but it's not staying at all now. It went from a gradual difficulty to staying on to no longer staying on. Now, we have to actually hold the switch down to get water to a boil and even though this heats up pretty quickly, no one wants to hold the switch down manually for 2 or 3 minutes. I'm very disappointed this didn't last much longer, because overall, I think it did a pretty good job of heating in a short amount of time. I will probably not purchase this brand kettle again.\n\nPros:\n1. Quickly boils water, in a couple of minutes.\n2. Simple design.\n3. Relatively cheap.\n\nCons:\n1. Quality is questionable, as the switch is failing in less than 6 months of use.\n\nAlso, I saw someone mention in another review issues of rust. I didn't have any rust, but I make it a habit to never leave water in the kettle after use.

It was highly recommended by the leading consumer group. It does heat water for tea or other uses nearly twice quicker than the old stovetop kettle. If one carefully follow all the warnings and advisements in the included instruction book (copy available online) it should become a very efficient kitchen appliance. The price is very reasonable compared with competing devices which did not rate as well. We have had it for less than a month, but use it about twice a day. So far, it has been a delight. Probably would be a must have for college students and the like to heat water (following safe practices) for hot beverages, soup, noodles, etc. So much safer and more convenient than the old style immersion heaters of my college youth.

Also, it does not pollute water; I have stopped thinking about rust; I use it daily; every morning drink 2 glass of hot water or make green tea. Company should do something to make its base anti corrosive. I think rust is not a deal breaker for this product. In this price, even if it works for 2 years, I will be happy.

I'm thankful for the 15 months I got out of my $20 and I just bought another one for when I can finagle it no longer. What I really wished is that I had the 20 minutes back I wasted reading reviews about $20 pots to heat water.

I have another brand in my main kitchen that I've had for 12 years, was expensive, and I now know why. My second for a den off porch was a hamilton beach and it lasted about two years then got a bit rusty. This one is starting to show age already but I'm sure it's got a year or so left in it.

The reason I gave this one star was because the small clear lever you see right beneath the kettle handle broke in the first month of use. I'm the only one using the kettle and so it hasn't had a lot of wear and tear or misuse. This is essentially the only button on the unit and it is pushed down to start the kettle to boil. My kettle will still boil water if I hold the button down and am currently in the process of working with Hamilton Beach directly to process a warranty claim and they were cooperative in assisting with that.

Yes, I was prepared to have one shipped to Canada, which would have involved a hefty price tag, duties and surtaxes, in addition to purchasing a step-down converter. (But they are the most gorgeous kettles!) Today I happened to be walking through the Hudson's Bay and saw this kettle. I've never been particularly impressed by Hamilton Beach, but my eye happened to see an attached sticker that said \"FIVE YEAR WARRANTY - Longest Warranty Available.\" This is rare; everything these days is designed for obsolescence - our landfills are choking on shoddy crap and it should be illegal. Anyway, it looked cute and simple and exactly the right size for me; I'm the only tea drinker in the house so I don't require a giant kettle. One litre is plenty. I looked inside and it was all stainless steel except for a plastic filter that is easily removed. I also noticed that it doesn't have a gap between the walls of the kettle and the bottom; this is where crud and rust usually occur. I brought it home and fired it up. Normally I boil water on my gas stove and it takes so long I can practically have a nap. This kettle had my water at a roaring boil in under two minutes. And it continued to boil for a few more seconds before gasping out a big plume of steam. I like my tea piping hot, so this is important. I paid $32 Canadian for this kettle and I'm quite shocked, to be honest. Here's the weird thing...the manual reads that if the kettle was purchased in Canada, you get a 5 year warranty. Purchased in the US, the warranty is one year. This is baffling; rarely is it an advantage to be a Canadian shopper - usually we're choked that everything costs us twice as much. I thought I'd mention this...if you have a friend or family member in Canada, get them to buy you one so you can get the 5 year warranty. Anyway, I'm pleased as punch. :)"},{"reviewerName":"kat","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Kettle is a major safety hazard/ customer service is terrible.","reviewDate":"July 7, 2017","reviewText":"Wow, this company truly angered me. I didn't expect much from a $16 electric kettle, just to be able to fill it, turn it on, get hot water, and of course for it to last at least a year. I bought this December of 2016 and it is now July 2017 and it no longer turns on. In the last few weeks, we have had issues with the kettle auto shutting off, it just kept on boiling and the handle would get too hot to even touch. This is a major fire hazard considering it is made of plastic and connected to a wall outlet. In an effort to receive an apology and mainly to get store credit so I could purchase something else from Hamilton Beach (not one of their kettles), I contacted customer support to report the issue. Their reply was to, as a courtesy to me, ship me a new kettle and have me send them a picture of the cord cut rather than ship back my old kettle. The cost for this? $11.49. Also, their response to the major safety hazard?\n\n\"Kettles will often not turn off automatically upon boiling if the lid is not fully closed or the screen, from the spout, is missing. This is because steam needs to build up in the kettle for the switch to turn off. Always be sure the lid is closed completely and the filter is properly installed.\" -Jess W. Consumer Affairs.\n\nSo either I don't know how to shut a lid, or they have vital parts just dislodging themselves and apparently disappearing (because I probably would have noticed if a piece of the kettle had fallen off either INTO my water or outside the kettle.\n\nI've already purchased a new kettle, the Secura Original kettle, which has substantially better reviews, so I wasn't really expecting much from this customer service interaction, but boy did this response piss me off.\n\nAfter I responded recommending they revise their response to me, Jessica replied back that as a courtesy to me they will only charge me $6.99 because \"Shipping and handling is not covered under the limited warranty, as stated in your use and care guide.\" Are major product defects also described in the use and care guide Jessica?!"},{"reviewerName":"ElenaOH","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Nice pot; water only, please","reviewDate":"March 22, 2018","reviewText":"Our daughter purchased the Hamilton Beach 1 L Stainless Steel Electric Kettle from amazon for us a few months before we picked up a Bonavita pot. The Hamilton Beach has a ‘classier’ design, and holds about 4 ½ c water. However, the tube-like heating element is permanently fixed inside the pot itself; it is impossible to clean around he element if anything besides water is heated. Further, the attached lid makes reaching inside to clean nearly impossible. Heats very quickly. Base is separate from the pot, which is more esthetically pleasing, but having two pieces can be a little more cumbersome than the ‘single piece’ design of the Bonavita. As with the Bonavita, if you have hard water, minerals can build up inside the pot, which can make for a noisy pot. If this is an issue in your home, swish a tablespoon of vinegar inside, wipe out, and rinse. (This is a bit more difficult to do than with the Bonavita due to the heating element being inside the kettle itself rather than in the base.). If you want greater capacity than the Bonavita offers, a ‘classy’ design, and will use it only to heat water, this pot is a good choice.\n\nBonavita 0.5L Mini Electric Stainless Steel Kettle: purchased this about two months ago; very pleased. It holds about 2 ½ c., water for tea, but can also be used to cook noodles, soup, even hard-boiled eggs! Very easy to wash out—lid is removable and there is no element inside the pot, similar to a non-electric tea kettle. Takes less than 2 minutes to heat at max. capacity. No removable base—all one unit. Not a fancy design, but a workhorse kettle. (If you have hard water, after several uses minerals can build up inside ANY pot, which can make for a noisy pot. If this is an issue in your home, swish a tablespoon of vinegar inside, wipe out, and rinse.). If you’re traveling, a college student, at work—or even at home!—and need to heat just enough water for two cups of tea, or even cook a simple lunch for one person, this pot is a fine choice."},{"reviewerName":"John","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great small kettle for the price.","reviewDate":"January 2, 2017","reviewText":"Works exactly as I hoped it would. It is made to ONLY heat water. The complaints about being able to wash it out are somewhat unwarranted. If you only boil water (not tea, not soup) the only thing that will accumulate over time is scale which you can boil out with some cream of tartar. Nothing biological can survive the boiling water and steam it will be exposed to.\n\nIn my experience, It will boil 1 liter of water from room temperature in about 4.5 minutes. I like the fact that it doesn't have a cord attached when I lift the kettle more than I thought I would. The water does come into direct contact some plastic, the scale filter in the spout which you can remove and the water level gauge which you cannot remove. The underside of the lid is made of plastic and steam will accumulate/condense on it then fall back into the water, but it appears to be high temperature plastic. I am not worried about leaching with this limited exposure.\n\nWhen you use this kettle, don't leave water in it to cool down. Only heat what you need each time and pour any excess out while it is still hot to help reduce scale buildup."},{"reviewerName":"JSBNews","rating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"I got a leaker but it does heat the water boiling hot","reviewDate":"March 8, 2018","reviewText":"Sadly, like others have experienced, this kettle has developed a leak. Mine is not as disastrous as others have written, but it is a slow drip-drip-drip. It looks like it is coming from one of the little knobby buttons that are supposed to be feet.\n\nOtherwise, this is a nice little hot water kettle for the price although it is not pleasant to use. I don't expect music or aromatherapy or Bluetooth connectivity when I'm heating water, but there are things that could be improved by this simple kettle. First, the opening is rather small, so getting water in and seeing the water level is hard to do at the same time. Yes, there is a plastic level monitor on the side, but unless the light level in the room is bright you cannot see the water level. Consequently, it is easy to overfill this (of course it is very easy to pour out the overage through the well-designed spout, which is the only good feature of the product). I'm not a fan of the on-off switch being below the handle or the plastic/stainless steel lid. Also, I would advise not actually touching the stainless steel sides after the water is hot (that might be common sense, but I've had electric kettles in the past that do not get hot on the exterior, go figure).\n\nThe unit is quite noisy once the water starts boiling, and I suspect that is due to the smaller size of the product and thin stainless steel. I will say the handle is very comfortable, but someone with larger hands might have problems with comfort. All that said, however, the water comes out boiling hot, which is really all we want for an electric kettle.\n\nThe bottom line is, if you need a cheap hot water kettle that provides up to 1 liter of boiling water, then this might fit the bill, but hopefully, you don't get a leaker or a gusher."},{"reviewerName":"Mihir S","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"We should have bought this a long time back.

Wanted another Hot Pot but couldn't find one here locally (and I had an immediate need). So looking around at what was available I choose this model. My coffee maker is a Hamilton Beach and I'm happy with it, so I figured I would be happy an electric kettle by them too. I do like that this stainless steel model does match most of the stuff in my kitchen. The kettle is easy to operate, and heats water to boiling fairly quickly. I like that there is a base that plugs in and you can remove the kettle from the base after heating the water. The only thing I might ding this unit on, is the owners manual says the unit turns off when the water has reached boiling. I haven't seen mine do that yet - but I might not be letting the water boil long enough to do that. I usually turn it off manually as soon as I hear the water boiling.
