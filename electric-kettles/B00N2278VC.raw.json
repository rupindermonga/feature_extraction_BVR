The controller will require 2 AA batteries which is not provided. Drone body is about 2 inches side to side and about 1 inch tall without the prop guards and landing gear installed. Everything is fairly easy to put together. Accessories pop into little notches on the frame. Drone battery takes a little effort to get into the frame if you have large fingers but it's manageable.\n\nDrone batteries took about 40 minutes to charge. Once charged up, I got about 10 minutes of flight time per battery. If you've ever flown any toy drones before, you will be able to fly this really easily. If not, no big deal. The little drone is so light weight that if you crash it, it'll probably not take much damage.\n\nThe controller has a place to store the drone and accessories. Also fits well in the hands and easy to operate. Button on the top left of controller controls how fast the drone can fly. Button on top right is for doing flips. All four trim controls are underneath the right control stick and the take-off/land buttons are underneath the left controls stick.\n\nOverall, I like this little drone. Fun toy to play around with in the house and will likely give it to my little nephew before letting him touch my DJI drone."},{"reviewerName":"Kelly","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of this drone.","reviewDate":"August 1, 2019","reviewText":"¬†Got this drone for my 7 year old boy.\n\nAfter much research I decided on this one because of its size, features and simplicity for kids.\nIt came nicely packaged and set up was simple.\nIt does require a little calibration to get it to hover in one place, but that is to be expected.He was delighted with it and was soon flying it around the house like a pro.\n\nHe really loves it!

The one touch take off and landing makes it really easy for him to get it in the air. He likes the new take-off way that called \"throw to go\", just throw the drone into the air with your wrist power and the drone will take off automatically. Headless mode is also great and removes confusion over which way to move the steering stick depending on the orientation of the drone. With a little practice he was able to confidently fly it in and around the house.\nSome tips: Be safety, accompany your young children to playing the drone and give them right guidance. Outside is obviously more fun, but the mini drone does get easily carried by the wind so be careful and make sure you have plenty of space."},{"reviewerName":"Emma","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Awesomeness incarnate. The SNAPTAIN mini drone for kids!","reviewDate":"July 14, 2019","reviewText":"¬†My child is into drones now so I invested in one more drone and so far this is my favourite! This SNAPTAIN SP310 mini drone is a inexpensive toy, and a wonderful gift for kids. With beautiful simple appearance and easy to control, and the instruction is easy to understand. I would not really recommend this for outdoor flying in anything but the lightest of breezes or calm days, or you can adjust to the third speed for better control. Well, it depends you, lol. My 7 year old is mastering the flight of the drone which is a testament to the ease of use after getting accustomed to the controls. This RC quadcopter is very stable and is ideal for indoor flying particularly with the integral, prop guards. These prove very effective at protecting the props and you are unlikely to need the spare ones that they provide. Despite the abuse it still flying fine and nothing broken off. It comes with 2 batteries means it is easier to recharge one while using the other, and longer flying time. Kids love it and have so much fun. It is small, so perfect for little ones. A lot of stunts make kids happy, throw'n go is the most special and is our favourite. 3D flip also makes it much more fun. Uh... i have taken a short video at my frontdoor and want to show you guys something about this SNAPTAIN SP310 mini 4-axis drone, hope you will like it as i do. That's all, a definitely wonderful mini drone for kids! Just get one and catch happy."},{"reviewerName":"Customer","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"This is a tiny drone","reviewDate":"August 16, 2019","reviewText":"¬†Bought DJI mavic and kid want to try it... you know that is too expensive to crash, then I bought this tiny one.\nVideo is the ‚Äú3D flip‚Äù which is pretty cool."},{"reviewerName":"J","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great mini drone for kids and beginners. Love this beautiful and fun little gadget so much!","reviewDate":"July 24, 2019","reviewText":"I have been wanting one drone for months and finally got one. It's so much more fun than I thought. I have been playing this SNAPTAIN SP310 mini drone with my 10 years old little boy, he loves it and controls it really well after playing with it several times.\n\nThis mini drone looks quite small but exquisite, and comes with a controller box in simple design, easy to operate and also very responsive. It took us few goes to learn to fly this, as it says that designed for kids and beginners.\n\nWhat surprised me most is throw to fly. I just need throw the little drone up into the air that it will automatic fly and hovering at a fixed height, but i tried several times to find the proper strength to throw it. Of course you need to pair and calibrate the drone with your remote before you throw it. I would recommend you guys to horizontal put the drone on your hand and then throw the drone vertical upward gently at begins until that you are familiar with it.\n\nYou can also use the supplied remote box to control the drone. This drone is more suitable for kids and beginners which has the one-key that beginners need, one key take off and one key landing. Or you can take off by using the joystick as well. It's your choice, lol.\n\nThe battery is very easy to slip in and out and charge, you simply plug in the supplied micro-USB cable. SNAPTAIN supplies 2 batteries to extend the flying tour time. It took me about 32minutes to full recharge the battery. I have not confirmed the longest flying time yet, but I will.\n\nBy the way, I would recommend to try indoor for first fly, especially not great to fly this mini drone in a windy weather, I put this down to it being so tiny, but it's amazing when the weather it's good, controls are easy. My little boy has used it indoor so far and can control it very well, so did I. Quality is good as I crashed it few times and no damage was done. It‚Äôs worth ago.\n\nI will suggest you to read the instruction clearly before you first flying. A detailed instruction manual is included, but I found the best way to learn is by doing. There are still many skills that require me to practice more, such as 3D flips, headless mode, on key return and so on.\n\nSo to sum up, a really good mini drone to start you off in this fascinating hobby."},{"reviewerName":"Hass A.","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Love this little beast! Nice drone with awesome features!","reviewDate":"July 8, 2019","reviewText":"It arrives packaged well in a small box containing a mini drone in a remote controller box, two rechargeable batteries, USB charger, instruction, spare set of accessories. With two rechargeable batteries that you can enjoy a longer flight tour!\nSome may say that the drone is super light, but all drones are light to save power consumption and weight giving you more flight time. The build quality is excellent and although I've had a few accidents bumping and crashing its not fallen to bits which is a testament to the build quality. It can bring a lot of fun not only to children but also some adults, maybe it is difficult to operate at the beginning, but if you read the instruction carefully and practise more, it will be easy to control then. Since the drone is kept in the controller box, it is convenient to take everywhere. It took me about 15-20 minutes to master the controls and having this little guy zipping around the room, performing flips, zipping it through doorways and harassing the dog(be safe, don't hurt pets or people). I tried tens of drones and most of them can be put into the bin. But this little thing for this ridiculous price is really good. Of course it is not a comparison to a professional drone, but it brings me much great fun!"},{"reviewerName":"Jackie Peng","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Brilliant little RC quadcopter. A great kid for my son! He absolutely loves it!","reviewDate":"July 5, 2019","reviewText":"¬†Before I gave it to him, I had to test it (of course). To my surprise, it flew very well and now I'm thinking of ordering one for myself!!\n\nThe drone is essentially quite stable and responds well to the controller. Headless mode is also available and I think this is what makes it so easy to fly, no worries about direction, just push the stick the way you want the drone to go. There is a LED indicator the front which is quite bright make for easy orientation.\n\nThe SP310 mini drone has three speed rates. I started at the low speed, and once I had got the hang of balancing the throttle at the same time as changing direction I moved in to the higher rate mode, where it really comes in to its own. If you need it to, it will literally whip round on the spot and really pick up some impressive speed.\n\nWe have used it outside to learn more skills and it goes really well. It does take time to learn to fly but as I say it really is good fun for me and my children to have some time flying. My boy loves the 3D flip most, it just needs one button pressed and assign a direction with the joystick to complete the show. The performance is stable and smooth, better than the drone I bought for myself last month, much better!\n\nOnce the battery is low, the LED indicator will slowly flash giving you sufficient warning to bring the quadcopter back down again. The two rechargeable batteries could extend the flight, but you would be advised to buy a couple of spare batteries as the charging time for each battery will feel like an eternity when you are waiting to fly.\n\nThis drone is perfect for those who just want to play, which is exactly what we required. Great for kids and great value for the money. Got a kid interested in flight or RC? GET THIS!"},{"reviewerName":"Tom Choi","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great drone for kids.","reviewDate":"July 24, 2019","reviewText":"I had been looking for a suitable indoor drone for my 6 year old son until meet SNAPTAIN sp310.Really good build quality.Diverse Way to take off,that makes the start more funny.It flies smoothly but will take some practice if this is you first drone.This mini drone has a great flight time with two batteries,and most importantly charging quickly.the remote control is nice and responsive.

This time, a compact drone, SNAPTAIN SP310 mini drone has caught my eye.\nThe little drone surprised me with the \"throw'n go\". I think it is interesting to toss this mini drone into the air to start a flight. Another thing that made me happy is the controller box. My previous drones had bulky controllers which were nice, but this looks and feels so much better. Additionally, the portable controller box provides much better portability. I can almost fit it in my looser trousers pocket. Overall, the remote feels pleasant to hold and responds well to action which in my opinion is most important about a controller.\nThis drone is easy to use and set up. It is recommended for kids and beginners, but I think everyone would be able to start using it quickly. The battery lasts rather long, exactly as long as described by the seller in this matter, which is quite impressive for a drone of this size. Overall, I think it is a very nice drone for a decent price and I am happy with my purchase."},{"reviewerName":"KEVLAR","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"A great INDOOR drone. You CAN switch/ use multiple batteries!!","reviewDate":"September 19, 2019","reviewText":"TLDR: You can switch out multiple batteries to extend flight time in between charging times. Comes with 2 batteries and a charger that charges both simultaneously, an accessories kit, and screwdriver.\n\nWhen I decide to write reviews, I try to focus them on issues or concerns a may have had personally. When I viewed (And read other reviews about) this drone, I didn‚Äôt see anything about using batteries - other than that the battery life was great! Well, that‚Äôs all well and good, but I don‚Äôt want to HAVE to wait 40 minutes for an internal (Non-switchable) battery to charge in between EVERY 12-15 minutes of use. I want a drone where I can buy 4-5 batteries, charge them all, then switch one out after another as they are discharged. This way, I can get closer to 60 minutes of flight time when I go out to fly the drone. This IS that kind of drone!! Don‚Äôt get me wrong - You still need to use certain batteries in this drone (Connectors, voltage), but at least using multiple batteries is an option.\nSo... Is this drone as great as they say, or does the company harass and bribe you into leaving a positive review (Like others I‚Äôve dealt with!)? Absolutely not!! Do they want you to leave an honest review? Absolutely - After all, that‚Äôs how sellers promote the credibility of their products! Nowhere in the ‚ÄúExtra‚Äù literature does it ask you to leave a ‚ÄúPositive‚Äù review. It merely asks to ‚ÄúShare your experience by leaving an honest review‚Äù (Verbatim).\nIs this drone going to be everything to all people? Unlikely. After all, that‚Äôs simply an impossibility! Does it do what it claims to do, when you want it to do it? Yes!! This is NOT an ‚ÄúOutdoor‚Äù drone! No drone this size is. They‚Äôre simply too light! They will drift in ANY wind.\nHowever... If you‚Äôre new to the hobby, and want a reliable drone that has switchable batteries (GREAT flight times in between charges), is highly mobile, has some easy to implement tricks, and is backed by a company that realizes the impact of a happy consumer, this drone will definitely fit the bill. The remote control even has a space on the underside where you can store some extra props and an extra battery!\nI own several drones, ranging in price from $20.00 to over $3,000.00 and I‚Äôve found this to be a lot of fun indoors and very useful to help raise my kids‚Äô experience with drones without concern over cost or damage potential."},{"reviewerName":"wei chen","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great compact and lightweight mini drone!","reviewDate":"August 6, 2019","reviewText":"I got this for my nephew as a starter drone. Picking up the drone for the first time it is amazing how small it is. It comes with two batteries, controller box, USB charging cable, propeller protector, additional propellers and user manual. The controller box is nice and sleek. After charging the battery, setting up to fly is simple. Turn drone on first, then the controller box. It is an easy to fly drone with good altitude hold and responds to changes. There is a button to choose three modes on the remote: slow, medium and fast. Fly indoors in slow mode and fast in open outdoor spaces. Flight time is around 10-15 minutes depending how aggressively you fly it. It actually flies very fast once you get a bit of practice.

I did have a mini RC helicopter before. The 3D Flips function of this 4-axis flyer definitely makes it more fun to play with compared to traditional RC helicopter. It comes with all the accessories you need like extra Li-ion battery, screw driver, spare rotor blades, spare protective blade guards and spare landing skids. All of these accessories can actually fit in the back compartments of the controller. The drone itself can fit in the controller as well (but need to remove the protective blade guards and landing skids). One thing worth noting is that it is a bit difficult to get the Li-ion battery in/out the drone because the battery and the drone are both so tiny. Prepare a pair of tweezers with you may save you a lot of time taking the battery out or putting it in. Just like any other RC helicopters, a little bit practice is required if you want to play it in a tiny confined area without collision. You can first play it outdoor to avoid crashing it into your wall. Once you learn how to play it is a lot of fun, not difficult to master it at all for beginners like me."},{"reviewerName":"Denno Jaramillo","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Love this drone!!","reviewDate":"October 8, 2019","reviewText":"Blades are constantly flying off, as well as the blade guards and even the landing gear.

Amazing game for kids.","reviewDate":"July 8, 2019","reviewText":"This is a cheap, tiny drone that is great fun. I brought it for my nephew and he loved it. Stability in the air is good and responds quickly to the controller.\nWhilst the controls does takes some time getting use to, once you are familiar, you can easily control the drone and how it flies. My nephew found bit difficult to operate at the first time, but he can handle this mini drone much better after few practice. The remote is also very sensitive and smooth. I am most impressed it's a key feature - It's easily take off by throwing with hands. Really easy to operate. It's made with good quality materials as if it's falling it won't damage it's blades. Comes with 2 batteries for the drone so whilst one is in-flight the other can be on charge. Two 1.5V AA batteries are required for the hand-held remote so make sure you have some handy else you will have to pause the pilot mode until you get some.\nKids flew it everywhere fast into walls and ceiling. This mini drone can take a lot of crashes. The sensitivity is amazing, not a single bump into a wall or furniture. What's more, this drone has LED lights which makes it wonderful to play outside in the garden when it is dark. Make sure that there are no pets around when you play as they may chasing for it and get hurt. Super cool, I hope it will last as it is so great.

The Drone is surprisingly very easy to control within something as small as a recreational vehicle. Outdoors the Drone also move quite fast and can really withstand some serious abuse. The majority of my Landings were crash landing at full speed into a wall and never did any of the plastic cases break. There are extra propellers and landing gear and blade protectors that fit in a little compartment on the bottom that is absolutely an amazing idea. There is a center compartment that will fit the USB battery charger and two batteries. This allows everything you need to fit within the remote controller case, including all of the parts necessary to fix it after a crash. The trim controls work well as I found it necessary to adjust the trim controls after pretty much every crash or whenever the battery was replaced however wants to trim controls are properly set the Drone does pretty much hover in space without any movement. I would suggest that you keep this away from people and pets as if you crash into them the spinning blades tend to sting but I highly doubt they would ever cause a cut.
