Fits enough water for serving many cups of tea/coffee at once, heats up fast and is pretty easy to clean. Nothing too special, but works great! I think the price is very reasonable and I definitely am happy with this purchase. Packaging comes with a little booklet with using/cleaning tips. One tip was very useful: boil the kettle with some loose tea leaves to get rid of new kettle smell. I tried it, and it worked great!I would absolutely recommend this to a friend, and I would absolutely purchase again if needed."},{"reviewerName":"Reginald Smith","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Best electric heater ever","reviewDate":"October 27, 2019","reviewText":"Amazing water heater.

I‚Äôve had it a few weeks now and I love the temperature control. My only complaints are that I wish the lid would open wider to make it easier to fill at the faucet, and I also wish the handle was less wide and more rounded. The thickness and squared edges of the handle make it difficult and uncomfortable to hold when it‚Äôs full of water. But you don‚Äôt hold it for very long when it‚Äôs full anyway, so no huge deal."},{"reviewerName":"EclecticKnitter","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Seems to be good, although I had to get the first one replaced","reviewDate":"October 10, 2019","reviewText":"My old electric kettle died after a good seven years of daily and frequent use, so I ordered this one as it was similar to the old one. I received the kettle in one day as a Prime member but the thing did not work at all. The dead one was replaced and I had it the next day. This time it worked. It's slightly larger than my old one and the inside part of the lid is fully stainless rather than plastic. Improvement, definitely. This unit is a bit louder than my old one (by Chrystaline, no longer available) but it also seems to heat water more quickly. So far so good. Since the first one was DOA, though, I'm holding my breath on this one. There is leaflet in the box to extend the warranty. Not sure if that is free or not, but I will check into it. For the price, if it lasts a couple years, I'll be happy. I would give this 5 stars if I had more confidence in how long it will last."},{"reviewerName":"M","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Works great!","reviewDate":"October 16, 2019","reviewText":"I have used it only once and it works beautifully. Heats a whole kettle of water in about 3 minutes. I love the wide mouth as it can be cleaned easily. Great value for money as well.

Half the price of the one I bought before. (I still have them both, in different locations.) Less plastic, fantastic - stainless steel on the inside where it touches the water, as promised. The only drawback is the cord. It has a 3-pronged cord that is way too short, so I couldn't plug it into the most convenient spots. I hate the new sort \"safety\" cords because I have an old house, with inconvenient outlets. But I comparison shopped, and this was the best one."},{"reviewerName":"SS","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"easy to use","reviewDate":"September 23, 2019","reviewText":"I move my office, I need a electric water heater upgraded, this is the perfect one for me!!!"},{"reviewerName":"oncidium Littlejohn","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Good Electric Kettle","reviewDate":"November 9, 2019","reviewText":"This hot pot holds about 1.7 liters (0.45 gallon) of water and has a slick oval appearance on top. It is large enough for any household purposes. Although it does not have a viewing window to see the water level inside the pot, I do not find it being inconvenient at all. The top cover does not have a spring and must be pulled open to pour water in. It must be closed and shut securely by pressing it to prevent hot water from splashing out while dispensing the boiling water. At 1000 watts, the heating speed is reasonable and comparable to others that I have used. It comes with an attached heavy gauge wire so that the wire and plug will never overheat"},{"reviewerName":"Maggie wu","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Worth money","reviewDate":"October 6, 2019","reviewText":"I love my new tea pot, no more waiting for the old one to boil the water,it's so quick to boil water.i have been looking for a kettle for a while,this is very helpful to me.

This saves me so much time in the morning as it boils water really fast. It is very easy to clean and use and I find this really convenient. Finally... no more pot and stove!
