The Intertek label on the power base shows \"900-1100W\" and \"Conforms to UL STD 1082\" which is the correct UL specification for this type of household device., The kettle glass appears flawless and of uniform thickness with 0.5L (MIN), 1.0L and 1.7L (MAX) markings on two opposite sides, the plastic parts are of smooth and flat/satin finishes with no mold separation flash, and the base containing the heating element and LED has an outer plastic cover with the same Intertek label. The LED lamp(s?) in the kettle base reflect off a prismed o-ring lens that appears to be part of the glass flask bottom. The handle has an upper push switch which opens the spring-loaded cover, and a lower rocker switch with \"I\" and \"O\" positions for power. Electrical power is made with a circular female connector in the center of the kettle base which seats on a male connector centered on the power base., I followed the instructions and twice operated the kettle with a full (MAX) 1.7L fill up. Using cool tap water measured at 68F, the kettle took exactly 9.0 minutes to reach a rolling boil measured at 211-212F using both an infrared non-contact thermometer and a probe type immersion thermometer. The kettle automatically shuts off after about 20 seconds at full boil and a small screen attachment on the lid behind the pour spout prevents splashing of water outside of the kettle during boiling and also acts as a baffle to prevent flow surges while pouring. Removing the kettle from the base is a simple lift-up motion off the power base and the power base does not conduct any significant heat., Overall I have no negative comments, find this appliance very easy to use, and am confident in safety features."}, {"reviewerName": "KEHBeth", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "reviewTitle": "Okay, the blue light is pretty cool...", "reviewDate": "February 9, 2019", "reviewText": "\"I never needed a kettle until I got sick and all I could think of was some hot tea.
