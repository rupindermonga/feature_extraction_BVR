We fill the carafe with the desired liquid volume,  place the glass carafe onto the heating unit, and activate the Start switch to begin the short heating process.  Most of our liquid heating requests are for the maximum volume -- 1.7L.  The heating time from the Start request to full boil is less than five minutes.  I have measured the water temperature at full boil with an infrared heat measuring instrument.  The recorded temperature has been 212 degrees Fahrenheit - consistently.  The blue LED light does illuminate when electrical power is being employed to function the unit.  The blue LED light shuts off when the heating function ceases., \" Cleaning procedures are clearly described in the enclosed owners manual/instructions.  We use a clean cloth to wipe down the exterior of the unit as well as the interior of the carafe.  I have found the carafes opening quite large enough to easily perform any wipe-down of the carafes interior walls or stainless steel bottom.  To that end, its a considerate design element that the lid-affixed liquid strainer has some flexibility so that any inadvertent bump to the strainer while cleaning the carafes interior, will help prevent any permanent damage to the strainer or lid.\",  Pouring boiling liquid from the carafe into a cup or other receptacle has been easy and safe. Neither one of us have found the weight of a full carafe to be an issue.,  The electrical heating plate, on which the glass carafe rests, does accept a few wraps (on the underside of the electrical plate) of the electrical cord should cord length be a concern.  It has not been so for us.,  Yes.  We have caused the glass carafe to lightly \"clunk\" against the sink faucet, sink, counter top.  No scratching or fractures have occurred to the glass.,  De-scaling cleaning process/instructions  -  we have amended only the following:  Two cups of distilled vinegar to one cup of water.,  Based on our seven weeks of use and communication with Cosori representatives, we would recommend this Amazon seller for honesty and integrity and this unit for dependable function."}, {"reviewerName": "Linda Vinecour", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "reviewTitle": "THERE IS PLASTIC!!!!!!!", "reviewDate": "December 15, 2018", "reviewText": "\"Folks, if youre looking for a plastic free kettle this lovely looking item is NOT the one for you.

I hope this isnt an indicator of a short life span ahead.\", Now the good stuff:, \"1) Its very attractive. A main reason that Im replacing my good old kettle is because, although it still works well, it is beginning to look very shabby. The Cosori really adds class to my coffee prep area.

I opened immediately to clean and test it., Packaging:, Packaging was no frills (I consider that a bonus). Two pieces of styrofoam (top and bottom) with a manual, thank you card with warranty information, and some plastic bags containing the key items (Base and Pot). The packaging was stout and more than sufficient considering I heard my mailman literally throw the amazon box at my door from around 5-6 feet away. Nothing was broken or even looked jostled., Cleaning:, \"I do not have small hands, so I was concerned about being able to reach within the pot for proper cleaning. This was quickly dashed as I was able to reach inside very easily. There are very few nooks and crannies that can harbor anything bad as well. The cleaning process was quick and painless and the pot dried easily. My only complaint is being unable to leave it upside-down to drain any excess liquid out (the lid doesnt move out of the way). This is a minor complaint and a personal preference, so I did not remove any stars for this.\", Use:, \"Once dried, I filled the pot to just a bit above the max line (wasnt paying attention). I do not recommend going any bit past that line if at all possible, as when the water came to a boil it was nearly reaching the spout. Nothing spilled out, but if you ignore the lines you will have a mess on your hands. I placed the pot, once filled, on the stand and watched it boil up, which took around 7 minutes or so. During that I touched multiple surfaces to see the heat distribution, as I want to place this somewhere slightly more delicate than my kitchen counters.\", \"The base of the pot was just the tiniest bit warm. Not by any means a danger to any surface, and I was rather impressed by how little heat it actually held. The metal surfaces at the top and bottom were both warm to the touch, but far removed from burning skin, and probably somewhat comfortable on a cool or cold day. The glass was hot to the touch and will burn you, as expected. This is not a product to leave where children can reach it or pull it down, as itll cause burns and possibly cuts if the glass breaks. But I feel confident on placing it on any surface within my house and it wont cause any damage.\", Pros:, \"Relatively quick to boil. Quite easy to clean. Nice blue LED to tell when its on and when boil is reached itll auto-shut off within around 30 seconds (my timing). Was able to move the pot freely around on the stand and it worked no matter the direction.\", Cons:, \"No water temperature control. This was my only complaint, as I dont like tea as hot as most do (especially compared to my European friends). It provides a nice heat and is an appropriate temperature for me, but being able to adjust this would be nice. This was my one star removal.\", Notes:, This is my first electric pot, so I do not know if other pots have temperature controls. If not, what are they waiting for? (safety concerns maybe?), I rated this at 4 stars due to being a new owner and not knowing its lasting legacy as of yet, and the temperature control.

Pours well and safely (does not spill anything even if you over-pour by accident)., Cons:, - for me personally, it is NOT easy to clean, and it\\s very easy to break when cleaning it.  The white \"scale\" starts to build up at the bottom after only a few boils, forcing me to clean it with vinegar.  When cleaning, the top cannot be removed, and it opens up at a 45 degree angle, so you just have to awkwardly maneuver it in the sink when cleaning it, and at the same time avoid breaking the glass.  It\\s really big, so this isn\\t easy to do. If you\\re AT ALL clumsy or have bad luck with breaking glass, PLEASE think twice about buying this.  It\\s a very nice kettle, but one mishap and it\\s gone., \"- its REALLY LOUD.  Part of the reason I bought this was to avoid using a noisy microwave and fumbling around in the kitchen very early in the morning as not to wake anyone up.

Really no complaints, but if I were to pick a couple nits, I would say that, (1) the minimum amount of water it requires you to heat is a little more than I generally need to heat (2) the button to raise the lid and the lid hinge are a little stiff, but feel sturdy and may loosen up with a little use (3) it has a mesh filter across the spout that I dont really need - not sure if it is a safety thing for preventing splashes or overly fast pours, but it doesnt add much to (or take much away from) my quality of life.

I can mange dumping out the extra water and I lay the pot sideways in the drying rack.  This allows the interior of the pot to air-dry without water sitting on the inner metal base.

I use it many times a day for brewing tea. I add tea leaves to the pot after water boils, let it steep for a few minutes and its ready to go. Sometimes I toss in pieces of ginger as well for flavor. It works beautifully and the LED looks stunning. The British Strix Control was a big draw for me for this product. Contrary to other reviewers, there was no plastic smell at all. There is mostly no plastic that comes into contact with any heat, so Im not sure why it would smell. So on to the negatives. The first minor annoyance I have is that there is a strainer (plastic rim) that is attached to the lid, which is supposed to hold back the tea leaves when pouring. The problem is that there is a fairly large gap on the sides of the strainer, which the tea leaves manage to wriggle out of. So I have to use an external strainer anyway, making the integrated strainer rather pointless. And to top it, the strainer has plastic. Why Why Why? Why have a plastic rim and not steel? I dont care if the plastic is rated safe or if babies bottles are designed with it, I just dont want it to come into contact with the liquid, especially when it doesnt even do the job its supposed to do. I wish I could just remove it. The second annoyance is that it is rather hard to clean the kettle because of its shape.

It functioned very well for all four years.  We decided on the Cosori because of its great reviews, beauty, BPA-free quality.  We have had it for several weeks now, and have been happy.  The Cosori is quieter, heats water faster, and the glass carafe is definitely more sophisticated-looking that our old unit.  There is piece of mind knowing that the water is BPA-free., I did not give this kettle five stars because of the delay in which the unit shuts off after the water reaches the boiling point.  I have owned a Brand X, a T-Fal, a Capresso, and an Epica prior to this kettle, and all of them shut off much earlier than the Cosori.  When filled to 1L mark, the Cosori took 27 seconds to shut off from a full rolling boil.  When filled to the 1.7L mark, it took 45 seconds to shut off from a full rolling boil.  Tremendous amounts of steam comes out of the pot during this time, enough to do damage to your kitchen cabinets, steam off wallpaper or damage flat paint on a wall if nearby., \"I thought something might be wrong with my kettle, so I contacted Cosori by email.  To their credit, they answered my question within 24 hours.  However, they indicated that there is nothing wrong with my kettle; the shut off delay is there to make sure all the water is heated to boiling.  I would not leave this kettle unattended while preparing food; if you arent going to be around when the kettle is going to reach boiling, make sure it is pointed away from any surface and definitely keep young children away from its spout.

Because the entire top of the Cosori opens--with no rim--it has worked perfectly for filling. I suspect that I may smack the raw glass top and break it at some point, but the filling process is far better than with the Nesco design.
