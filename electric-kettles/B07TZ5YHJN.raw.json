Transitioning from an older pot thats two prong is a bit of a shock.  My kitchen counter plugs are still two prong, this was an immediate issue.  I had to buy and cheap adapter in order to make it work.  Also, the connecting wire is so stiff that the base will not sit properly on my counter.  Also, the wire stiffness forces the plug with adapter downwards, with possibility of unplugging.  It has not happened yet but I can see it happening soon.  Un-boxing the product was a head-scratcher.  There was this sand-like residue inside the plastic holding the product.  It was not much but there was enough causing some rubbing on the black finish of the pot making it look like its been sand-papered.  Was this a return item from some sandy beach customer?  Anyway, I wiped it clean and rinsed the pot to ensure, I dont get sand in my tea.  The rubbing is not so visible but I know its there.  As for the pot, its heavy.  Yes, its made of glass so compared to my original plastic pot, I expected the heft but not so much thats truly noticeable.  I guess part of it is, the handle is so fat that with smaller hands, plus the heft, its certainly gives the appearance of heaviness too.  It has a cool blue light indicating that its operating properly.  Yes, it boils water fast with auto shut off.  The top opening cover can be pulled back a tad bit to allow for easy filling.  Pouring using the spout is precise without splashing.  I suppose you can open the cover for a quick pour when filling a stewing or pasta pot.  Returning the pot on the base is also not precise.  I find myself hunting for the centering connector in order to sit the pot properly.  Part of the problem I believe is the base is so light and flimsy compared to the pot, the whole setup feels unstable.  Its like giving a Humvee bicycle tires instead of fat, sure-footed stout tires.  The current footing for the base is plastic instead of rubber.
