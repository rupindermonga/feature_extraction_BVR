I have searched high and low, reading way too many reviews of way too many different electric water kettles. Let me summarize for you: generally the great divide in people's preferences are: 1. those who want fast heating; 2. those who want to see how much water is in the kettle; 3. those who want zero plastic touching water. If you want #1 and 3, this is the kettle for you. I'm not sure why #2 is that important, but if it irks you to not know exactly how much water is being heated, this kettle is not for you.\n\nIn spring 2018, the American Academy of Pediatrics released a recommendation to minimize plastic use for children's food containers (baby bottle, plates, bowls), based on a study that showed that in high heat conditions such as dish washer and microwave, even BPA free plastic will release chemicals into its contents. Don't wait for scientists to prove that it's bad to use plastics when heating up things. Most of the kettles out there have some plastic component touching the water, be it the window that tell you how much water is inside, the lid, or even the filter at the spout. This is one of very few that I found to be plastic free in all parts that come in contact with the water you are drinking.\n\nI likes this kettle, because it looks nice, and does a fine job heating up water, does so quickly and safety with its automatic shut off feature. So go ahead and buy this, you'll like it. Except if you just can't stand having heated slightly too much or too little water. Or you know, you could use a measuring cup to put in the exact amount of water you want. There, problem solved, and this is still the perfect kettle."},{"reviewerName":"Maiden of Laurus","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Good, quiet, quick electric kettle","reviewDate":"April 14, 2019","reviewText":"I was excited when this finally arrived. I've been a stove top water boiler for a while but my tea kettle was becoming warped and noisy, so I thought I'd try an electric kettle.\n\nI read the instructions; which were pretty standard: Don't burn yourself and electricity plus water is bad.\n\nI gave it the recommended cleaning and filled the kettle a little below max fill. Then I put it on the base, plugged it in and flipped the switch.\n\nIt was so much quieter than I was expecting and boiled the water in just a few minutes. The outside was safe to touch as well.\n\nI'm really happy and think its great for the money."},{"reviewerName":"Steven","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great kettle! Works well for tea","reviewDate":"April 19, 2019","reviewText":" Excellent product. I brought it to use in my home for assorted instant things (Tea, coffee, oatmeal) that I enjoy. And BPA free is the main reason I selected this model.\n\nSo far I love this kettle, with important features being the stainless steel construction, the shiny black exterior appearance, the high quality of manufacture, and the value for money it represents. With a 1.5kW element it boils its 1.5l max capacity fairly quickly, shuts off reliably, and retains heat well because of its jacketed design. The cordless feature is essential in my view for any modern kettle.\n\nThe kettle is beautiful and it gets not hot to the touch due to it's double wall. It's attractive and easy to handle. It definitely boils the water but makes a little noise while getting to a boil. I would definitely use it for my tea every day."},{"reviewerName":"Marshall J. Guthrie","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Solid design, classy looks, wide fill opening. An essential kitchen appliance.","reviewDate":"September 18, 2019","reviewText":"I can’t believe I only bought an electric kettle this year. There’s nothing wrong with an old-fashioned kettle on the stove, but this electric kettle boils much faster and is much safer thanks to the insulated case. We start every morning with tea and oatmeal, and also heat our newborns milk in cups of hot water, so this has reduced our dishes, saved us time, and kept us safe.\n\nThere’s not much to highlight because operation is dead simple. Fill it with water and flip the switch. It turns itself off when ready, and works like a charm. The modern steel and sleek black appearance will work great in upscale kitchens and the exterior seems easy to clean if you get fingerprints or food on it. Food Grade stainless liner is clearly marked and the large opening makes filling easy, though I do miss the fill window of my last unit. Still, this one has less points of failure with a solid stainless interior, so perhaps a worthy trade-off.\n\nIf you don’t have an electric kettle, get one. You’ll be surprised at how many uses you find for it."},{"reviewerName":"RockNRolla","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Heats up water FAST, and easy to use!","reviewDate":"June 2, 2019","reviewText":" This kettle works better than I expected! I started off by rinsing the kettle and filling it with water using my Brita filter. I plugged in the device base and settled the kettle on top. After that, you press the tab that’s located under the handle and the device instantly heats up. It literally took only a few minutes for the water to boil. Once it started bubbling, the device automatically shut off, which is good because sometimes I forget to check!\n\nMy passion tea came out perfect having this kettle, I would definitely recommend it.

Tea, coffee press, college student (we don’t boil them - but they eat a LOT of ramen, cup o’noodles & miso soup) then there’s a baby coming, so sterilizing & formula-making. All that to say that on a daily basis we use a kettle 1-5x/day.\n\nOur eldest got married and moved out and was seriously missing our kettle. For comparison’s sake, we’ve got a Cuisinart CPK-17 that we spent over $100 on in 2011. So in looking for a new one for our son, we wanted to find insulated, easy to clean/access (ours is NOT, as it’s pre-descaling model) w/temp control for different teas.\n\nThe reviews on this one don’t lie - though this model lacks a “Keep Warm” feature, the double-wall construction keeps it warmer, longer than our fully insulated model. It heats the water quickly and seemingly accurately (I haven’t temp-checked but it’s not overheating for Green & White tea settings). Consistently comes to a full boil within 2-3mins as ours did when new. The other HUGE feature is the lid and access inside, since it doesn’t contain a de-scale filter/feature. The higher-end ones we’ve liked most don’t have this degree of access and once you’ve had it a few years, it’s nice when boiling with lemon, vinegar or baking soda to still be able to scrub around the spout and internal bottom rim. You can absolutely do so with this one! Also, we’ve had kettles that started to leak and do not see any locations where this could occur on this one. Lastly, it is quiet. We’ve noticed many less expensive models are loud. This matters for those with babies, making early morning coffee/tea or in close quarters.\n\nThe primary features this does NOT contain vs higher-end models are de-scale, window/water-level indicator and Keep Warm feature. Beyond water level window, the features this kettle has mitigates the features lacking quite well! Thus far, with the daily use this gets at their home (I also tested for a couple days, as we have a feeling we’ll need to replace ours soon) nothing has stood out as missing or sub-par beyond water-level indicator.\n\nThat said - as much as we use ours and it’s lasted almost 9yrs - it has auto-shut off (So element doesn’t burn out boiling water away) and we’ve always been careful to add water nearly every use as it’s better for kettle not to boil when level is low... so lack of level indicator may only be an issue where only one person is using here and there.\n\nOverall this is excellent quality, well-featured and a great value! I highly recommend, even to high frequency users. As we will replace our own likely soon, we’re now looking at the newer model w/the clear body. Prior to this experience, we’d only considered another Cuisinart or the Breville kettles at 2x+ the price. So it’s safe to say Minoco has impressed us.\n\nWe will update if any issues arise."},{"reviewerName":"Sine kunakorn","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Very quick to boil water!","reviewDate":"August 2, 2019","reviewText":"I have always hesitate to buy anything like this as I thought it is unnecessary for just boiling water.

So after multiple reviews of this guy, I decided to give it a try and WOW!! it is a game changing. Normally, it would take about 5 mins+ to get to boil water on my electric stove. Now, with this electric kettle, it surprisingly take less than 2-3 mins to boil a bottle of water. The mug is very sturdy and has sleek design too.

Spout is thick - making for more dribbly pouring - say into cone filter for coffee. My old kettle had solid metal spout and was much thinner/less dribbly\n4.

I ordered this for our church for Coffee Hour, for the tea drinkers, and tested it out at home first. Now I’m ordering one for myself! It made the house less hot than my stove kettle (nice in summer), is cool to the touch on the outside (safer around children), used less electricity than my electric stove (good for the budget and environment), and was super speedy at heating the water (good for a busy mom and work-at-home person who often forgot she left the pot boiling because duty called). Yup, this tea kettle is a winner. Stainless steel on ALL parts that touch water, insulated, cool to the touch on the outside, and flawless in its auto shut-off. I didn’t want one for myself originally, because I prize my counter space. But this kettle is so handy and convenient, it is worth the sacrifice. I highly recommend it."},{"reviewerName":"J. Gordon Roy","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"It does what it promised","reviewDate":"September 6, 2019","reviewText":"We had been a bit cautious about buying this kettle, as we had bought a similar kettle just one month earlier. That kettle was advertised as 'cool touch' as well. That other kettle, by a different manufacturer, did have a cool body, but on occasions - usually when we boiled water in the kettle twice or three times in quick succession - the handle became so hot that we could not hold it until it had cooled down. We asked and got a refund on that kettle.\nAs our Miroco kettle looked very similar, we were concerned that it was made by the same manufacturer, just under a different brand name. We are delighted to report that the kettle is better in every way than the one we had to replace. Not only does the handle stay absolutely cool and appears not to change in temperature at all, even when used repeatedly, it has a great pop up lid for refilling which also ensures that the lid snaps shut easily, making it a proper seal. Also it is very quick to boil water.\nThe only disappointment we have had is that we would have preferred a 1.0 liter kettle and this 1.5 liter kettle was the smallest capacity we could find. That does not detract from how the kettle works though. We are thrilled with our purchase."},{"reviewerName":"Dennis Kennedy","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Steel interior, lightweight, does what it says it does","reviewDate":"July 11, 2019","reviewText":"It'll boil a liter and a half of water in about 5 minutes, and it's about as hard to use as a toaster.

No need to worry about dry-boiling a pot to death, or enjoying a house fire with your Earl Grey, or having the base melt a new circle into an old sideboard.\n\nIn short, it's fun, convenient, and worth the money. My only peccadillo is that you get boiling water, and that's it - you can't set the temperature, so no fine-tuning tea without a bit of experimentation first. But, if you're that worried about having just the right temperature for your dragon pearls or hibiscus petals, you're probably not using an electric kettle, either.

It’s a sleek black design and looks nice on my slate countertop. Boiling the water takes no time at all. My only beef with this pot is that the spout has holes where you pour the hot water, instead of being open. The water tends to spritz a bit and doesn’t pour smoothly, but I’ve learned to pour gently.

When I forgot that I was heating the water and taking a walk, I went looking for a smart enough kettle to close. I chose this model because it is reasonably priced, there are some glass models I am staring at, but I have some anti-surfing pets that have destroyed at least one glass French press, so they are a tough pass.\nThe kettle heats up very quickly and is very fast, and it automatically shuts down when it boils.

Ford","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Design Flaw","reviewDate":"June 9, 2019","reviewText":"****UPDATED REVIEW****\nI had only one issue in that the leak would burn me. After customer service reached out to me multiple times to replace it I thought why not. Not only did they replace the kettle they shipped out a frother too. I have used them both multiple times already per day and have not had any issues. It seems as thought the main problem I was having with the kettle is no longer an issue. I really like the kettle and will be using this from now on. I have multiple frothers. One at work, home, etc. I was pleasantly surprised on how much better the frother works then the ones I have.\n\nI have now changed my 1 star review to 5 stars. This is mainly for their Customer Service. Any company that backs up their product and has great customer service, is a winner. Nowadays getting someone at customer service is like finding a needle in a haystack.\n\n****UPDATED REVIEW 08/26/19 BELOW****\nAfter initially stating below how there is a design flaw I stand behind my original review and now downgrade this 1 star. I have not heard anything from the seller and now I am receiving what looks like spam email associated with this sale. I am not sure how and when I tried to contact the seller through Amazon I was denied. Here's Amazons response:\n\nWe are sorry to let you know that your email to MirocoDirect - Amazon Marketplace cannot be delivered because the order it is in regards to is either invalid or not between you and the recipient. We apologize for the inconvenience.\n\nIf the seller reads these comments can you contact me? If not I am throwing the kettle out after getting burned a couple of times because of this design flaw.\n\nI at this time cannot say anything about the seller in that there has been little to no response. Do yourself a favor and look for another kettle that will not BURN you!\n\n****ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW****\n\nThis kettle is the perfect size. After using this for a couple of weeks now I have to say one thing. There is a major flaw in the design where the button to open he lid and the seam are. Meaning anyone who grabs the handle and uses their thumb to put on top of the handle WILL GET BURNED! There is a seam that steam visible comes out and if your not careful will get you. I like the overall design but this flaw will eventually have me discard this after getting burned a few times. As You can see in the photo where there is water condensation from the seam it’s not safe."},{"reviewerName":"Megan","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Easy clean nice black color","reviewDate":"March 29, 2019","reviewText":"I love it match my kitchen so cool"},{"reviewerName":"Whitney W","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"My favorite electric kettle","reviewDate":"April 6, 2019","reviewText":"This electric kettle is exactly what I was looking for!

I wish I could give them five stars overall, but I did feel like the actual original item has a design that made it not work for me.\n\nThe fact that there is no way to tell from the outside what the water level is turns out to be really irritating.

Usually just above minimum or midway full pour it in the glass when it's done and then pour the rest out and let it dry before the next use. We've only had this particular model for about 2 weeks, we bought it when a similar companies kettle had a piece break off.\n\nThis model tends to not release the steam as much so when you're pouring the excess out and you pop open the top at the end to make sure it's all gone you need to sort of angle your hand so you don't steam yourself. Otherwise it's awesome quick heating super simple process to use. You just pour the water in to the desired level close the lid drop it on the stand and click the go switch. Takes a couple minutes usually just depends on how much water you put in. 9/10 would buy again if the quality maintains through the life of the product."},{"reviewerName":"James","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Easy to use, modern look","reviewDate":"April 30, 2019","reviewText":"This kettle is not fancy.

Since I had attempted to use it past the return date, I didn't try to contact them about a refund - I got a different kettle. However, they contacted me after all that had gone down and offered to send me a replacement kettle and a milk frother. Their take is that my bad kettle was an anomoly. Since I had already gotten another kettle - they then offered me a refund - which was generous since I was unable to return the defective kettle to them. So overall I'd say my experience was that Customer service was excellent and if you do happen to get a defective kettle it sounds like they will go out of their way to satisfy you - so definitely contact them.\n\nOriginal Review: Sadly I didn't return this in the window so out my $30+ bucks. While it is stainless steel inside this kettle makes the water taste awful. There is a smell that I thought would go away with some use, at first it seemed to be getting better - but no, over a month later its still there. Worried there is something toxic going on in here ... coating on the steel? something leaching from the heating elements? Worried about health issues with this one. And to top it off, really makes tea taste awful."},{"reviewerName":"Jeanette","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great product!","reviewDate":"June 10, 2019","reviewText":"This was my first electric kettle and I absolutely love it. I use it primarily to hear up water for.my French pressed coffee. The kettle heats the water to the necessary temp in less than 4 mins. The full 5 minutes timer will bring the water to a full boil which is too hot for French pressed coffee. I've learned to listen for the \"pre boiling sound\" and take kettle to stop heating. The base and on switch are so easy to use. The base automatically turns off at 5 mins or when you pick up the kettle. The inside of the kettle is very smooth and therefore really easy to clean. The spring loaded lid is very secure; it will not open while pouring and will stay open once you press the lever for easy filling and cleaning. The outside of the kettle is well insulated as always coll to touch so you need not worth about burning yourself as you would with metal kettles."},{"reviewerName":"Mandy","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"good","reviewDate":"May 31, 2019","reviewText":"The working principle of the electric kettle is that the water vapor generated when the water boils causes the bimetal of the steam sensing element to be deformed, and the deformation pushes the power switch off by the lever principle. The power failure is not self-resetting, so the kettle will not automatically reheat after the power is turned off.\nThe electric kettle was born in Chicago in 1891. With the development of science and technology, fast, safe, convenient and full use of energy has become the main feature of the kettle. The English-loving British have fallen in love with it since then. In the 21st century, it has become a global best seller. The electric kettle adopts the steam intelligent induction temperature control, which has the function of automatically powering off after the water boils, preventing the dry burning and power off. With the needs of life, the current electric kettle is also developing in a multi-functional direction, such as leak prevention, anti-scalding, and water lock. The electric kettle has the advantages of fast heating speed, good heat preservation effect, strong filtering function and many styles."},{"reviewerName":"Guy on the couch","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"2 weeks in and its my favorite kettle","reviewDate":"July 30, 2019","reviewText":"We've gone through dozens of kettles, over the years being heavy tea drinkers.

I did lots of research before purchasing it. I live in Canada and it is not available on Amazon.ca, so I ordered it here and paid import and duties on it. Still worth it. Easy to clean, boils fast, cool touch on the outside. And most important, only stainless steel actually touches the water. No plastic windows or tubes or gimmicks. Just clean boiled water.

Same thing happened to our first kettle. Figured if it happened w both then they probably all do that. So not the best quality.

Otherwise this is the perfect kettle."},{"reviewerName":"Kevin","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"The insulation is good！","reviewDate":"May 18, 2019","reviewText":"Very good product, I bought glass and stainless steel before it, the glass kettle is easy to break, the stainless steel without heat insulation setting is easy to be scalded. The main reason why I choose this kind of kettle is that I like its heat insulation design, which can be safely touched, and its appearance is also very beautiful. It is also the same as what is said in the introduction, which can boil water quickly and keep the temperature warm in a short time.

They tend to work faster than a stove and for that matter are way more portable than a stove too. I can use this at home or work or college. This is a very large size which I love, and the auto open lid is a nice feature. My biggest thing is it's slightly harder to clean because the lid only opens so far rather than opening all the way straight up. If y'all could fix or change the model for the lid to open more, that would make this perfect :) thanks!"},{"reviewerName":"linguangfei","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Happy With My Purchase","reviewDate":"May 19, 2019","reviewText":"I don’t like drinking cold water in winter.

And soak coffee for five mins. Put the fillter on top of your cup, and pour coffee. There you go. You don’t need to get a coffee machine or french press if you want to save space.\n\nThis water kettle has no plastic touching the water which was the main reason I bought it."},{"reviewerName":"Y.","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"great product","reviewDate":"August 21, 2019","reviewText":"It's a great product.

I didn't need a super fancy expensive all glass one and this electric kettle seemed to have really good reviews so I went for it! Initially I washed it and did a test run twice and dumped out the water, but it still had a metallic taste. I do not taste is now, but there is mineral deposit stains already on the bottom inside of the kettle. I haven't tried cleaning it with the vinegar/lime yet because it doesn't really bother me and isn't that bad yet. Overall really easy to use kettle and heats up quick! However, it doesn't keep the water hot for long if you leave it in the kettle for more than 30 minutes so I usually pour it into a thermos. I love how it's pretty much all stainless steel wherever the water touches so it doesn't have contact with plastic. It's a lightweight kettle and is pretty easy to pour and isn't too bulky or heavy!"},{"reviewerName":"Michael","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Fast, simple and easy to clean.","reviewDate":"August 15, 2019","reviewText":"I rarely leave feedback, but I always look for reviews, so I thought I should give back on this one. We're European so we have always used one of these, but they are gaining popularity in the USA. They should all be fast and easy, it isn't complicated to boil water! This one looks nice on our counter. And it is easy to clean. If you are new to electric kettles, the key issue is the ability to clean INSIDE. This one has a large opening, the lid opens fully and the interior chamber is completely smooth, so it is a breeze to clean, which keeps the family healthy and our tea delicious.\n\nAlso, for those who are just starting to use these, they allow the user to boil one cup if that's all you need. That saves energy, helps the environment and speeds up the process.\n\nThe key design element of this unit is the ability to easily clean the interior. Well done."},{"reviewerName":"Jason Xiao","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Very Satisfied","reviewDate":"July 21, 2019","reviewText":"Bought for my company.

Combine this with a insulated tumbler and your water will stay hot all day. Definitely would recommend if you need hot water quickly!

Resolved issues with company!","reviewDate":"August 3, 2019","reviewText":"I was initially disappointed with this kettle because it had a horrible smell all over when I first got it, even though I did several rounds of boiling water and vinegar water. The smell dissipated after about 4 days. The button mechanism to open the lid still has a slight smell after just over a week, but I have to actually put my nose to it to smell it, whereas before the entire kettle had a smell you couldn’t ignore. I was also concerned that the box had a BPA and lead warning despite the description saying it was BPA free.\n\nHowever, the company quickly got in touch with me and put my worries to rest. The smell is a result of the product being sealed in the packaging, and the company even sent me the results of the independent testing done on the product that proves it is free of BPA, lead and other chemicals. They also explained that the BPA and lead warning is a California state requirement - I looked into it and based on the wording of the requirement many companies are putting a warning on products just to avoid potential fines. Basically, the law doesn’t really make sense.\n\nBased on the information the company provided, my research, and the fast and efficient customer service I received (they did provide compensation to me, but no strings attached to it - this is an honest review), I changed my initial review from 2 stars to 5 stars. Also, I love the look of the kettle and the fact it is all stainless steel inside, it boils fast, and now I feel confident the kettle is chemical free!\n\nUPDATE: I was sent a replacement kettle to try. There was a very slight initial smell in the kettle, probably from the packaging, but after a few hours airing it was completely gone. No smell at all now, just like it should be!!\n\nI am very happy with the kettle and the excellent customer service!!"},{"reviewerName":"Gina A.","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Fast, Easy Use","reviewDate":"August 11, 2019","reviewText":"This electric kettle from Miroco is just what I needed for my office at work! It heats rapidly and quietly to the perfect temperature for tea, instant cereal, and instant hot cocoa.\n\nThe interior is stamped sus304, which is the Japanese equivalent of SAE 304. This is 18/8 stainless steel in the cooking industry. Under normal use and good care, this will not rust nor pit.\n\nIt heats quickly, in under 5 mins, then shuts off. This a well thought out insulated design, retaining heat inside, yet cool to the touch outside. NOTE: Do take care when pouring as this is hot water with rising steam, and steam burns more than hot water.\n\nClean up is recommended when not in use. I wipe mine out with a paper towel before storage and keep the platform unplugged unless in use.\n\nIf you have hard water, you'll want to occasionally descale with something acidic like vinegar, lemon juice, or a can of Coke.\n\nOverall, this is quality product of sleek design and easy functionality. I highly recommended this Miroco 1.5 L electric kettle."},{"reviewerName":"E. F. Panighetti","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Simple to use","reviewDate":"September 24, 2019","reviewText":"After going through some kettles, and having this for about a week, I appreciate the simplicity of it.\nIt has a nice, understated black polished finish.\nThe only control is the toggle at the bottom of the handle that lights up slightly when on. That's it.\nIt takes about 5 minute to boil, when 3/4 full (you don't want to fill it more than that) -- We're at about sea level.\nIt's not too hot to the touch, and the interior is completely stainless steel, in one piece. The inside of the lid is also metal. The only plastic exposed to water is the tip of the sprout. Which does not boil, but gets in touch with the water when pouring.\nUnlike many other kettles we have, the whole lid opens, close to 90 degrees. This and that the interior is a single piece of metal makes it a lot simpler to clean.\nThe base is black plastic, and the cable is a two-prong, and although the cable is somewhat short, it can be wound inside the base.\n\nTidbit on home automation: This kettle goes back to basics in functionality. It's switch is not electronic like in many new kettles, but it's a time-tested thermal switch. To automate it, get a smart plug (like Alexa Switch or similar), or a timer switch. Leave it off, and push down the switch on the kettle. The switch will remain on until it's powered back on, and it will release when the water is boiling.\n\nWhy five stars: It's very simple to use, aesthetically pleasing and understated (subjective), takes about 5 minutes to boil and the interior is a single piece of stainless steel, which should make keeping it clean a lot easier."},{"reviewerName":"Simon Sayz","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Perfect Boiler without having to worry about Fire","reviewDate":"September 20, 2019","reviewText":"This kettle is amazing.

I was a little reluctant to buy a plastic kettle since it’s going to be boiling water inside, but the glass one I own is bulky and super heavy. The inside is metal, so that’s a plus. I needed a smaller, lighter version for a week long trip, so I bought this hoping it would be a better fit for the hotel room than the glass kettle. The kettle is very lightweight, boils water quickly, which is what I needed to steep my tea in the morning, and maybe fix some ramen for a snack. It doesn’t keep the water hot for long, unlike the double wall glass kettle. I pour it into a thermos for my tea, so I don’t need it to stay hot for long. The black coating is pretty cool looking, but I don’t know if there will be water stains on the black exterior after a few uses, I’ve only used it about three times. It’s a lot more convenient and safer than a traditional kettle due to its auto shut off switch. The kettle’s switch turns red after you flip the switch, so you don’t have to wonder if it’s on, and it does make some noises while boiling. I’ve also had my father-in-law add water to it after I’m done with it, and use it right away, without waiting for it to cool down, and we didn’t notice any issues like overheating."},{"reviewerName":"Mindy P","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Lightweight electric kettle and easy to use.","reviewDate":"September 1, 2019","reviewText":" Good size for any family.

When I opened it today, the size was unexpectedly large and the speed of boiling water was Fast, the water capacity is also loaded, enough for me to make three pots of tea. The appearance is also beautiful, the black is not resistant to dirt, and the water is large, so it is easy to clean the inside of the kettle.

For real tea fanatics, it can be difficult to get just the right temperature water for your brew and nuking H2O in the microwave is simply out of the question. That's where electric kettles come in. If you’re a coffee drinker or a tea lover, an electric kettle is a great addition to your kitchen counter. Electric kettles bring water to a rolling boil faster than a microwave or conventional tea kettle. They have automatic shut-off safety controls, which means no more pots or cups boiling over, great for those bleary-eyed, distracted early mornings, and variable temperature controls so you can choose the perfect brewing temperature for your beverage. Quickly boiling water in an electric kettle can also help with making pasta, cooking soups, or even with blanching vegetables.\n\nThis electric kettle from Miroco, It’s a handy tool that can quickly become your most valued kitchen companion. It boil water faster than a watched pot on your stove, and the best ones even offer adjustable temperature settings to ensure that the water is just right for your delicate tea leaves. You can also use electric kettles to boil water quickly for any cause, whether its oatmeal, instant noodles, or a packet of soup. No matter your needs, it's good to have a dedicated appliance in your kitchen that boils water quickly. Every self-respecting British person has a kettle at home, and the fact that most Americans don't is totally befuddling. The kettle is stainless steel will last you a few years at least. If you want black or herbal tea, just hit boil and watch the water within six minutes or less. The kettle automatically stops boiling when it runs dry with its thermostat feature to ensure safety.\n\nThe kettle packs 1500 watts of power to ensure that the water heats up in about 6 to 7 minutes. The handle is big and comfortable for easy handling and pouring. We've been using it daily for nearly a month without any problems."},{"reviewerName":"Alex","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"pretty good","reviewDate":"May 7, 2019","reviewText":" love this water bottle cause it works good\npretty design and so fast to make hot water\nalso it is quilt to use\nlooooove it so much"},{"reviewerName":"JRL","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great product for the price","reviewDate":"April 16, 2019","reviewText":"I use my kettle that I purchased at a local store every night to make my tea.

Of course as soon as I set up I heated up the water. One thing I noticed is that it is not at loud as the one I have which was a relief. Also, it heats up the water pretty fast and the water is as hot as I am used to. I am very happy with the purchase and I recommend this product to anyone.

I haven't done the max setting yet, but at the minimum line fill it will heat up in 2 minutes which is kinda insane for morning coffee making (the min line marker justtt makes 2 cups btw). I've also never had a water boiler before so I can't compare it to other designs (maybe 2 min is normal??), but this thing is pretty nifty. I've only had it for a few days so I obviously can't speak to wear and tear but I will update this review is something comes up. The flap you can lock up or down which is nice for when you're using it or trying to let it dry out.\n\nFYI: The machine also came with a piece of paper in it that allows you sign up for some warranty program they have online using your amazon order number that gives an additional 8 month warranty and a 180 day free return shipping.

I wanted simple - nothing digital, no extra gimmicks or buttons that can break easily - and all one piece (no silly filters that jump out or fall out like our old one). I also wanted insulated, as our last one was not and I have burn scars from reaching over it or around it when hot and forgetting that it was hot. This one has all the features I was looking for:\n-on/of button seems very sturdy.\n-it heats water quickly.\n-all stainless steel inside (we have a high mineral content in our water, so that was important)\n-insulated keeps my water hot longer and added bonus !!!- I don't get burned if I'm working around it!\n-automatic shut off switch (I contemplated a stovetop kettle, but with 3 teenage boys, the chances of burning the house down with that option increase significantly).\n\nSomeone mentioned that it dribbles water.

The interior, and everything that the water touches with this kettle, is metal, which is great. Also, the water heats up incredibly fast, and stays hot for a long time. My only complaint - and the reason I give four rather than five starts - is because if you leave the water in the kettle, it develops a metallic taste. Is this a big deal? Not really. Just dump out the water between uses and refill when you need it. Nonetheless, I followed the instructions about heating up a few pots and dumping the water before use. Did that, and it did not work.

So nice to have a cool touch and auto shutoff kettle instead of using your stove to boil water and leave the house and worry if you turned it off when you're leaving in the morning.
