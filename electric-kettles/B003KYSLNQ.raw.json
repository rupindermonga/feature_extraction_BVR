CUISINART'S \"LIMITED WARRANTY' MAY BE LEGAL, BUT IT'S NEAR-FRAUDULENT!\n\nI bought this kettle in September, 2015 and it failed in December, 2015. The one-year warranty is USELESS. When I called for troubleshooting, they shipped me a replacement for the base. The replacement took almost a month to arrive, and was dead on arrival. It may have been defective, but most likely, the kettle was at fault. When I called to request that they replace the kettle, I discovered that (1) I'd have to ship the kettle back to them first, and (2) I'd need to enclose an extra $15 payment to cover Cuisinart's return shipping expense for the replacement unit...because the kettle only has \"a limited warranty.\" So (counting $15, plus my own packaging and shipping cost) I'm being to told to expend at least $30 in order to get a replacement for a unit I had for three months--a unit that has never been abused or mistreated in any way.\nThis is a PREMIUM product. It should have a PREMIUM warranty policy--just ship me the replacement, place a hold on my credit card until I return the bad one in the replacement packaging, etc. And the manufacturer pays for shipping both ways. This is common practice for other high-end products (and most Amazon returns), and I think it's inexcusable that Cuisinart takes an approach that seems DESIGNED TO AVOID having to honor their warranty.\nThe representative was polite and professional throughout, but could not allow me to speak to her supervisor \"because of the heavy call volume.\"\nShe gave me the runaround; it's not her fault, she's just doing her job. Like any employee, she has to carry out her employer's policy. But Cuisinart's policy in INEXCUSABLE; it's not worth paying to replace the unit, and I'm never buying any Cuisinart product again.\n\nDO NOT BUY THIS UNIT IF YOU EVER EXPECT TO NEED SERVICE UNDER WARRANTY!!"},{"reviewerName":"a_riot","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Dangerous flaw and not built to last","reviewDate":"January 3, 2018","reviewText":" UPDATE: I am updating this review after discovering a dangerous flaw with this kettle. The kettle is supposed to shut off automatically when it boils, and it usually does, but every couple of weeks it just doesn't, and just continues to boil, even though all lights are off. Luckily I've been home every time this has happened, and so I unplugged it to turn it off. Even lifting it off the base doesn't turn it off, as it just starts boiling again when you put it down. If it was left like this, the water would all boil away, and since the kettle thinks it's already off, I'm not sure what would happen at that point. It has a feature that turns it off when there's no water in it, but that works when its on, and I'm not sure if it would work when it thinks it's off. I reported this to Cuisinart customer service but other than offering me a 20% discount on a new one, didn't seem to be too concerned.\n\nI had high hopes for this kettle, as it had some features I wanted, but in usage its not all that great, and the durability is poor. The first issue was the warning sound it makes when it boils, a critical feature. Its pretty much inaudible, 3 beeps from a circuit board mounted device that can't even be heard over the boiling water its so quiet. Since it auto shuts off once boiling, you end up walking over to it to check on it, and then have to restart it and wait for 30 seconds as it reboils. As well, all the lettering from the buttons wears away within a few weeks, and now my lid has failed, and won't open when I hit the button, so I have to pry it open with my fingernails. The lid can't be removed for cleaning inside. There is also some kind of dark stain on the bottom of it even though its only ever had tap water in it. Not sure what this brown stuff is but given all the other issues, this is not a kettle I would recommend, and now I have to buy another kettle after spending a lot of money on this one. I have Milwaukee power tools that cost less and have a 5 year warranty, so I'm not sure why Cuisinart can't do a little better."},{"reviewerName":"John Fitzpatrick","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"The slow demise until entropy takes over!","reviewDate":"August 12, 2016","reviewText":"Purchased this product from Amazon on May the 8th 2013 and today (8/12/16) three years later it has expired.

Are they comparable?","reviewDate":"June 2, 2019","reviewText":"Several reputable consumer tests rank the Cuisinart CPK-17 adjustable temperature tea kettle at the very top. That caught my eye. But so did its high price--almost double the also nicely designed Miroco MI-EK001. Both have the same 1.7 liter (57 ounce) capacity, with very similar features. I bought the Cuisinart first but was intrigued by the Miroco at roughly half the price so I bought it, too. I had earlier compared the Hamilton Beach 41020 to the Cuisinart but found its workmanship not nearly as good, and its lack of temperature accuracy disappointing. In my opinion, the highest quality appliances should be fairly priced, but reliable and also of long term value.\n\nSpoiler alert! Can the Miroco compete at half the price? REMARKABLY WELL although its features are not identical. The Cuisinart does offer offer small convenience advantages depending on your household’s priorities.\n\nCuisinart CPK-17 vs. Miroco MI-EK001/ Design:\nAs you can see in the photos, both designs are similar, but not identical. The Cuisinart weighs a couple of ounces more than the Miroco, noticeable when filling when empty but not when pouring with water inside. The Miroco has a slightly wider pop up lid with two separate buttons for opening and closing. That may make the Moroco easier to fill for those with less pouring dexterity, yet both models have ample filling room.\n\nFor better balance with the Cuisinart I have to “choke up” (a baseball term) on it’s handle with my fingers over the temp controls but this has never been a problem. Before trying the Miroco, I thought its squared-off shape handle might be uncomfortable. However, since I have medium sized hands, I prefer it to the Cuisinart’s slightly more bulbous handle. All things considered, the ergonomics of the handle on the Miroco is a small advantage.\n\nCuisinart CPK-17 tea kettle vs. Miroco MI-EK001 / Workmanship:\nThis was a very pleasant surprise. When I compared the Hamilton Beach near clone of the Cuisinart, one big difference was cheaper workmanship for the HB. No so with the Moroco. Beautiful, smoothly machined and solid. Both brands are quality appliances and impressively built. Both have similar fill windows that turn a pleasant blue while on. The Cuisinart only shows liters while the Microco shows cups as well as liters. I find the Miroco slightly easier to read. While the lid designs are different, I prefer Cuisinart’s open button which can be accomplished one handed. For the Miroco, using only one hand, you can’t open the lid at the same time as holding the handle.\n\nCuisinart CPK-17 vs. Miroco MI-EK001 / Temp choices and features:\nThe two kettles have virtually the same features. As you can see in the photo, the design approaches are different. Both have a great feature that will allow you to hold the brewing temp for another 30 minutes. So, what is different between the two brands? For the Cuisinart, the keep warm feature is on by default—it can also easily be turned off—either before or after brewing. For the Miroco, the default is off and the keep warm button must be pressed manually. Due to busy mornings in our house, I prefer the Cuisinart design with the default to be on automatically. As an example, I typically wake up first, have a cup of green tea brewed at the proper 175 degrees and then wait for my wife to join me. Everything is ready to go with no additional button pushes needed. Later, we’ll pour water for oatmeal for our daughter. All can be poured at the same temp held by the kettle. However, if you typically would not need a second cup, perhaps you might prefer the Miroco approach. Turning on its keep warm feature is easy, especially before brewing.\n\nSince we pour multiple cups, one other Cuisinart advantage we really like is a memory feature. If you take the kettle off the base, then return it to the base within a couple of minutes, the Cuisinart keeps the temperature and hold setting. As soon as the Miroco is removed to pour, when returned to the base, the tea kettle is fully shut off. This may be a disadvantage for some. However, to get back to the settings to hold the kettle for 30 minutes longer requires a few quick button presses, easy to do in only takes a couple of seconds. You just need to get in the habit of remembering.\n\nCuisinart CPK-17 vs. Miroco MI-EK001 / All important performance tests:\nAs both are 1500 watts, each has terrific, fast speed far surpassing stovetop kettles or microwave heating. For a full 1.7 liter pot (57 ounces), the Cuisinart shut off at the 212 degree boiling point in 7:06. The Miroco took 7:35. In everyday real world usage, this is not a meaningful difference yet the Cuisinart is slightly faster. For 24 ounces, the Cuisinart finished in just 3:31 and for 16 ounces, it was done in only 2:32. The Miroco was not far behind. Plenty quick all around.\n\nAt the green tea setting of 175 degrees, the Cuisinart took just 2:22 for 24 ounces, and a terrific 1:40 for 16 ounces. The Miroco finished 24 ounces in 2:40, and for 16 ounces, just 1:52.\n\nBoth of these pots are very well insulated. Even an hour or two after turning off, the water inside is still plenty hot. If initially set to boil, a full hour after turning off the Moroco is still at 178, while the Cuisinart is slightly cooler at 167. Each can be brought back to a full boil in just a minute or two, depending on how much water is inside.\n\nCuisinart CPK-17 vs. Miroco MI-EK001 / Temperature consistency:\nWhen brewing to 212 degrees, both brands hit the boiling point and are ready to pour. Yet, it is likely that in buying a versatile temp variable kettle like these, you may also care about consistency at different temperatures, and in using the keep warm setting. For example, Chinese green teas are best brewed between 170 and 180, while delicate Japanese Senchas benefit from 10 degrees cooler yet. When using each kettle’s 175 degree setting for green tea, as soon as the brewer beeped and stopped, I used a Thermapen instant read thermometer and learned the Cuisinart measured 176 degrees. Excelllent performance indeed!\n\nFor the same test at the 175 degree setting, the Miroco was 182 degrees but quickly dropped down into the mid to upper 170s. Whatever your preferred brewing temp, keep in mind that as soon as the water hits your cup, it will cool slightly more. Thus, the Miroco’s performance was also quite good—far more consistent than the less than satisfying Hamilton Beach clone of the Cuisinart I reviewed earlier.\n\nWhat about temp consistency using keep warm feature? Once desired temp is reached, each kettle will sit idle until the internal water temp drops 6-8 degrees. Then a sensor kicks in, very briefly turns on the kettle for mere seconds, bringing the temp back in range. Both brands did well using the keep warm setting.\n\nCuisinart CPK-17 vs. Miroco MI-EK001 / Warranty and the long term:\nAlthough Cuisinart has a laudable three-year warranty, several reviewers here complain that obtaining warranty service can be cumbersome and that the units sometimes go out before the warranty has expired. The buyer must pay for warranty shipping both ways. I paid $4 extra for the Assurant extended warranty. However, most warranties of this type only kick in after manufacturer warranty expires. Keeping fingers crossed! We own four Cuisinart small kitchen appliances and have never needed warranty service, happily. My original Cuisinart food processor works great after 30 years.\n\nConcerning the CPK-17 kettle, several reviews state the number markings can rub off in time. This is not a concern with Miroco’s design—the markings lie beneath an acetate covering. Miroco’s warranty is 18 months warranty plus an 18-month extension with registration.\n\nCuisinart CPK-17 vs. Miroco MI-EK001 / Conclusion: These are both five star machines. We are keeping the Cuisinart at our main home and the Miroco at our vacation home. The differences between Cuisinart and Miroco are mainly differentiated by three things: 1) The keep warm feature is the automatic default for the Cuisinart but can easily turned on with the Miroco. 2) The Cuisinart has a handy two-minute memory feature that remembers the keep warm temp setting if the kettle is removed, then returned to the base. 3) If those features are considered crucial to some, the Cuisinart runs nearly double the cost, yet is well known brand name with a long term track record.\n\nHere are two links that may be of help to you:\n\nThis first link compares the Cuisinart CPK-17 compared to the Hamilton Beach 41020.

By December it had ceased to work at all. After multiple email and telephone exchanges seeking to verify the serial number and assure that the product was not used commercially (it was not), I was informed that the the product was covered by a \"Limited\" warranty, meaning that I would have to pay to return the product to Cuisinart and pay $15 for shipping and handling for a replacement product. I think it is unacceptable for a reputable manufacturer to sell a product that has clearly failed (in under 3 months of use) and expect the customer to pay to have the product replaced. Replacement of the product in this situation should be \"no questions asked\" and at no cost to the customer. Furthermore, I can't understand why Cuisinart would not want me to return the failed product so that they can figure why it failed. Unless they already know ...\n\nUpdate: After much back and forth, Cuisinart offered to waive the $15 replacement service fee, but would not take responsibility for the cost of returning the defective device. I refused and have recycled the kettle. Coincidently, I had a recent customer service issue with a Cuisinart competitor, SharkNinja. In this case SharkNinja offered to replace the defective product. They wanted me to return the defective device so that their engineers could determine the reason for the failure. They immediately shipped a replacement, and emailed a pre-paid shipping label for the return. That's how a warranty and customer service are supposed to work!

We love our electric kettle so much that I bought a second to give to my mom for Christmas this year (no more being afraid she'll forget to take the kettle off and maybe burn down her house)(semi-sarcastic concern).

This product falls right in the mid range of prices, but has qualities that make it better than the price tag. It has a large capacity in the reservoir and I can easily make 5 mugs of hot chocolate or tea to satisfy everyone immediately. I really like the variable temperature so that I can better gauge cool down time and do some subtle brewing as I learn more about teas. I also love the stay warm feature so that I can go back for a second cup any time. Even if it cools, don't worry, this heats a pot faster than a single mug in the microwave.\nIf asked a few days ago I would have nothing bad to say about this kettle, but having used it for just a little over a month and half, it has developed a squeal when it brews. I can't figure out why and it is a bit ear piercing. It was pretty silent until now.

This is a really dangerous product flaw and I reported it to The Consumer Product Safety Commission. I filed a warranty request but instead of receiving a replacement, I was asked to return the defective kettle and fill out a form that asks questions like \"Did you read the instructions?\" So they expect me to sit and wait for their \"engineers\" to find out what is wrong with this kettle when in 2019, mine is not the only one that has experienced this flaw.

Everyone uses it, the temperature controls are excellent (and were what sold me on this model), and I use it more than I would have thought. For example, when I make broth, I no longer heat it on the stove or in the microwave. I just hit the boil function on this and pour into my cup.

A representative responded to me and asked for the date I purchased my kettle, product serial number, and my mailing address. I responded. Two days later, I received another email asking me to send them my original receipt. I responded accordingly. Today I received a third email from Cuisinart that explains my kettle's manufacturer's warranty lasts only for 3 years and is expired, but that I am within a 6-month grace period. If I'd like, I can mail my kettle to an address they will provide to me at my own expense. This is all well and good, but I'm very frustrated that it took three email to tell me that I have no recourse for my suddenly broken kettle. Again, I've had enough of small appliances made with substandard materials that cost more money than they're worth. I'll be going back to basics with food preparation and will support any decent, consumer-friendly company that will manufacture a simple tea kettle or coffee maker with quality stainless steel and quality components. I hope more consumers will do the same. I'm sorry to say it, but products made in China are not made well nor are they made to last. Consumers have the ability to take a stand against poorly made products with their voices and their wallets.\n\n* Update 7/11/19: This is a review of my third kettle. My first experience in 2011 was so good, I just had to try again. This kettle worked flawlessly for three years. Then suddenly and unexpectedly, the base went out and the kettle is now useless. Three years is not long enough for an $80 kettle to last, in my opinion. I'm moving on from Cuisinart.\n\n2016: I actually purchased two of these kettles, the first in the fall of 2010 and the second, one year later. The first kettle worked great in every aspect, and is still working perfectly today in year 2016. No rust ever, but occasional mineral deposits that are easily removed with a vinegar rinse. The second kettle regrettably never worked, not even for a moment. I'm not sure if the kettle itself is faulty or if the problem is in the base. Due to my locale not having access to regular mail (extreme rural Alaska), it was simply too difficult to try to return it. My husband is still optimistic he can do something to make it work. If nothing else, perhaps the working part can be switched out with the first kettle when it finally fizzles out, whenever that is. So I have a mixed opinion: one kettle rates 5 stars while the other rates 0 stars. I'll be generous and give a mean review of 3 stars for the two. I'm interested in buying a new kettle to use while visiting family during a lengthy stay, but am concerned whether I'll receive a 0 star product or higher. Consistency in quality seems to be an issue, reading through a number of reviews. Here's hoping... By the way, I'm extremely appreciative to those genuine reviewers who are not posting as a result of obtaining their kettle 'with a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased' review.' If this is where Amazon sellers are headed, I'm not biting."},{"reviewerName":"K. Putt","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Lasted less than a month","reviewDate":"February 27, 2014","reviewText":"Most of my kitchen is made up of Cuisinart products. They've always served me well and lasted a long time. So based on previous experience, I chose Cuisinart when I went looking for a cordless kettle. I noticed immediately that the lid on this kettle seemed to have trouble staying shut, but I brushed that off thinking it was intentionally created that way to keep from too much pressure building up or boiling over... I don't know. Anyway, within less than three weeks, the lid now will not shut at all. The \"open\" button (which is the button that releases the lid to open) is compressed all the way down, as if it's stuck somehow, and I can't get the lid to close. There's no parts missing, nothing broken, nothing chipped. It simply won't stay shut. I can still make tea/boil water in the kettle, but I need to put something heavy on the lid to keep it closed. That's not a solution for a product that I paid nearly $100 for! Plenty of lower priced kettles that have good reviews. I'm careful with my electronics, and I don't abuse my products. This is clearly a defect in the manufacturing, and that is something I find very disappointing for a brand such as Cuisinart. I will give them a call to see if there is something they can do for me, but from all I've been reading online, Cuisinart seems to have a poor reputation for replacing parts, such as this lid that isn't working anymore.

I like to make my own Tazo Iced Tea which required you boil water and add to a specially designed pitcher. It used to be a tedious task having to boil \"pots\" of water (very timely) and try ever so carefully to not spill while transitioning to the pitcher. With this kettle I need to boil about 2 1/2 full and in under 5 minutes have my pitcher full ready to go! Love having the quick ability to boil a quick tea while running out of the house in the morning! Another nice feature is there is small filter that is removable located in the \"pourer\".

So, this one, we had for few days, and this is what I have to say:\n1) do not just rinse it before use as they recommend; boil it full and empty, few times, to make sure all the smell disappears\n2) maybe it makes sense to finish the buttons with resin or some sort of sealer as the marks are going to erase soon (they did on our last one so I just printed “a cheat sheet” and kept it near (after being tired of writing them on with a sharpie only to watch them to dissolve again )))\n3) it’s great that it has a 160F option. When we were researching, that was one of the factors as my daughter only uses this temperature\n4) the light is definitely brighter on this one so it’s easier to see how much water is in it, especially considering that the scale is so conveniently located behind “in the armpit” ;)))))\n5) the ready signal is definitely louder than it was in the previous model. They probably think that people only make tea when there is a loud party; or only old people with hearing impairments do that. It sounds a little like alarm clock so I’m going to ask my handy husband if he can adjust it so kids don’t wake up when the kettle is on in the middle of the night!\n6) the “bump” on the base where you are supposed to position the kettle on, is taller and leaner than previous one, - too bad bc I was hoping to use both bases with one kettle (one for the basement), it’s easier to just carry the kettle rather than disconnect the base and connect it again , and so forth\n\nOverall, happy with purchase.

I use it mostly for french press coffee, but my guests have used it for various kinds of tea, instant oatmeal, or hot chocolate with great success.\n\nI did a lot of research on these kettles, and I found that the one thing to avoid was kettles with plastic insides. Every single one with plastic innards had comments about plastic taste in the water. Stainless and glass interiors didn't have this problem, but glass was more susceptable to scale buildup. So I went with stainless. There aren't many of these kettles with stainless insides, and the ones there are are generally more expensive. I looked at the Breville and some others, but they were simply too much money. This one, while not cheap, offered a great feature set, accurate temperatures, stainless interior, good controls, unobstrusive base, and pretty nice aesthetics.\n\nThe kettle is easy to fill, solidly built, and heats water very fast. It finishes its heat cycle with an authoritative BEEP that I can hear from the next room as I watch Sports Center. Another bonus is that even once it has reached temperature, it will keep the water at that temperature for up to 30 minutes, so if I'm busy doing something else, my kettle can wait until I get there, and my water isn't too cold or too hot! The most important thing about a good cup of french press coffee, besides the beans, is the temperature of the water.\n\nThe base is very minimal and you don't even notice it when the kettle is sitting on it, it looks like one piece of the kettle. The controls are easy to reach while holding the kettle by the handle, and the little LED light on the water level indicator is bright and helps you see the water level in a dimly lit early morning kitchen. It also automatically shuts off after a bit if the kettle heat has been turned off. The kettle will turn off automatically after a certain amount of time, but it also is easy to turn off once you've poured out your needed water by pressing the \"keep warm\" button again.\n\nCleaning is as easy as making a water/white vinegar mixture and letting the kettle boil for 10-15 minutes, then rinsing it out a few times. This removes lime scale deposits and calcification.\n\nFor the build quality, looks, features, and performance, I can't rate this kettle high enough!

I have a lot of Cuisinart items in my kitchen. This teakettle has been used at least once and up to three times a day for the past three years.\n\nRecently, its brain has started to become scrambled. Sometimes, after it boils water, it fails to stop boiling and just keeps going and going until I manually turn it off. Sometimes all the lights blink on and off rapidly and I have to unplug the whole thing to reboot. Often the keep warm function doesn't work, and I love that function as I can't always get to the kettle to pour as soon as it boils.

I almost did not purchase this item due to many reviews discussing the unit failing prematurely, rusting, problems with the buttons, noise, etc. While obviously to early to evaluate rusting or failure, I can comment on the other areas of this item.\n\nMany reviews cite the loud beep of the buttons to be an issue. They have either lowered the volume due to these complaints, or folks have people sleeping with beds in the floor next to the unit. This unit is in my kitchen and when a button is pressed it does beep, however, the noise is hardly audible enough to be heard in the next room. The beep is slightly louder it seems to alert when your water temperature has been reached, but this is a feature I find valuable.\n\nI have tested the preset water temperatures of the unit by inserting a digital thermometer and checking the temp right after the unit has turned off at each setting. The unit was lower than each setting by an average of 1 degree, which is certainly within margin of error and could well be due to my thermometer.\n\nThe item is well made and looks good on your counter, however, know that the exterior does water spot if splashed, so keep that in mind. Thusfar, very happy with this item and I will update the review if any other negatives pop up during my ownership."},{"reviewerName":"Kestrel","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Versatile and lovely water kettle","reviewDate":"April 18, 2017","reviewText":"I don't use this daily, I bought it for a cabin that we occasionally go to. Some users were not impressed by things that failed with frequent use, so I felt confident this would work for me longterm, and I feel like it will. Have used it several times, and it has been great. I can hear the beeps when it is ready, but it is not loud. The keep-warm function is an added bonus that few other pots had, and also love the temp selection, since we drink the gamut from french press coffee to every single tea listed on the buttons--it IS true that you do well to match the water temp to the tea so not to have bitter tea.

I've been using it for a few weeks now and it's amazing. An old roommate had the breville variable temp, and if you can AFFORD it then I highly recommend that instead.\nI went for the Cuisinart because of the bang for your buck. It's just as fast and beautiful as the breville: it works like a dream!\nThere are few differences in the machines especially in my opinion, and I saved $60! dollars going with the Cuisinart (I bought mine for $70). The breville is also SLIGHTLY larger, but having one before, it's not that inconvenient to just boil more water if you really need more. Besides, both kettles are so fast! The inconveniences that I think are worth saving $60 whole dollars on are: the opening to pour water into the machine is smaller, I anticipate the buttons rubbing off eventually (so says previous reviews), and the place where you can see the water level is just mildly inconvenient, but after a while that doesn't even bother me. Actually, what may bother some people more is that the cord is so small, so plan to put this appliance right next to the outlet (not at all a problem for me).\n\nOver all, love the Cuisinart water boiler.

A+++","reviewDate":"March 8, 2016","reviewText":"The Cuisinart CPK-17 PerfecTemp 1.7-Liter Stainless Steel Cordless Electric Kettle is a very good buy. It is probably the best cordless electric kettle out there. It has the feature of boiling to different temperatures for the different types of tea you will be consuming. It is a very good size. It sits on the counter nicely, and it has a very nice stainless steel look. It is easy to operate, and it can re-heat to keep the water at the desired temperature. It also has a boil-dry feature as well. The blue back-color is very pleasant.\n\nThere is a small slide mesh filter that easily comes out that you can clean.\n\nPour our the excess water when not in use and let your kettle air-day.\n\nThe bottom heating unit can start to discolor due to calcium deposits from the water. Depending on your water source, you may need to clean more often.\n\nYou can clean and de-scale the inside of the kettle with water and white vinegar or with water with baking soda and or lemon juice and set it to boil. I've boiled just white vinegar itself for a more potent cleaner, and it works fine.\n\nI have read that some other people having issues with the lid mechanism rusting, but I have not had that issue myself. Others have had the bottom heating unit start spotting with rust. I've only had calcium deposit spotting and was able to clean it with vinegar boil and with a long sponge brush.\n\nOther stainless steel kettles rust inside as well especially regular stove kettles, but people can't see it or know it if they are not able to see the inside clearly enough on them\n\nI recommend the Cuisinart CPK-17 PerfecTemp electric kettle. It has worked well for me, and I think it has made my tea drinking experience better with the temperature controls for the different types of tea being consumed. The price is a little pricey for a tea kettle, but the features are nice to have. The kettle is very solid, and it looks great in the kitchen.

It has a set of temperature buttons that allow you to control the water temp simply by pushing the corresponding button. For example, Cuisinart says black tea should be steeped at 212 deg F, while green teas should be steeped at a lower temperature. I suppose my palate is simply incapable of telling the difference, or could it be that the water cools while being transferred to the pot/cup? However, what I did want was the feature that keeps the water at the set temperature, thus allowing one to make tea with no wait (once the desired temp has been reached). Unfortunately, Cuisinart decided that you must make that tea within 30 minutes! After that, the kettle turns itself off again.

I have been considering this product for a few years. The cost was a bit of a barrier but also I had one of those 5-gallon water coolers with the typical hot water option. That is what I used for years and before that I pretty much just heated water up in the microwave. Yes. Sad but true. Recently we moved and downsized and with that move we lost the space for the nifty 5-gallon water cooler. So, I was back to heating water in the microwave. Anyway, I finally broke down and purchased this item. And let me just say; W-O-W. This is perfect in many ways; easy to use, heats up fast, temperature is perfect, great safety features, very attractive appliance, takes up little space, perfect size, etc. All this translates to my absolute love for this product but also the proverbial regret of why did I not but this sooner? Also, I must say, I have been drinking tea at the wrong temperatures ALL my life!!! Honestly! What a wake up call. My first cup of green tea at the appropriate temperature in this Cuisinart was an a-ha moment for me! Previously, I had been heating my water to nearly boiling and just flat out ruining the delicate notes of my green tea! What a shame. And here all this time I just thought it was bad tea and eventually got accustomed to drinking bad tea! So, to say I am happy is an understatement. I am so glad I finally fronted up the money to buy this. If you appreciate a perfect cup of tea-look no further. Note: I am a big coffee drinker too but I have not used this Cuisinart for that yet.

I drink tea every day and love that the CPK-17 has different temperature settings based on the type of tea I am in the mood for. I think it might be a little bit overpriced but that is difficult to judge right now. If it lasts for 10 years, it a good price. If it lasts for one year, well then it is a terrible price. I'll add to my review once I've had it for some time. But honestly, it seems very well built and I've purchased Cuisinart products in the past and still have them many years later.\n\nUPDATE (Oct 25, 2018): Had troubles after 6 months with the first unit and struggled with Cuisinart to get it returned without having to pay for shipping both ways!!!! The second unit worked relatively well but I would have trouble setting the controls sometimes and would have to unplug it once a month to get it to work again. It got worse in the end and I had to unplug it at least once a day! It finally died the other day forcing it into the appliance junkyard:(\n\nI decided to buy a completely different brand this time and went with Homgeek electric kettle which looks identical to the Epica electric kettle. Why do I mention this here. First, because I have just boxed it up after two days of service. And second, Amazon wouldn't let me review it on it's item page! This unit has the same six temperature settings as the Cuisinart but the difference is, each time you turn it on you must hit the Set button and cycle through the temps to get to the one you want. It defaults to 212 degrees! That's fine if 99% of the time you only use that setting but I'll bet most people that buy a multi-temp kettle would probably find that annoying! I usually use 200 degrees so I had to hit the Set button multiple times each time I wanted a cup of tea. I drink at least six cups a day so that got old fast! The other issue is it didn't keep the water hot after it's cycle... you had to hit another button after you started it in order to use the Keep Warm feature. Again, every time you used the kettle. The lid opener is built into the lid and was quite small (annoying) and also the lid came up at a small angle making it a bit more difficult to fill. The last issue is that it didn't beep when the cycle finished. I guess that was something I got used to with the Cuisinart.\n\nI have now replaced my Kettle with the Hamilton Beach 41020 Electric Kettle. It looks identical to the Cuisinart and I'm guessing if I went to China I would find them being made together in the same factory on parallel assembly lines.

So basically they took my money and left me with nothing. 4 stars for the kettle, -4 for malevolent customer service then +2 just to keep this out of the hater category of 1 star.\n\nLong version: I was impressed with this kettle when visiting my brother so I bought my own. Simple to use, well marked temperatures and tea types. Looks nice. It worked as expected for a couple months then stopped working. No indicators of declining function, just wouldn't heat anymore one day. I called Cuisinart and followed their instruction about cleaning the unit in case a temperature sensor was blocked, but no result. Sent it back to Cuisinart and didn't hear anything for months. Almost a year, actually, which is when I called them to see what was up. As with probably most other busy people out there, an automatic tea kettle is not my top priority, especially when it's just a convenience over the standard tea kettle that is still on my stovetop. In any case, I was told that a \"referral to corporate\" was being made and that I would get a call back in a couple days. No call. Now, three months later and no returned calls and I called them today and was told that it's now past the warranty period and because I didn't call within a month from the original claim, they don't consider it their problem so they are not willing to do anything for me. Keep in mind that the kettle supposedly carries a three year warranty so one might think this is still under the warranty period. Also, when I called three months ago- under the \"one year\" they keep claiming is preventing them from taking action- the customer service rep said nothing about their expected protocol from customers or about a kettle which they now claim was sent to me via USPS with no delivery confirmation. This last claim was made by a customer service supervisor moments before ending the call and was not mentioned in any previous interactions with them, an action which gives me no confidence that they are telling the truth. Now they say the best they can do for me is give me an address for their corporate office to which to lodge a complaint, though given their tactic of doing nothing until the problem (ie customer) goes away, I have no faith that my letter will produce any results.

I purchased this because I like Pu-Erh and Green Teas. Both need to have water at specific temperatures to brew the best tea. I have made several kettles of water at different temps and so far so good. I do like the lit water level indicator and the keep warm setting. Two features my Breville water kettle didnt have. I am keeping my old water kettle because I love the look (blue and white ceramic) and I can take it with me when I travel or send it to college with one of my children. I know everyone seems to love stainless steel but it would be nice if Cusinart made a a ceramic or a colored water kettle option. I will be curious to see if the words on the buttons wear off over time like some reviewers have mentioned. I decided its not that big of a deal if it happens because I have had the same problem with a computer keyboard and my a/c control in my car. Seems like lettering on a black background is prone to wearing off, I have just purchased a set of keyboard stickers and trimmed them to meet my needs.

In the past, I've heated water for my tea either in the microwave or on the stove top, usually to boiling since it's hard to be precise with that method. This kettle heats up to 1.7L of water to a set temp and it does so pretty quickly - faster than the microwave surprisingly. For example, 1.5L will heat to 200 degrees within 4 minutes. I like the lighted display and the interior light that allows you to easily see how much water is in the kettle. And since various teas taste best brewed at a fairly specific temp, this kettle allows you to accurately control that. Green teas at 175, blacks at 200 or boiling, etc. I have a cooking thermometer, and I checked 3 different setting (175, 185, 200 degrees) and it was within a degree or two of each setting. Certainly close enough, and since my thermometer isn't calibrated, it could well be the kettle is spot on.\n\nI love this cordless feature as well - only the base has the cord and the kettle lifts off the base so you can take it to another room if you want to. And in any case, its far better than having a cord in the way when pouring the water. It also will keep the water at the set temp for up to 30 minutes before automatically shutting off. Nice. It's also totally stainless steel and has a mesh filter in the spout which can be cleaned. No replacement will be necessary. It also beeps, although not loudly, when the set water temp is reached, but I can hear it in the next room. I'm very pleased with this kettle."},{"reviewerName":"A.

After getting up to temperature, I lifted the kettle off the stand and was left with a pool of hot water around the stand.

It’ll heat 1.75 liters from 68°F to boiling in just over 7 minutes but I seldom heat that much. The minimum level is 0.5 liters. The tone that signals completion is mild, not obnoxious.

There is no way to tell how hot the water is as it heats. You must wait for a full cycle to complete before you know the temp.

I tend to trust these guys given their extensive and thoughtful tests, and so I bought their pick although it's not cheap.\n\nI'm a great tea lover, and I drink different kind of teas (mostly greens, but also black, oolong, white, herbal infusions) 2+ time a day.\nIn the morning both me and my husband have tea at breakfast, but since we drink different teas which requires different temperatures, we heat the water separately. In the fall/winter I am sure to have a huge pot of tea in the afternoon, and usually we also have herbal teas in the evening.\nSo in a year we used the kettle pretty extensively, and it still works great!\n\nThese are the main reason why I like it:\n1) it heats up to 1.7 liter of water, so if I want to fill a big teapot or I have guest I can heat enough water for everyone\n2) you can choose among 6 different temperatures for different kind of teas (which makes a huge difference!), and the labels are pretty accurate (I've measured the water both in mug and in a teapot a couple of times, out of curiosity, and there were +/- 2 F degrees difference tops)\n3) it's quick and noiseless - yes, you'll hear the water boiling, but that's it, it won't make any additional noise\n4) given its large capacity, it doesn't take a lot of space on the countertop, plus it has a nice design and I don't mind have it around\n5) it's easy to fill (I love the button to open the lid automatically), and to check how much water you poured in\n6) the 30 minute keep warm option (although I don't use it that much)\n\nAs everything, it has a couple of downside:\n1) it's heavy! especially if filled to its top capacity\n2) the sides get hot, so pay attention not to touch them\n\nBPA controversy: this kettle has minor plastic components, and I was concerned.

It heated up quick and was the right temperature, gave me a nice gentle steeping. Second run was oolong at 190, also hit the spot, very happy with the results.\n\nI deducted 1-star for the afore-mentioned issue with tea-steeping temperature suggestions and, more importantly, b/c it is basically impossible to see the water level unless the backlighting has come on (when in operation the buttons & water gauge glow blue). Not a huge deal but slightly annoying and I have used less fancy tea kettles where you can always see the water level. I have to check, pretty sure there is no floating bauble so you need the backlighting to see where the water rises to. Ok, still really happy with it and would suggest it.\n\nI chose this over the 1-L Bonavita Gooseneck Variable Temperature Kettle, figured that having the capacity needed for guests outweighed the pour control of the gooseneck spout. The Bonavita also allows for more temperature customization but the presets on the Cuisinart are sufficient for me, and I am quite particular about water temp so that is saying something.

Only wish it was came in a 2 liter model as I typically make 2 quarts of ice tea at a time.\n\nOnly 1 very slight design flaw... when pouring the last cup from the kettle, the water comes from the lip of the spout (where it should) and also from the upper edge of the hole in the kettle where the spout is located. It all goes in the cup, so no problem. But if I were working on the next improved model, there are a couple easy ways to fix this... lower the top edge of the spout hole or put a baffle inside the unit to prevent water from getting to the top of the unit when tipped to get the last cup.\n\nJune 2017 edit: My initial review was 5 stars. I've lowered it to 4. I was going to lower it to 3, as I was having an issue with my new one, but I begrudgingly give it a 4 as the problem seems to be getting better with time.\n\nSo, I'm on my 2nd CPK-17 now. My first CPK-17 developed a leak at the bottom of the handle. And, leaving it filled overnight resulted in a small puddle of water below the base in the morning. I really liked my first kettle, so I purchased another. Unfortunately, I'm having a problem that others have mentioned in having difficulty opening the lid. While my 1st kettle only rarely did not open on the 1st press, it always opened on the 2nd. My new kettle has not been as cooperative. And *one* time I had to SHAKE it while half full about 10 times while holding the button, before the lid finally popped open. I've only had this new one a couple weeks now and, so far, that has only happened once, but it frequently takes more that one press of the button before the lid will open. This problem is improving with use so I'm hoping the lid will loosen up further over time.\n\n2nd edit: So it's been over a week now since my previous edit and it looks like the lid has loosened.

I did some research on different types of kettles and decided to purchase this one. Here's what I found so far.\n\nThe look:\nI really like the look except for the fact that the window is hard to see so when pouring water into the kettle, you actually have to be very close to the window. This morning I had hard time even seeing the amount of water because the window was all steamy. Even though we haven't used it over night. They should definitely consider moving the window to a side.\n\nThe feel:\nThis kettle is made of metal and feels a little heavy. After a few minutes of pushing the \"start\" button, it gets real hot and makes it impossible to touch (even the lid), but the handle stays cool.\n\nThe functionality:\nWhen I plugged in the kettle to the outlet and put it on base, the blue light in the window turned on and stayed on for about 10 minutes. There's no way to turn it off other than to take the kettle out of its base. I guess the light is useful if you want to see how much water you have in the kettle, but it is only useful when the kettle is on the base. I poured water all the way to the max, set it to \"boil\" and started the process. The buttons are not easy to press, sometimes it takes me a few times before it responds so I have to push the buttons harder. In a software age where gadgets like touch screens make it so easy to touch and expect an immediate response, I'd say this is a big flaw in the kettle. It took about 7.5 minutes to boil water at which point the kettle beeped softly three times and stopped working while the temperature \"boil\" and \"start\" buttons started blinking. If I was in the next room, I wouldn't be able to hear the beeps. I poured a cup of water out into my cup and pushed \"keep warm\" button a few times until it was lit. About a minute later it turned off so I wasn't sure if it was still working so I pushed it again a couple of times so the button lit and then it turned off again. I poured all water out and wanted to test \"boil-dry protection\" feature. It took maybe half a minute for the kettle to realize there's no water inside and it shut off and all the buttons started blinking. I took it off its base and put it back on hoping it would reset, but it didn't. I started pressing \"start\" button (according to the manual, pressing \"start\" will either start or stop the boiling process), but it didn't help. So I took the kettle of its base and left it on the table for about 10 minutes after which point I put it back on the base and it magically reset. I guess the two minute memory feature prevented the kettle from being reset.\n\nOverall, I would say it's a safe to use kettle if you don't touch it while it's hot. It definitely boils water fast and signals when it's done."},{"reviewerName":"Jonathan","rating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Works fine...unless it doesn't this time and you come back to cold water in 5 minutes.","reviewDate":"April 5, 2014","reviewText":"This is a pretty nice kettle in that it has 6 pre-set temperatures that pretty consistently get water to the same temperature.\n\nIt feels pretty nice, but overall quality is kind of dubious--the steel top pops off its plastic lid pretty easily, the lettering for all the buttons wore off in less than a year, and, well, it frequently just doesn't heat the water.\n\nWhat happens is you press the \"Start\" button and the kettle will just sit for half a minute and then emit 3 beeps and turn off.\nIt does this just frequently enough that I don't ever trust it to actually start, and usually stand over it to make sure it is actually going to work this time, which kind of ruins part of the point of being able to select a temperature and come back to hot water.\nIt has done this since new.\n\nI also wish the temperatures were just a little different, but, with so many other things wrong with it, I won't press my luck.\nI will probably keep it until it breaks (probably soon, as has been my experience with other Cuisinart products), and hope something better is on the market by then."},{"reviewerName":"L.

I do have to say though, that even when the kettle worked, I wished that the spout had a lid, 'cause the spout's pretty sizeable, and I can imagine a lot of dust settling into the kettle. Plus, my sister once found a boiled ant in her cup. Apparently it had crawled into the spout at some point...\n\nAnyway, I drink various different teas and coffee everyday, so the preset temperatures were a huge convenience.\n\nUnfortunately after a lot of research, it seems apparent that the biggest weakness of electric kettles, is that they just don't last that long before something blows out.\n\nI really enjoyed the preset temperatures, so I'd love to buy another electric kettle with those features, albeit one that'll last longer than a year... but in this day and age, there aren't many options. At least on Amazon, it's either this kettle or the one by Breville, but it appears that even the latter suffers from a short lifespan.\n\nSucks, but I might have to return to conventional stovetop kettles, until one of these companies can figure out something with more durability, 'cause shelling out $80-120 for one of these is not worth it if it can't last more than a year. Maybe $30, tops.\n\nStovetop kettles practically last forever. I might invest in one with a thermometer on it, although it's kinda tedious constantly checking the temperature to make sure it's on the money... since there isn't any shutoff feature or alerts, like the electric kettles.

As others have said, the only fix Cuisinart has is to send you a new one for free, but you must pay shipping both ways for a total of at least $30. These are the terms of their \"limited\" warranty.\n\nI asked the Cuisinart rep. what the history of this problem is. She said there is no history of this complaint and no recall. So I said \"Do you mean that no one has reported this problem to Cuisinart in the history of this product?\" and she replied \"that's right.\" That's an absolute lie, as evidenced by many other 1-star reviews complaining of the exact same problem.\n\nIt's back to the old-fashioned on-the-stove kettle for me. I thought Cuisinart was a reputable brand, but it is not. They make a $90 kettle and you have to pay to replace the product when you report a common and known problem.

With this kettle the temperature is perfect, and green tea tastes great. I combine heated water and loose tea in my Bodum French Press (which is supposed to be for coffee) and brew a perfect pot each time.The footprint is only 6\"., The finish is elegant enough to sit out on the counter full time. The coffee drinkers in the family appreciate it as well with the boiling water option as well as french press temp. Heating is very fast. The pour spout seldom drips. Seeing the water level is helpful. It measures liters- I do wish it was cups.

That was a deal breaker. I discovered this here and bought it hoping it would fit the bill.\n\nI absolutely love this device! It rocks!

The pot simply lifts off without any hassle or latch to work. There's a single connection point or whatever it is that the pot sits down onto. Seriously, it's super sleek, simple and well designed.\n\nAs for heating, this baby gets rocking very quickly. I have me 200 degree water in just a few minutes. It beeps to let me know when it's ready.\n\nMy only complaint ... and it's not really a complaint ... is that it's too big for our needs.

Yes, it boils water, though it does it well and you get a great cup of tea/joe.

Result, a really great cup of coffee or tea.\n\nIs it worth four times the price of a cheap box store kettle?

I am an avid tea drinker and especially enjoy loose tea and matcha. This tea kettle has been incredible for both. For green tea I usually use the delicate setting, as I prefer my water a little cooler than the kettle suggests for green (160 instead of 180). That may be because I usually drink jasmine pearl green tea, which I feel is a little more delicate in flavor than most green teas. For other green teas I use the usual green tea setting. For herbal teas I use the boil setting and they always come out wonderful. Matcha is the only tricky one. Its recommend that you use water at 80 degrees for this type of tea and the kettle does not have this setting. I drank a couple bitter tasting cups before I figured out a solution. Now what I do is I add a little bit of cold water (about 1/4-1/3 of the water I want) to my matcha powder and mix well. Then I add the hot water from the delicate setting. Makes perfect matcha every time and actually makes mixing it significantly easier.\n\nTea is a ritual for me and this kettle has made the experience so much more enjoyable. No more microwaving water or boiling it on the stove leaving me to guess if it is the correct temp. This machine is quick and looks beautiful on my counter. Some reviewers complained about the noise, but it really isn't bothersome. It sounds just like boiling water and I actually find it sort of soothing.

I use it every single day to make tea in the morning, and occasionally in the afternoons as well. It heats quickly, is relatively quiet (a bit noisy when getting up to a boil, but the noise doesn't last long). The little beeping at the end is nice, not too loud.\n\nI originally wanted the pricey tea maker from Breville, because I liked the idea of setting the tea maker just like a coffee maker and having the tea ready to go in the morning. However, I usually only drink one cup of tea in the morning, and it seemed a bit too expensive for my one cup. I decided I could live with pouring the water over my own tea and brewing it that way. I've been very happy with my decision.\n\nOne of the best features is the \"Keep Warm\" function. I like this because I don't have to go running the second I hear the \"I'm done\" beep, the way I used to have to run to the kitchen to calm down the shrieking stovetop kettle. If I don't hear the beep, or just can't get there right away, no problem! The kettle will periodically reheat to keep the temperature up. For multiple cups of tea, however, I don't use the \"Keep Warm\" function. I just shut off the kettle and then get it going again when/if I want a second cup of tea. It reheats so quickly that I don't bother keeping it warm and listening to the reboil over and over.\n\nI haven't done any testing of the temperatures to see how accurate they are, but all of my different types of tea taste great when brewed at the preset temperatures. Unlike some previous reviewers, I have not had any issues with the words wearing off the preset buttons. The kettle still looks brand new, nothing fading or peeling after about a year now of daily use.\n\nBuy it, you won't regret it!"},{"reviewerName":"Mark","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Over all I am happy with this product and would recommend it F","reviewDate":"June 4, 2015","reviewText":"I have been trying different loose leaf teas (green, black and oolong) and discovered that the brewing temperature really does matter.

A lot of the times the temperature is not right, especially when you select boil. The water clearly isn't boiling, but the beep go's off and the kettle shuts off. For other temperature settings I've taken a meat thermometer to check he temp and it's usually way off. Either too hot, or not hot enough. This became extremely frustrating and I took this kettle to work, and brought the old Black&Decker kettle back home, since I tend to make tea more at home.

I just have to remember to hit the second button after \"on\" to choose my temperature. I've had a number of electric kettles over the years--sometimes they give up the ghost so this may be my third one--and I don't want plastic so I did get rid of a perfectly good one that was not BPOA-free, sad to say.

It's sleek-looking and the button presets are excellent. It's certainly not like the Breville One-Touch in the way of efficiency, but I certainly love the Keep Warm, which you can shut off and on, along with other benefits. I previously used (and still have as backup) the Aroma kettle, which was pretty decent and reliable for the price, but lacked the ability to control the temperature. It was always too hot.\n\nWhile this kettle provides those wants and more, I have to say that, during the times I've checked the temp immediately after it's beeped \"ready\", it hasn't always been at the temperature of the present selected, but rather well under. My thermometer is pretty consistent and professional-grade, so I don't think that is an issue, but it could be my particular kettle or other factors, and I'm waiting to purchase a better thermo later to confirm the issue. For now, it's not a big deal; I just set it a little higher for my delicate teas to reach 175, 180, etc., and have since gotten it down pretty well. It also brews slower than the Aroma I had. I do love the delicate beep (I hate beeping lol), but could see some people complaining about it being too quiet in loud households, and I also appreciate the light that makes it easier to see how much water you have.\n\nWith that said, while I love the kettle, I'm not sure I would repurchase it again at just around one hundred dollars, should this be an all-around or ongoing issue with the kettle and not just my own. I just don't feel it's worth it in that price range, though perhaps a bit lower. I tend to find it a little overpriced as it is, but it is a great piece otherwise and I love at least being able to have it stop at a certain point, even if it's not completely accurate, sometimes being off by 10 degrees or more.

Initially, I was delighted with it. I've had it about a year, and can now tell you what's wrong with it.\n\nThe first issue that I had does not apply to many people. I live at 8,300' ASL, so water boils at a lower temperature. If you set the kettle to \"Boil\", it will not turn off at high altitude. It will finally shut off when the water level gets low, so it's not the end of the world. A minor issue, specific to a tiny fraction of customers.\n\nThe big problem with this kettle is the construction. There is something about the seam at the bottom that does not take the heat cycle well. The kettle can sit cold, for days, and will not leak. If I fill it, and turn it on, after it comes to a boil there will be a half dozen drops of water between the base and the kettle. That would not be a big deal, except that the kettle has circuits that worry about water being where it does not belong. Ten minutes after you turn it off, it will start beeping and flashing and misbehaving, to warn you that there is water where it should not be. It's annoying.

Riley","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"A perfect wedding gift for tea-lovers","reviewDate":"November 1, 2011","reviewText":"My son recently married a young woman from Japan and I included this kettle in the assortment of kitchen gifts that I chose for them. Like many Japanese people that I have known, Kanako is used to having green tea readily available both for herself and to offer to guests. My son perefers black tea as well as French pressed coffee. When I discovered this item I was very excited to see if it works as advertised. They liked their's so much that I purchased one for myself. Here is my take on it:\n\nLike many other Cuisinart products, this one is fairlly attractive. The controls are very intuitive and exceptionally well defined. The proper temperature for several different beverages are printed on the handle right next to the button that brings the water to that level of heat. I don't know if tea experts would agree with these parameters but it seems to work well for me. My only complaint is that the \"beep\" that alerts you as to when the water is at preset temperature is pretty quiet. I really have to strain in order to hear it. Other than that I am very happy wifh this product. My new daughter-in-law told me that it is perfect, but she is well known for being extremely polite. :-). However,I think that she too is happy with this cordless kettle.\n\nWe have hard water is this part of the country and it causes a lot of problems with products like this. I use filtered water in my kettle and I have not had a problem with scaling in the many months that I have been using mine. So far this product delivers all that I could hope for in a cordless kettle."},{"reviewerName":"Smoky Blue","rating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Previous 5-star product now 2-star","reviewDate":"April 2, 2011","reviewText":"*** UPDATE ***\nMy original review of the Cuisinart CPK-17 purchased in 2011 can be found below this updated review:\n\nRecently the CPK-17 purchased in 2011 stopped working when I accidentally splash water on the handle control . We've loved the product and immediately bought a new one. The current product on the market is rather inferior to the one I reviewed originally.\n\n* Boiling water is 30% slower. The 2011 CPK-17 brought 1L of water to 212°F in 4m 30s, the current one does it in 5m 50s under similar ambient temperatures and starting water temperatures.\n* The newer model has black lettering in the water window instead of white, which is more difficult to read.\n* The water window itself is more difficult to use. It often has condensation inside the window that makes it difficult to gauge the water level.\n\nIf you've never used the earlier model, there is still plenty to like in the CPK-17, but if you have you are likely to be somewhat disappointed.\n\n*** ORIGINAL REVIEW ***\nMy fiance were originally considering buying a Japanese style water boiler like this one Zojirushi CD-LCC40 Micom 4.0-Liter Electric Dispensing Pot, but changed our minds when we couldn't find one that had a metal interior -- most are plastic -- nor one that could be set to go directly to the desired temperature without boiling first. I'm glad we decided on the CPK-17, because it is a great kettle and perfect for our needs. We drink a lot of tea, so it's nice to be able to set the temperature for delicate tea, green tea, white tea, oolong tea, french press coffee, or black tea.\n\nAs I mentioned before, the kettle will not boil the water first and wait for it to cool down to the correct temperature like all of the Japanese dispensers I've seen. This is important to me, because it can take quite a while for 1.7L of water too cool from boiling -- 212°F -- to the correct temperature for green tea -- 175°F. In addition, there are no plastic parts that touch the water, so there isn't any off-taste you can sometimes get with kettles with plastic interiors.\n\nI use this kettle all day long, almost every day, and have had no issues with it. It's well-built and looks great in our kitchen.\n\nFor those interested in heating times, here are some quick measurements I took to heat water coming from the refrigerator dispenser which is approximately 50°F at sea level in a 75°F environment:\n\n0.75L to 175°F : 3m 5s\n1.00L to 212°F : 4m 30s\n1.70L to 212°F : 7m 55s"},{"reviewerName":"Terry Tran","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"This Cuisinart electric kettle is not stainless steel as it claimed it was.","reviewDate":"May 16, 2019","reviewText":"We dislike this product after using three months because it started rusting interior/exterior.

I am an avid tea drinker, and I drink tea from leaves, not tea bags, so to be able to change the temperature is wonderful. It's as simple as pushing the right button, and off it goes. I've always wanted to make my tea with the water temperature that the tea containers mention, and with this kettle, it's easy.\n\nThe water boils fairly fast, but one thing I did notice is that it is pretty loud. Maybe it's just me, but when I have this on in the kitchen boiling water, I can hear the bubbling in the living room. I live in a 2BR apartment, but it shouldn't be so loud that it bothers me! Other than that, I have no complaints. It's very user friendly, and I love that it is cordless - it makes it very easy to fill up.\n\nI've been using it for 8 months now, and it's going strong.

It has always been consistent in temperature and can reach a boil surprisingly quickly. Before I had this, I would boil water on the stove like a barbarian. After having this kettle for almost a year, I don't think I could go back to the stove or even a lesser model. It makes mornings easy because I don't need to babysit it.

High capacity, sleek, multiple temperatures, beep when it is ready? Great! I got a year and a half out of my first kettle before it just stopped heating water. It did that at pretty awful timing, and I was a mess. I needed tea and it failed me. Warranty replaced the kettle (at a $30 processing fee!!), and I got a new one. The new one worked functionally, although the lid mechanism was slightly broken. I suspect it was a refurbished one that had been previously returned. Nonetheless, it heated my water and I was happy. It lasted 9 months, and now it too has failed. It doesn't heat water. Hit the buttons, it lights up, nothing happens, then it gives 3 beeps before giving up.\n\nFor $100 (+$30), I want a product that is going to last a damn long time.

So far everything is excellent. I love the keep warm feature, as I don't often jump right up to get the water when it says the water is ready. I love how the pot itself is wireless so I can take it across the kitchen. My tea and coffee are perfect! No more thermometers to make sure the water is the right temperature!\n\nThe only things I don't like are that it's not as quick as I'd like, that's not to say it's not faster than boiling water stove-top or in the microwave, but I've had kettles that heated faster. Also, the outside of the kettle gets very hot, keep things away from it when heating water. The handle is no problem, that's quit cool, so no worries about burning yourself, just make sure there are no other items touching the kettle and that young hands stay away.\n\nGreat kettle for the price!\n\nA few years later and the kettle works as it always has, it’s just the temp labels on the buttons have all but worn off, leaving me to either remember what they are or look up a picture of the kettle. It also left some rust stains on my counter, but that’s partially my fault for not wiping underneath it when fluids are on the counter, HOWEVER, it’s a high traffic kitchen counter... it’s going to get wet, I just wish the base were as rust resistant as the rest of it."},{"reviewerName":"Codger","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Just bought another","reviewDate":"January 5, 2014","reviewText":"Been using this every day - I am retired and my wife and I drink green tea all day.

I bought this kettle because I am a tea drinker and the temperature of the water you use makes a HUGE difference in flavor. For that reason alone, against my husband's wishes, I am keeping this kettle. I will admit that there are some very irritating aspects to this kettle though:\n\n1) As others have said, the water does not pour smoothly out of the spout. I'm not sure why. It makes it seem like something isn't right and hurts the overall feel. You don't have a lot of control over how big the stream is or how smoothly it pours. I've never experienced anything like that before.\n\n2) When you heat to a boil, it boils for quite a while before turning off. I defend it by saying that it must not be up to the right temperature yet even though the water is fiercely bubbling. It will feel like it is boiling too long though. It is enough to make me worry about my cabinets getting so much steam on them - so I try to keep it pulled out and away from my cabinets.\n\nThe adjustable temperature feature is huge for me, so I'm willing to put up with these annoying quirks.

Easily attaches into it electrical base.\n\nCons: Hard to clean, and difficult to fully allow to dry. SInce the lid pops up and is the most narrow part of the item, not a lot of air can get in to dry the product. Even worse, the filter is an awesome feature, but gets in the way of using a cloth to dry it.\nThe heating tray at the bottom actually discolored after only the second use. I don't believe this is a problem as it is similar to a stainless steel pot discoloration, but it is annoying for how much I spent.\n\nConclusion: Worth the money, but the design could be better.

Koelling","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"I like it, but here's why you might not","reviewDate":"February 25, 2011","reviewText":"Overall, I like this. It heats water quickly, provides no-nonsense controls and looks very nice in our kitchen. I'm rating it 5 stars and used it every day for the past month.\n\nStill, reviews are all about discovering those little nitpicks.\n\n- The water gauge is a little finicky, and even if you hold the pitcher straight vertically under the faucet, sometimes the gauge will not fill up and accurately show the water level. A bit of tilt one way or another will force water in there, and then it's accurate but there has been once or twice when I wondered why it wasn't filling up.\n\n- Secondly, the spout doesn't have any sort of cover on it. After walking into the room and finding our cat rubbing himself on/around the spout, we decided that it ought to be covered. Be aware that there IS a filter between the water tank and the spout, and this filter looks high quality and removable for cleaning so none of that dust would actually get into the water. It's just the area which is made for pouring is open to the air, which we don't like. My wife was learning to knit, so she crafted something just the right size to cover the top and keep the dust/cat fur off.\n\nSo that's the full disclosure review, and the positives (listed in other reviews, I'm sure) outweigh the negatives so much that I can't even ding it for a star. But other folks might be more picky than us. It really does heat water quickly, and looks great."},{"reviewerName":"Jason Bennett","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Dead in just one month!","reviewDate":"July 10, 2015","reviewText":"It looked very good out of the box.

I use this kettle on a daily basis. When I make tea, it is really nice to get the water to the exact temperature. I set the temperature of the kettle and then add it to my cup or tea pot and let the tea steep. I have a coffee pot but on mornings I just want one really good cup, I use the French press setting. This kettle is also useful for things outside of drinks. It's great to heat up water for oatmeal. The no drip pour actually works and I've never had a problem with it. The stay warm will keep the pot at the desired temperature for awhile in case you need to make more than one cup of tea.\n\nThere are two minor quirks. The first is if you turn it off, take it off the plate, then put it back on, a blue glow will appear on your last setting. It won't actually heat the water up but the blue glowing light is on for no reason. The other is you want to clean it out when you see buildup. I use 1 part vinegar to 4 parts water and set it to a boil. I pour it out and then fill it with water, boil it again and its good as new."},{"reviewerName":"Ross L Leleux","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Buy This One","reviewDate":"October 6, 2018","reviewText":"I've owned a few different kettles over the years and this is by far the best one.

Although the device is a bit large in height for my taste, the unit is fast, is fully 100% stainless steel on the inside, and even has a series of buttons on the handle that allows you to bring the water to a series of pre-specified temperatures (for white tea, green tea, oolong tea, etc.). The unit also has a nice blue back lighting feature that automatically turns on when you set the kettle on the electrical contact pad (allowing you to easily see how much water is in the pot), and the buttons themselves light up when depressed so you can verify which temperature you have selected.\n\nAs with most stainless steel kettles, be warned that the exterior can become quite hot after a full boil. Use the handle for all your contact, though, and you'll never notice it.\n\nThe balance on the unit is good, although not as good as some of the smaller, more roundish-shaped kettles which have the center of gravity directly below your hand at all times. However, the balance is fine, particularly considering the amount of water you can boil in the unit.\n\nThe kettle does get loud for about 30 seconds during initial warm-up. This is part of the price you pay for a fast boil. For the rest, it is quiet. The beep upon reaching the set temperature is pleasantly smooth to the ears.\n\nTHe kettle is a bit more expensive than others, but I've owned many over the years, and now wish this one had been available before, because I would not hesitated to buy it. Five stars."},{"reviewerName":"JaM70","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Excellent Product!","reviewDate":"January 14, 2017","reviewText":"Since the birth of our twins six months ago, this kettle has been running for a good portion of every day.

It withstood 10 months of running more than half the day (and night) to make hot water to heat bottles and tons of tea.\n\nUpdate: After a thorough scrubbing just to be sure, we found that the old kettle just had gunk in the button panels.

Even though the weight is stated as 1 lb., I found this heavy to lift, particularly with water in it. Now that said, I have a right shoulder rotator cuff injury so I've lost some muscle power in that arm temporarily. I'm in PT so I expect to gain back strength in that arm. Also the handle, as has been noted, is a bit wide. I guess that's to accommodate the different temperature displays, but really, Cuisinart needs to fix this. Also, the beep that tells you when your water has reached the right temperature isn't very loud. You really have to be listening for it. A.M.'s are busy at my house and unless I was standing near the pot I didn't hear it. That was a disappointment as it was one of the features that convinced me to buy it. I wouldn't suggest buying this to a person with small hands or weak arms.\n\nAll that said, it is attractive and does just what it says it does.

I make about two pots of tea and my roommate makes about two pots of french press coffee each day. We did everything to maintain and take care of the device in regards to cleaning, but it still broke.\n\nWhile it worked it was great. Capacity is right. Temperature is usually where you want it. As others have noted, the bell is pretty silent. I have sharp hearing so that didn't affect me too much. It heats the water fast and keeps it there to my satisfaction. It even looks good, though the numbers are easy to wipe off if you're not careful.\n\nI would not recommend this device though.

If you only make tea for two, it may be more than you need. As is, I usually run it less than a quarter full. Second, the printing on the controls started to rub off almost immediately. The \"Start\" disappeared within a couple of months and the other common settings are largely gone. Fortunately, by then I knew which buttons to push without looking at them. And finally, keeping the exterior looking good can take some work, but that's true for most thingss that are stainless steel.

I brew loose tea in a bottom drop tea diffuser and it makes a perfect cup every time. You can set the temperature depending on your tea variety on this kettle so it brews perfectly. I keep this at my desk at work and can pour in the water into the diffuser, then place the diffuser on my cup within 30 seconds. This way you get the perfect strength of tea instead of the time it normally took to walk from the coffee station with the hot water in the tea diffuser which generally makes strong tea. I also find since it brews the perfect strength, the tea leaves last quite a bit longer. I can generally get 7 cups instead of 3-4 out of each scoop of tea leaves (approx. 2 teaspoons). You also do not have to worry about the tea kettle from boiling over like the other models. Once the kettle reaches temperature, it goes into a warm cycle. No worries about boiling over since you generally do not need to set it to boil for tea leaves (there are 5 temperature settings below the boiling point).\n\n3/2013 upate- I have had this tea kettle over a year and it still going strong.

The water level indicator is wonderful- clear and precise and the blue light is an fun addition as is the cute beeping that signals the heating process is finished.\nMy biggest disappointment is that it is NOT quiet like some of the plastic ones are. Hence, only 4 stars. My kitchen overlooks the family room and when the kettle is in the middle of the heating process it is so loud that no-one can hear the telly ( TV ). The children turn the telly up very loud to hear it over the kettle. It is only for a little while, perhaps 30 seconds, but it is a nuisense none-the-less.\nHowever, since the telly isn't always on when I am making tea and it is a very nice looking, easy to use and efficient kettle otherwise, I will keep it and I am happy to do so. In fact, if I had read that it was not quiet I would not have gotten it and going on what I know now, I would regret not having it."},{"reviewerName":"Totoro","rating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"not recommended","reviewDate":"September 11, 2017","reviewText":"I have this since Dec 2015, so it is 3 months short of 2 years.

It's obviously made very well and is definitely worth the money spent.\n\n#### Update: 2012-04-16\n\nI've had this unit for almost 1.5 years now and know a bit more about kettles and tea making as well. I still agree with the five star rating.\n\nPros: It's durable, almost seamless, stays clean almost without intervention, heats quickly, leaves no plastic or chemical tastes, and heats quickly.\n\nCons: Twice now I've been able to turn the unit on when it's been below the \"min\" level. I thought the sensor was supposed to prevent this. When I did it this time, it seemed like I had broken it for good. Out of desperation, I took the bottom apart and the first thing I noticed is one of the electronic cables was jagged and probably loose. I removed the glue they used, which wasn't holding the connection in anyway and was rather stopping it from snapping into place. I had to use a flathead to push the connector in while the bottom was almost closed--there is very little slack on the cable, put the screws back in the bottom, and to my own surprise it worked again. I tested the temperature at boil and it was right on. By the way, the screws on the bottom are special triangle types. I used a very small allen (hex) which has six sides, so only three of the sides make contact but they are at the correct angles."},{"reviewerName":"Dana","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"I love this tea kettle!","reviewDate":"February 14, 2013","reviewText":"I use this kettle at work in between classes to make tea. Having the different temperature settings is absolutely essential as green and white tea both taste very bitter to me if they are brewed with water that is too hot.\n\nI use this kettle every day to make tea or to boil water for ramen noodles or soup. It heats quickly and to the perfect temperature. It does get a tiny bit loud as it reaches boiling, but it is not a big issue. Otherwise, it is completely silent until it gives you three beeps to let you know your water has reached the appropriate temperature.\n\nI also love the hold feature. If something comes up while I am waiting for the water to reach the appropriate temperature, I can simply press the hold button, and it will hold the water at the requested temperature for 30 minutes.\n\nI am very pleased with my purchase.

That being said - this kettle is worth every penny.\n\nMy husband drinks French Press coffee most mornings; I drink tea occasionally, and we make a lot of hot teas and hot chocolates during the colder months. Since we both use it for different (and very specific) things, this kettle is perfect. He uses the French Press setting, and I use the black or chai tea. You pick your temperature, hit start, and walk away. It is a little loud, but not annoyingly so, and I like that it helps me to remember it. The beep definitely is quiet. If you are in the next room, or watching TV, or just humming to yourself, you won't hear it. But since you can choose 'keep warm', it doesn't bother me. Next time I hear it warming back up, or walk into the kitchen and spot it, I can take it off the base and it's just as hot as if the beep just sounded. The base is another bonus - no cords to mess with, and you can spin it on the base to tuck the handle out of the way, or pull it back around to grab. And make sure you only grab the handle- the sides get HOT. Not warm, not a little hot. Straight up hot. I have brushed my arm against it a couple of times and quickly yanked it back. If you have small children, you will need to be careful with it.\n\nDespite the price, and the occasional arm-scalding incident, we couldn't be happier with this kettle. One kettle works well for our individual needs, it has a stainless steel interior (less plastic is always better in my book), the 'keep warm' setting means you can set it and forget it, and let's not forget that it just plain looks pretty sitting on the counter."},{"reviewerName":"MaciekSz","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Loose screw after 4 months of use, Cuisinart not helpful in resolving issue.","reviewDate":"July 11, 2018","reviewText":"I bought this unit 4 months ago from Amazon and it worked great (and maybe still does).

To me this is waste of resources, time, and money to handle it the way Cuisinart requires me to proceed.

There was one thing I should have considered when purchasing this kettle. The fact that I live at a high altitude. I currently live at around 10,000 feet above sea level. The boil feature on this kettle must be set to the temperature at which water boils near sea level. When using the boil setting it simply will continue to boil without turning off until I notice it or all my water evaporates. A little research helped me calculate the temperature at which water boils here and using the correct temperature setting it works great. The build quality of this kettle is wonderful, it feels solid and well put together. When pressing the buttons there is that satisfying click that lets you know you've done it correctly. The cord is a good length for almost any counter top. The finish does collect fingerprints as you would expect from stainless steel and the water level seems to be a little inaccurate at lower volumes, but nothing that most people would notice or find annoying.

If you over boil water for green tea it will taste bitter and using the temp control feature on this kettle makes the green tea taste so much better, every time. This kettle is good looking, easy to clean, fairly compact and is great when I have guests because it heats up so quickly and just very versatile for different uses (coffee,ice-tea, oatmeal, regular tea, keeping water warm). I also have a stainless steel kettle I use a lot in the traditional way on my gas stove, but this boils water faster when you have a lot of people around. BTW, for traditional tea kettles with no temperature control, I've heard to boil water and wait three minutes before steeping green tea, and it is approximately the right temperature at that point (but timing it just right is challenging for me as I get distracted, so I just prefer the kettle that does it for me).\nI have had this kettle for almost a year and would buy another one if it wears out, but I doubt that will be anytime soon."},{"reviewerName":"Ben","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Excellent and fast","reviewDate":"April 5, 2014","reviewText":"We had a much older version of this a long time ago and chose to replace it.

It would boil to a the preset temp., stop, then after it cooled, re-boil to the temp.

The feature of bringing the water back to boil has been irritating, as I make tea, sit down and then the kettle boils again, some may find this useful, we have switched this feature off, which thankfully you can do. The main thing that is really disappointing is that the lid is quite small, so the opening to fill the kettle is small, which may not seem a big thing, but if you want a full kettle, it gets quite heavy and having to keep it in a very exact position, is a nuisance.

I called cusinart and they told me to descale the pot using vinegar and water, which made no sense to me, but I tried it anyway. It sounds like this is common. Basically they told me that I can't just buy a new \"plate\" for heating, so just throw it away and they'd give me 20% off the purchase of a new one if I bought it through cusinart.com. Sigh. I hate this throw-away culture. I expect electronics not to last, but a kettle? At this price? It seems to me that it should last more than 3 years.

I am a coffee drinker and use both a French press and a Melitta pour through filter. Hence the need for a product that can heat to various temperatues.

After about a month of use, we noticed that it would often boil vigorously for quite a while before detecting that it had reached a boil and shutting off. Long enough that we feared it would not shut off and had to shut it off ourselves. I have a different brand and type of kettle at my workplace that only boils, and it is several years old and still works flawlessly, so I know that reliable boil detection can be done.\n\nI suspect that the hardness of our water might have something to do with it.

And having the perfect temperature is crucial for good tea. I drink a lot of black tea and the kettle lists boiling as the temperature to use for black tea. I disagree. I don't like my tea that hot. I use the white tea setting (185 degrees) for my black and my white tea and it's perfect for both. 185 is plenty hot to achieve a perfect infusion of flavor and then not be too hot to drink.

Pretty disapppointing when the sole purpose of the product is to heat water. After looking at reviews on various websites, the reliability of this product isn't worth the price as it will inevitably break within a year.

Great design, easy cleaning, made with dependable materials and the functions are unlimited. I use it for various kinds of tea, instant oatmeal, or hot chocolate with great success (10 yr old uses it more, no stove involved).\n\nI did a lot of research on these kettles, and I found that the one thing to avoid was kettles with plastic insides. This one, while not cheap, offered a great feature set, accurate temperatures, stainless interior, good controls, unobstrusive base, and pretty nice aesthetics.\n\nThe kettle is easy to fill, solidly built, and heats water very fast. It finishes its heat cycle with an authoritative BEEP that I can hear from the next room as I watch Sports Center. Another bonus is that even once it has reached temperature, it will keep the water at that temperature for up to 30 minutes, so if I'm busy doing something else, my kettle can wait until I get there, and my water isn't too cold or too hot! The most important thing about a good cup of french press coffee, besides the beans, is the temperature of the water.\n\nThe base is very minimal and you don't even notice it when the kettle is sitting on it, it looks like one piece of the kettle. The controls are easy to reach while holding the kettle by the handle, and the little LED light on the water level indicator is bright and helps you see the water level in a dimly lit early morning kitchen. It also automatically shuts off after a bit if the kettle heat has been turned off.

The 30 min keep warm feature is handy though haven't used it that often as expect it guzzles electricity in this mode.

Yes, the exterior becomes hot, they all do, but the design is sleek and well balanced, most people should only need one hand on the handle to pour.

If it breaks in a year, I can replace it 3 times before I end up with the same cost and it looks a lot like the Cuisinart, which appears to represent quality, but apparently only if you can afford a replacement every 18 months to 2 years.

Green and white teas are also much more enjoyable now; the bitterness I always ended up with heretofore is gone, leaving a much cleaner, smoother flavor. My only problem with this kettle is that the filter assembly in the pour spout doesn't allow for a clean pour with the last of the water.

But a few months ago, we decided it was time to retire our grungy old kettle, and I decided to make the leap to an electric model. I did a lot of research and was surprised at how many complaints these appliances generate. Finally I decided on the CPK-17.\n\nAnd, after three months, I have to say it's pretty much perfect--compact, great-looking, fast, and reliable. I use it most mornings to make French press coffee, but it works equally well for tea or speed-heating water for the stove. I don't detect any metallic flavor in the water, and I'm not noticing any scaling inside even though our water is pretty hard. Another nice feature: When you turn on the kettle, the button for the temperature you've selected flashes blue; after the water reaches temperature and the kettle beeps, the button glows a steady blue--so you can tell whether your water is hot enough even if you were out of the room and didn't hear the beep.\n\nIf I wanted to cavil, I guess I could say that the stainless steel tends to show fingerprints.

I read all the negative reviews just to see what I was getting into and decided to take the plunge (sort of like my tea bag).\n\nI didn't even give the kettle a chance for off flavors, I treated it to the 1 part vinegar/ 3 part water boil, cool, add 1/4 cup salt swish and let sit, rinse, 1/2 cup baking soda/water boil, rinse, scrub with my wand scrubber with light liquid detergent for dishes, rinse, rinse and voila, no added flavors that I don't want! Granted, there was a bit of a stainless steel odor when I first opened the kettle up, but I do think this is just what one deals with when getting a brand new stainless steel cookware item. I thought of it like a new fry pan, scrub down in hot sudsy water and rinse well.\n\nThe settings are a ton of fun to play with. And there is definitely a huge difference in the way my herbal teas taste at the proper temperature, no more icky bitters! For the tea drinker who drinks a variety of teas, this is the kettle for them! No more waiting around the stove for the kettle to whistle, this watched pot definitely boils quick!!\n\nThere was a commentary about how there is not an auto off feature. I didn't consider this an issue, as I do believe that electrical appliances should always be monitored. The kettle will stop boiling when the selected temperature is reached, then will reboil as the temperature drops. I figure that when I pour the cup I want, I just turn it off if I don't want another. If I do want another, the kettle keeps it going for when I get the second cup. Or I just turn it off, period, I am not that lazy that I can't monitor my own kettle!

I also like the easy-to-read measurements. 0.5 L = 16 oz.

However, something that's taken me some getting used to is the fact that if the \"keep warm\" was on, then when I pour the water and place the kettle back on the stand, it starts to heat my empty kettle! I know there is a safeguard but when I hear the empty pot boiling and alarming, I get a pretty big scare that I've burnt out the kettle. Be sure to turn off the \"keep warm\" button before lifting the pot if you plan on using all of the water. Overall, even with the hefty price tag, this kettle is so worth it!

It's been a really good purchase so far; at the time I was considering buying this kettle or the Breville One-Touch Tea Maker. Below are the reasons why I chose this product:\n1. At the time this kettle was a whopping $175 LESS than the Breville Tea Maker. Big difference there!\n2. The Breville seemed cool with its \"one-touch, brew the tea too\" option, BUT if you like to make different teas then you can easily switch temperatures with this kettle to go from black to green or oolong, etc without having to clean out the pot (which, with the Breville, would have all your steeped tea inside) to change teas. This works well because I rarely drink the same tea as the owner of the kettle (they prefer stronger flavored teas while I prefer sweeter, flowery notes in my tea).\n3. Did I mention $175 less? :)\n\nOther nice things about this kettle:\n* It's really sleek looking with the steel and blue backlight.\n* The buttons are easy to read and I like that the temperature and type of tea are on the same button, for those who may be forgetful about what temperature goes with what type of tea.\n* Reaches temperature within minutes. Very fast and easy to pour/refill.\n* Doesn't take up too much counter real estate\n* Doesn't have a million pieces (to lose/break)\n\nI don't know how loud other kettles are or if any are whisper quiet so I can't really compare the noise. This one only makes sounds when its reaching a boil and even then I think it's just the water boiling. The sound stops after the water reaches its temperature. The kettle's owner brought it in to work and said the sound is not too loud (and this is in a quiet, cubicle environment). The beep when the tea is ready is not too loud, but since the kettle keeps the water at temperature, it's no big deal. Just see if the temperature button you set has stopped flashing, and if so, your water is ready.\n\nYou still need a mug and brew basket or tea bags or whatever you use to steep your tea, as this is just a variable temperature kettle."},{"reviewerName":"plantgirl","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Love this kettle!","reviewDate":"June 8, 2015","reviewText":"I have owned this kettle for a few years and had no problems at all with it.

I use the kettle almost exclusively to heat water to make coffee each day in my French Press. I had not used an electric kettle in the past and was hesitant to spend money on one. However, the convenience of being able to get the water up to temp and keep it there while I am busy getting ready for work has been well worth the purchase price. My first impression of the unit left me a bit concerned about the durability of the temperature buttons, as they felt a little squishy to me. Since the unit is almost always set at 200 degrees, it's really just the start button that I put to use and it has worked fine.\n\nMy only grip with this kettle is that I wish the water window was offset rather than being directly behind/under the handle. I guess it would look odd from a design standpoint, but it would make the water level easier to see while the kettle is sitting in the sink under the RO water spigot. Once the kettle is on the base and turned on, the water level is very easy to see. I won't take a star away for this issue though as I have been extremely satisfied with this product and it could just be my aging eyes that are the problem.\n\nI only use filtered water from our reverse osmosis unit in the kettle, so I haven't had any issues with scale build up. I would definitely recommend this kettle to others."},{"reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Tea time!","reviewDate":"July 15, 2019","reviewText":"Love this teapot.

Goodman","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Designed for my entire tea collection, does the job nicely!","reviewDate":"February 10, 2011","reviewText":"This kettle is attractive, with its stainless steel carafe, updated shape, and pretty blue display - it should be, for its price. It's extremely easy to use, as the temperature, start and hold buttons all do exactly what you'd think they would do. And the fact that the kettle itself is cordless (the cord connects to the heating base) optimizes freedom and comfort of use.\n\nI have an extensive collection of teas of all types, so the various temperature settings take the guesswork out of heating water in a stovetop kettle. (I regularly use every one of the temperature settings!) Although my ear was becoming fairly well tuned to the sounds of my stovetop kettle, nothing takes the place of absolute certainty!\n\nBesides the various temperature settings, I am happy to finally have a kettle with a volume window. Before, if I wanted to use my larger teapot to make a partial (not full) pot of tea, I had to use a measuring cup to ensure the proper amount of water for the quantity of tea leaves I was using - a big pain. Although this is a common feature of electric kettles, I'm happy to have this feature combined with the various temperature settings this kettle offers.\n\nI'm not crazy about the way the Cuisinart pours, however. The somewhat irregular flow is probably due to the presence of the removable filter at the inside entry to the spout, but this is no excuse. It could have been better designed. It's especially annoying when I am pouring the last of the water out and, in order to get the last ounce or so to pour, I have to return the kettle to upright and then pour the last bit out.\n\nThe half hour hold feature is nice, but I'm finding I need a bit more time. An hour would have been better. As it is, I find that many times I need to manually turn the kettle back on, once its passed its half hour hold time, in order to finish up the remainder of the contents.\n\nAll in all, this product was thoughtfully designed and appears to be the only kettle on the market that truly satisfies the needs of the consummate drinker of a wide variety of teas."},{"reviewerName":"kokomo","rating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"... 3 months of light use and we are very disappointed in Cuisinart Warranty & Customer Service","reviewDate":"January 29, 2016","reviewText":"The pot lid quit opening after 3 months of light use and we are very disappointed in Cuisinart Warranty & Customer Service.

Wanted something that is not plastic, bigger (at least 1.5 liter) has a few extra features and looks ok. Did a lot of research and this kettle seemed like a good choice. Had it for 3 months now, works fine.\nThe pros: looks good; stainless steel so no plastic parts come in contact with water; large - up to 1.7L, comes handy for parties; has several temperature settings that are marked by the type of tea you'd like - black tea, green tea, white tea etc; has a \"keep warm\" feature.\nNow for cons: takes a while for water to boil- up to 5-7 min, I had a really cheap kettle before and it took like a minute to boil, with this one it takes long time even for a small amount of water; the \"keep warm\" function is crazy - it's automatically on all the time and unless you turn it off - it keeps boiling! It probably sounds ridiculous but it's really annoying that every time you pick up the kettle and put it back - you have to press 3 different buttons to turn it off! Otherwise, the kettle keeps turning itself on and keeps boiling water.Also, recently the kettle stopped turning itself off automatically on \"boiling\" setting at all! I can get around it and either use a different setting or manually turn it off but for the price - I would expect a bit more reliability!\nBottom-line - if you often make different types of tea, including \"delicate\" and \"oolong\" and need a larger kettle - this maybe a good purchase for you. If you don't care about settings and just want a quick cup of tea - this is definitely a completely overpriced product."},{"reviewerName":"Joanne","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"A must buy","reviewDate":"December 23, 2018","reviewText":"Nice looking.

Green tea is healthy and some people don't drink it (IMHO) because they don't know how to make it. If the water is too hot, or you steep too long, the tea will be bitter. By getting the water to the right temperature and steeping (I do about 3 1/2 minutes) it makes great green tea. This kettle allows temp control for various types of tea. Check the internet to get recommendations on temp and steep time for various types of tea and then experiment yourself.\n\nI noticed one reviewer commented on a scaling problem. Been using mine for a year and haven't had a problem. However, that will be due to local water supplies. If you have hard water a water filter is not going to change that. A filter may take out an itsy-bitsy amount of minerals, but you are always going to have minerals in your water unless you use distilled (which would taste yucky - minerals are needed for proper taste). If the water doesn't taste good plain, then your coffee or tea is going to be the same. If you leave the water in the kettle for a long time on warm, of course it's going to evaporate and leave a mineral residue. That's chemistry and physics, not the fault of any particular electric kettle. I heat the water and use it immediately and don't leave it in the pot, hence after a year I have zero scale build up. Love this kettle!"},{"reviewerName":"J","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great experience, and it does what it claims to do!","reviewDate":"April 11, 2014","reviewText":"I've had this product for a few months now and really love it.

I'm also a big tea drinker so the special tea settings are also quite a nice bonus.\n\nThe only downsides I've found are that design wise, it's a bit 'robot-looking' and I wish it was a bit more sleek and streamlined. (The image is true to what the product looks like.)

This product being rather new, the reviews were not clear on the 'seem-less and all stainless'. Now that I own one, I can assure you that there is at least ONE screw on the inside, and I'm assuming it is stainless steel as well but of most concern is the little knub of soft plastic/rubber against the handle. I haven't taken a close look at it's purpose but assume it wouldn't be there if it weren't safe to do so, even though this was something I was trying to avoid.\n\nI have used the kettle for a few weeks now. It is pretty, it is quiet, the variable temps work well, so other then that spot of plastic/rubber, it is what I wanted. I have considered returning it due to that little knub, but have grown fond of the kettle. I ordered 2 others as gifts and am waiting to hear the new owners thoughts as well.\n\nAs far as my research goes, I have only found ONE kettle out there that is truly seem-less and stainless on the inside.

It is helpful having various temp settings, although I generally only use 165, 190, or boil.\n\nIf it held two full quarts it would be slightly more convenient for me, but I seldom need two quarts. My only true negative is that it takes a bit longer than some kettles to detect that the water has reached the boiling point and shutting off.

I only remember that the lowest temp is on the upper left and boil is on the lower right.\n\n2) it's hard to put on the base. The portion of the base that has the protrusion for the electrical connection to the kettle is too high, requiring a vertical mount - dismount. I've had other kettles with this same mechanism that were lower, which made it much easier to put the kettle on the base. Not sure why this kettle's base needs to be so high.\n\n3) difficult to see how much you have filled - when filling from my counter top water dispenser, it's difficult to see the markings, becuase it's behind the handle, which my hand is holding on to.\n\n4) difficult to see how much water is actually in the kettle. you can only see how much water is in there when the blue light is on, which, if you have left the kettle off for a while, turns off. So you have to go over, pick up the kettle, place it back carefully vertically ( see point 2 ), then you can see how much water is there. The handle obsures the view of the water indicator.\n\n5) the display panel looks like a christmas tree! so what blue button, flashing or steady, means that this thing is actually turned on ? or is it a white light that means that its turned on ?\n\nThis kettle was replacing a $30 plastic krups kettle ( which they don't make any more, but sell a stainless version for $70 ).

Everyone's impressed by its look and best of all, how fast it boils water! My guests were experiencing cold, white christmas for the first time in the lives, so keeping them hydrated and warm was very important. They helped themselves to hot water and love how easy it was to fill it up for another boiling when necessary. There was enough water to make one big cup of coffee each for 5 people every morning, so we can all have breakfasts together. Love this kettle!

The variable temperature choices are wonderful, particularly in that I like my drinks hotter than my hubby. This kettle makes it possible for us to choose. I love the separate heating unit so that the kettle is not attached to the electrical plug. It makes it so convenient! It is quiet as well. The only suggestion would be to let us have a choice as to whether we have the ready indicator (beeps), on or off. As it is, it is unobtrusive to us, however the high pitch triple beep bothers our beagle for some reason. Thus it would be lovely if we could turn it off. However that is really not a problem.

It could be wonderful. Sadly, shoddy craftsmanship has ruined the experience. The kettle I bought leaks profusely after a year of use. I recommended it to a friend, and the circuit board on his crapped out six months after he bought it. This is not at all what I have come to expect of Cuisinart products and my recommendation is now to find a different brand which will actually work for a reasonable amount of time.\n\nOriginal review: I love this water kettle! I've recently begun drinking green teas and I always get the water too hot and the tea turns out bitter. The first cup I brewed with this water heater was wonderful. The keep warm feature is not as useful as I thought it would be, since I generally walk away from the kettle for more than half an hour. I also don't like the fact that the LED turns on every time you pick it up off the base. Other than those minor nitpicks, it is great. There are no funny flavors, the beep to signal that water is hot is loud enough to get my attention but not so loud its obnoxious, and it heats enough water for me and several friends to all have a large cup. The exterior does get warm as some reviewers have mentioned, but not truly hot. You might be able to burn yourself if you held your hand against it. I've brushed the outside with a hand several times and not been hurt. Also, the handle is perfectly insulated."},{"reviewerName":"Charlotte","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"A must have product","reviewDate":"March 27, 2019","reviewText":"My daughter made a great choice for me.

Then I take the tea ball out and set the pot to delicate to keep my tea warm. Sure, my pot turns dark after a few uses, but that's why i run vinegar through it once every few weeks or so.

It has been a good solution to the old problem of people heating water for tea and forgetting about the pot on the range. The CPK-17 turns off when attaining the correct water temperature. Except see note below.* We are all regular tea drinkers and it's especially nice for brewing green and delicate tea types. It also serves well for French Press coffee making.\n\n* My rating is 4 rather than 5 stars because after one year of service, on the boil setting it stopped working in regards to the beep and auto turn-off feature. We only use filtered water in it and it has never had a scale build-up so it is clearly a case of the unit simply failing with normal use. We called Cuisinart for service and were happy to talk to a real person, but a bit disappointed that the call took 30 minutes even though it should have been a simple affair of, \"it doesn't work properly anymore, it is still under the 3 year warrantee, please repair or replace.\" After much hold time and testing their own unit's operation, they offered to send a new one out, and we send the broken one back.

I guess I should be thankful they arrived damaged and that I haven't encountered this dismal policy until now. I will never purchase a more expensive electronic item from Amazon again and am SO thankful I opted to buy my food processor from Costco last month instead! If I have a problem with it I know Costco will simply return the item. Thanks, but I'll stick with them in the future. On the up side... The third person I spoke with at Cuisinart, Craig, was fantastic! I made several phone calls due to troubleshooting. Craig agreed that three months was an unreasonable product life and shipped me out my new tea kettle at no charge. I'm waiting for it to arrive and will return this one in the same box. Thank you Craig and thank you Cuisinart, because I do love this machine! I have owned their standard kettle for several years and never had a problem with it.

The kettle still consistently heats up quickly even at full capacity, and all settings operate properly. No electrical issues in either the kettle itself nor the base have been seen, and all of the lights and alert sounds behave as expected.\n\nThe kettle is sturdy and stable, and easily held at low to medium capacities, though the buttons are in an awkward spot once it gets full and heavy. It also doesn't have the surest grip when full; it can start to slide somewhat as the handle is pretty smooth all around. The base holds well to the surface it sits on, and a full kettle may need to be lifted prior to moving the base lest it skip if slid.\n\nThe filter is easily removed and cleaned, and we've not noticed any unusual cleanliness issues in the interior. Cleaning is a simple process and there is a reasonable amount of space for a brush to get in and scrub if necessary.\n\nI'd recommend it for anyone who wants a solid, sturdy, well-performing kettle that allows temperature control.

I boiled 5 pots of water before I actually used it and the smell still didn't go away. On the website, it says the plastic they use is BPA free so thats not the issue but I hate the smell. I will be returning the item for sure.\n\nBut if you don't mind the smell, this kettle boils the water in 7 min if you fill it to the max amount (1.7 Liter) - which is pretty quick. Also, when its boiling water, the outside surface is hot to touch. when I was cooking, my arm touched it by mistake and now I have a minor burn on my arm :/ yeah I know thats my clumsiness, but if you have kids around the house or if you are clumsy like me, thats another issue to watch out for.\n\nI gave 1 star to this item because 1) the water it boils smells like plastic, 2) I would rather to have all stainless steel and glass compartments rather than plastic compartments for the price I paid, 3) I will burn myself with this item\n- But on the plus side, it looks fancy and boils water fast."},{"reviewerName":"ShaunaIAm","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Not the most perfect pouring - I can see why not recommended for ...","reviewDate":"March 13, 2016","reviewText":"Not the most perfect pouring - I can see why not recommended for pour-over.

The versatility of the six temperature options is great - I've been drinking nonstop tea! The handle is very grippable, the speed with which it heats very quick, and the blue lighting over the water that lets you check how much water is left with much ease - all great.\n\nMy only concern is leaving the kettle sitting for a couple days without use. It could just be that I'm really sensitive to the taste of water in general (and I know it's not just the city I live in because I've brought this with me to a number of other cities and had the same problem), but I find that when I do this, the taste is kind of mineraly and stale... I think this happens to most water when you let it sit, though, and since I often drink 1.5 liters of it within a day or two anyway, it's really not that much of a problem!\n\nSome people say they've had trouble with it overheating, but I've had no problems whatsoever and would strongly recommend this to any connoisseur or newbie of the tea world alike :)"},{"reviewerName":"L. Dannenberg","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Hot 'n Ready and Georgeous","reviewDate":"February 9, 2012","reviewText":"So... My husband killed my leCreuset tea kettle about a year ago. When I went shopping for a replacement I discovered (much to my dismay) that I couldn't find just the right thing. So I started shopping for an electric tea kettle. Like other reviewers I wanted one that was not entirely plastic on the inside and out. This is for two reasons - exterior aesthetic and toxicity. It is entirely impossible to get entirely away from plastic in our environment. But after reading various reviews about plastic taste and weird smells I decided to look exclusively at stainless steel interiors for my electric kettle. This, of course, greatly increased the potential cost of my future kettle and narrowed my options considerably. I have been visiting this particular model on amazon for about 8 months. It seemed like a lot to spend and my 1 qt stock pot and electric range were doing the trick. I didn't NEED a fancy electric kettle. I kept dropping hints, hoping someone would get it for me as a gift. No one did. Seems like no one thinks kitchen electrics say \"I love you\" quite like accessories and spa treatments.

I also like that it beeps when it's done - 5 quiet chimes. I definitely like that the lid is insulated, and doesn't get very hot.\n\nI don't like that the scale is on the back - when you pour water into it while holding it in your hand, it tends to read low (the kettle tends to lean forward, due to the handle not very well designed). Have to adjust to pour less water into, in the hopes that it'll be correct when it's back on the base.\n\nBut there is a problem: the lid sticks when the kettle is hot. Sometimes it takes a few seconds to open, sometimes it doesn't open at all, and you have to wait for it to cool down (or pry it open with something - when is risky if you choose your fingers or nails). I ordered a replacement.\n\n/edit Replacement arrived today, and I see the problem. There is a slight difference in alignment of the lid. My first kettle has the lid shifted off-center maybe about 1mm toward the front of the kettle. This is enough to make it bind when it's hot.

Bought one for both sets of inlaws. Ours and my mother-in-laws were bought in summer 2014. Now in October 2016 had to replace one becauase the hinge on the top broke. Now have to replace a second because, as many reviewers have complained, the kettle stopped working suddenly. Lights up but does not heat up. I suppose 2 years is not bad, but it seems it should last longer.

A friend of mine was using a stove top tea kettle when I convinced him to buy an electric tea kettle. My old Cuisinart was still working like a charm so I told him to buy the same brand.\nHe received the NEW model and when I saw it, I ordered it for myself. I love to drink green tea and this model had multiple temperature settings and for green tea, the water can not be boiling or it ruins the benefits of green tea and makes it taste bitter. This is the best tea kettle I have ever used. I also ordered it for my Mom who loves her tea. If you are a tea drinker, this would be the ultimate. You can see the water level at a glance, use the \"keep warm\" setting and have another cup of tea in seconds. Not to mention the great blue neon light."},{"reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Very good for nonstandard (i.e. non-boiling) temperatures","reviewDate":"October 12, 2016","reviewText":"I love this kettle. I've had it for about a month and a half and it's great. If you don't turn it off, it will hold the selected temperature for you (it will keep re-heating as needed to maintain that temperature). If you take the kettle off the base during the heating process, you can use some water and then put it back on the base -- without pressing anything, it will resume where you left off and continue until the desired temperature. If you drink and hot drinks at temperatures other than just \"boiling\", this kettle is worth its price."},{"reviewerName":"Bonnie C","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Would definitely recommend.

If you rock it a little bit, it loses power. When you lift the pot, the BASE raises with it... Never had that problem with Breville.\n\nThe 4 stars come from how quiet and fast the machine is. The temp. is perfect so far. The machine really shines when it comes to tea. I use it for coffee as well, French Press, and it is perfect amount of heat. It is hot but still drinkable, it is not cold...\n\nI bought this product because the controls are on the handle which saves a lot of space. It is very simple, you hit the button for what you need the water for and press start. If you feel like your going to be distracted, you press the keep warm button and it holds for 20 minutes. LOVE IT!\n\nThe pro is that it is quiet, the con is that you have no idea when it is done. The machine will finish heating up the water and you have no idea.\n\nGreat Machine, I DO RECOMMEND. I believe 3 stars are for what is advertised and I gave it 4 for being quiet and space saving. Looks great. It lost a star for having a flimsy base that is very light weight and sensitive."},{"reviewerName":"Robert S.","rating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"No","reviewDate":"October 16, 2019","reviewText":"I bought this product mainly, for the convenience of the push button lid opener, which hasn't worked in over a month, I couls have bought a similiar product for half the price.

I like the various temp. selections for types of teas, aside from \"boil\".\nI use it about 8 x's per day, seems well made, love how it looks, less bulky like some of the others, well designed, esp. compared to my last pot, \"Chiefs Choice\", which was looked hunky, less streamed line, and not as well balanced-also did not like the vulnerable on/off switch on that Chiefs Choice.\n\nUPDATE: I've now owned this for 4months-the damn thing quit working this morning! Yesterday I had smelled a slight plastic or electrical burning/melting odor-now I know why! It turns itself off and nolonger heats.\nNow I'll have to go through the hassle of packing it up, go to post office, & sending it back to Cuisinart-I'll be at their mercy not knowing how long it will take to replace.

I have been very impressed with their coffee makers for years. So when I found myself in the market for an electric kettle, I naturally turned to Cuisinart. I was not disappointed. I don't fancy myself an expert, but I drink enough tea to know good from bad. This kettle helps me enjoy tea in a few different ways. The variable temperatures help bring out the proper flavors of different teas. If you are not afraid to shell out $30-120/pound for tea, it's nice to know you're getting the best flavor possible. It heats water much more quickly than a stovetop kettle. The stainless steel interior means your tea will taste like tea and not plastic.\n\nOther reviews mention problems with mineral build up. I have not owned this unit long enough to deal with that problem, but I imagine that regular and proper cleaning (mild soap, thorough rinsing and the occasional vinegar treatment) will help just as much as it would with any similar appliance. Also, being the half-snob that I am, I already filter my water anyway, so I imagine that helps as well.\n\nAll said, I highly recommend this kettle because it helps me make tea often and properly. I also recommend purchasing this product from Amazon because, when you factor in the free shipping, they have the best price I have found to date.

As I began to explore the fascinating world of fine teas, I was frustrated with getting the right temp for the more delicate teas, and looking for a simpler solution than the instant read thermometer stuck in the whistle hole of my stove top tea pot. The CPK-17 is the perfect solution to the perfect cup of tea. Initially skeptical about how much difference it could make, after only 3 days I am a believer. Even my wife, who is gadget-adverse, loves this electric kettle. Just select the temp/type of tea, press the start button, and a couple of minutes later it's ready.\n\nThe only thing to be aware of is if you are counting on the \"Beep\" to alert you to the water being up to temperature, you will probably be disappointed. The beeping is actually lost in the \"swirling\" sound of the water heating. The good news is that the pot can keep your water at temp for 15 minutes, and when the sound of the heating water goes away you'll know it's ready.\n\nHighly recommended for folks who appreciate a fine cup of tea."},{"reviewerName":"J.W.","rating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"was a Breville Schott Glass Water Boiler that is PERFECT for our needs","reviewDate":"December 12, 2013","reviewText":"It was loud, clunky, slow and not what we needed.

I bought the kettle a few months ago for it's ability to bring water to specific temperatures, and aside for the misleading temperature given for white tea, it fulfills this purpose quickly and efficiently. It is working perfectly well after two months of daily (or twice+ daily) use. My only complaint is that it specifies a temperature of 185 degrees F for white tea, which is much too hot for a typical white tea. The \"delicate\" setting provides the proper temperature for every white tea I drink which require 155-165 F water, but this is sort of thing is easily handled with a bit of tea preparation knowledge. Overall, a solidly built product which has removed the burden of personally checking the temperature of the water with a thermometer. Now I can start water for tea, shower, get dressed, and have everything set to brew my tea by the time I am ready to drink my morning pot. Truly a wonderful convenience that has allowed me to enjoy green and oolong teas in the morning and expanded my tea enjoyment horizons! Also, \"French Press\" setting is good for Pu-erh teas."},{"reviewerName":"Jamk","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"This is a wonderful addition to our kitchen appliances","reviewDate":"October 9, 2014","reviewText":"This is a wonderful addition to our kitchen appliances.

We are extremely satisfied with it and wish we had bought one years ago. It takes up about the same counter space as a coffee maker but is sleek and stylish. You can easily see the water level so you know with a glance whether you need to add water before you start heating.\n\nThe controls are very easy to see and use and it is great to have choices for the temperature relative to the type of tea (white, green, black, or French press coffee) you will be making. It does make some noise as the water heats, but no more than a regular coffee maker or espresso maker or regular tea pot. And it is fun to watch the water start to bubble.\n\nMy only complaint is that the little beep that tells you the water is ready isn't very loud; you can't really hear it from another room. However, since the water heats up so fast, you don't need to go do something else while you are waiting. By the time you get out your tea cup, preheat if and select a tea, you are almost ready to pour. If you do walk away to do something else, the unit will shut off automatically after 30 minutes and will not boil dry."},{"reviewerName":"Paul in NJ","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Probably the perfect pot of water","reviewDate":"January 4, 2016","reviewText":"We've had this for 6 months now and it's doing nicely.

This seems to be a chronic hazard of this category, unfortunately. I also have started drinking tea so thought having a device that would heat to different temps might be a good thing. (At the moment, I'm not entirely sure that this is important or necessary.) For these reasons, it seemed as if this, more expensive than I would normally want it to be, high quality kettle would do the trick and it is a different design than most of the others so didn't think leaking would be the problem and, so far, it's not.\n\nI've only had it for a few weeks and it is a pleasure to use and wonderful to have a kettle that doesn't intermittently leak all over the counter top at unexpected times. The problem is, as has been noted in other reviews, that the electronics in the kettle are defective. This manifests in it staying turned on long past the short time it's supposed to once it's returned to the platform. Even after I get it turned off, it will turn itself back on (as in the light) after that, at unpredictable times. Most of this is easily solved by simply not returning the kettle to the platform but alongside it, I discovered. (even when it's hot, the bottom is not hot so this can be done). I'd be willing to keep it and live with it that way if it wasn't for the fact that sometimes the electronics malfunctions in a different way, as in not turning on at all or turning itself off in the midst of trying to boil some water.\n\nFor the price I paid, seems as if this should not be an issue within weeks of receiving the kettle. It was 90 something dollars. Seems to me nothing about these things is likely to improve and it's more likely to get worse until the kettle doesn't function at all. Given that it's not a manual or simple electric connection and depends on the more complex electronics, I will sadly be returning it.\n\nNow I don't know what to get."},{"reviewerName":"Irina","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Just perfect!

Just wanted some hot water.\n\nI drink a lot of tea but just a cup at a time and since all kettles under $90 seem to have a death note out on me I thought I would give this a try. Turns out a made a great call. It takes about two minutes to heat up water to the green tea setting and about three to boil. I pour a 16 oz bottle of water in it, since that's all I drink at a time.

I purchased on this less expensive Cuisinart after reading the reviews. It makes my tea brewing so much easier. I drink different types of tea and pressing on the right temperature makes it convenient to steep the tea right away instead of waiting for the water to cool down. I tested the temperature and it is pretty close to the setting when I first got it. Since I drink a lot of tea, it helps that I have more than a liter of hot water at my disposal. It is sturdy, too as I move around a lot and it is still intact and operating smoothly. Mind you, I drink tea year round, even in the hottest days of summer. I would drink tea all day, switching from mate to white tea to herbal as the day progresses into the evening. If you're looking into investing a high quality electric tea kettle, I recommend the Cuisinart CPK-17 Perfect Temp. I purchased this without being asked to review by the manufacturer or retailer.

It needs some sort of air gap between the skin and the internal contents.

It is nice to set it at 200F and then let it do its thing.\n\nIts a little loud. Which is weird but when its heating up you hear this loud sound coming from it. Like the squirrels are working extra hard to get the water to boil.\n\nUpdate - it just died. So I got a solid 5 years out of it but for $90 I guess I was hoping it would last longer. The numbers completely rubbed off the front of it after year 1, the calcification got pretty bad but that's the water's fault not the kettle. Served me well for 5 years. Sorry to see it go.

Allow the nail polish to dry before using the kettle. If you do not take precautions to seal the painted, not embossed buttons, the writing will rub off and disappear in no time! Other than that issue, this kettle is wonderful, especially for those of us who live at high altitude. At this altitude (6000 feet above sea level) water boils at approximately 200 degrees.

Needs a tweak or two.","reviewDate":"May 3, 2012","reviewText":"Fantastic kettle. Great design, a wide range of choice temperatures, stainless steel interior. I'll let the others speak for those. This is the best electric kettle on the market without exceptions. But you can make it better, and the next version of it could use a few changes:\n\n1) Totally eliminate all plastic components that contact the water.\n\nThe scale filter is removable. Thats in the product literature. But the scale filter bracket is plastic, and it still touches the water when you pour it. It also messes up the flow of the water. Fortunately, that can also be removed! There is a single screw that attaches it to the wall of the kettle with a hex nut. Unscrew it with a pair of pliers and it's done. Be sure to remove the hex nut and the two washers - you dont want to be swallowing those by accident. I've attached pictures of the removed bracket. In the future, this kettle would benefit greatly from a metal scale filter and bracket that can be totally removed.\n\nFortunately, once you remove the scale filter bracket, it pours like a dream.\n\nThe lexan water height meter leeches BPA. That is a damned shame about this kettle. And the water there gets HOT. This should be made out of glass, or simply removed totally. If you want to know how much water is in the kettle, you can open it! Look, I agree it's pretty, and it reflects blue light when theres water in there, but it's unhealthy. Health is more important than the little lexan window! And it's pretty enough already!\n\nBottom line - remove the window completely. Put markers on the inside of the kettle indicating the volume if you must. This lexan meter is a real spoiler.\n\nFinally, the silicone nubs. I don't care if people think they are safe, get them out. You dont need a silicone nub to measure the temperature of the water, and you should take out the nubs related to the water level window. Fixed.\n\n2) The kettle is a pain to carry for long distances. There is no handle to hold the weight of the kettle from the top. So if you have to walk with a full kettle for more than a few feet, it's rough on the wrist, because you're holding it from the side. And you can only hold it one handed. There should be a long rotating handle over the top that can fold down out of the way when not needed, but can be used to carry the kettle from above. Again, we can see the product designer getting in the way of a proper device. Sure, you want clean and modern. But a little old lady cant walk very far with these things, and a rigid swiveling handle that rotates down under the pour spout would also let someone hold the weight with one hand while pouring with the other. How is that little old lady going to have her tea parties now?\n\n3) The stainless steel exterior is great, but (a) it's a fingerprint magnet, and (b) it gets too hot. For (a), the exterior should be clearcoated. We see lots of clearcoat stainless steel appliances today, and they are good with the fingerprints. not perfect, but good. Also, they feel much nicer than the metal. For (b) make the kettle's walls double layered stainless steel with air in between. This will allow it to retain heat longer. Also, it wont damage the clearcoat. The kettle is not too large, and it could reasonably be made slightly larger in order to permit a double layer. Also, you dont need the fill guage, so the double layered walls arent stopping anything.\n\n4) The pour spout is FANTASTIC once you eliminate the scale filter. Do not mess with that!"},{"reviewerName":"James Harris","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"is very happy with it","reviewDate":"January 6, 2017","reviewText":"Again a gift ....person just loves it, is very happy with it."},{"reviewerName":"Katarina Pantic","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"I love my electric kettle","reviewDate":"February 7, 2017","reviewText":"I love my electric kettle!

Truly unforgivable is the faulty temperature sensor, which resulted in steam damaging my kitchen cabinets. Other reviews indicate this is a common problem.\n\nPros:\n- Appearance & design.\n- Multiple temperature settings.\n\nCons:\n- After a few months of light use (once-twice per day), the low-quality temperature sensor fails to turn off the unit until several minutes of boiling. The released steam envelops the cabinetry above the kettle, which I discovered has damaged my kitchen cabinets. Given the cost of this kettle and the cost of replacing kitchen cabinets, this is absolutely unforgivable and makes me reluctant to ever buy from Cuisinart again.\n- The labels on the buttons smudge off after a few months of light use. Not only does this look ugly, but you have to guess which setting corresponded to which temperature.\n- The lid started jamming when I push the button to open it.\n\nOverall, a cheap made-in-China gimmick marketed and priced as a fancy European product."},{"reviewerName":"Allie C","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Love it!

It has now been four weeks and after three more calls to their customer service I finally have a date when the base will be available - it isn't for another 4 weeks! So by the time I receive the new base it will be a total of 8 weeks. I am now in the market for a new kettle because I am so fed up with waiting on a base unit.

They really admired it and I must say it is very attractive with its brushed stainless steel finish and light up buttons. I continue to use it on a daily basis. I love that it has a setting for green tea (which I use and drink all the time. Yes, my green tea is better now) Besides that being my favorite feature I also enjoy how it pleasantly beeps when it reaches the desired temperature setting. I thought I'd miss my whistling tea kettle, but rather this is so much less stressful than jumping for that noisy stove top version!\n\nPros:\n*Attractive\n*entirely stainless steel\n*convenient easy to operate light up buttons (one each for 160 degrees= delicate, 175=green, 185=white, 190 = Oolong, 200=French Press, Boil=black, start, and keep warm printed on each button) and stay warm feature\n*small foot print and easy to set up\n*Pleasant beep sound when ready\n*works fast\n*pours nicely\n*plenty big enough\n\nCons:\n*Entire outside gets extremely hot and could severely burn if not picked up by the handle (entire handle stays cool though)\n*a little pricey (entirely stainless steel finish so forgivable in my book)\n\nAmazon shipped this out with lightning speed, at better pricing and free shipping which saved me about $20 over my local store so that made me very happy. My husband is disappointed by how hot the outside gets (similar to how a stovetop teapot gets). We are spoiled by our insulated coffee pot and if this item were insulated like that it would be perfect, however I still love it! (he on the other hand would have given it less stars for that)\n\nI wondered if it would continue to heat once removed from its base (I was hoping it had some sort of charging feature), but that disconnect stops all electricity and all the lights turn off, etc. However, it stores the settings for up to 2 minutes so it will automatically return to its last setting if you return it in time.\n\nIn summary, I'm very happy with this purchase and recommend it.\n\nPS: I haven't had any scaling issues as other people have mentioned. I use filtered water and feel that any complaints on that have to be directed to the water used, not the kettle."},{"reviewerName":"haywhitmom","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Tea anyone?","reviewDate":"November 15, 2014","reviewText":"Great gift for my hot tea loving brother-in-law.

It is attractive enough to leave on the counter. It is easy to use and heats the water VERY quickly.\n\nIt's only downside is the opening is small so you need a bottle brush to clean inside."},{"reviewerName":"RN9","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Stopped working after 3 months","reviewDate":"April 23, 2012","reviewText":"Purchased this kettle on January 27, 2012, used it as much as several times a day to as little as 1-2 times a week, and by mid-April it stopped heating water entirely. The unit powers on and programs as usual but after about 3 minutes, it beeps three times and shuts off leaving cold water in the kettle. Please note: I was very careful in my handling and care of this kettle. I did not get the controls wet, the unit was never washed in soapy water or submerged (I only wiped it down inside and out with a well-wrung out damp microfiber cloth sans cleansers of any kind), I did not utilize the \"keep warm\" feature nor leave the unit plugged in or on after use (it was always returned to a cabinet (carefully!) after it cooled), it was never dropped, banged, manhandled or otherwise mistreated. In fact, I babied this kettle. The thing still broke.\n\nWhen the unit works, you will love it. When it fails so soon after purchase, you'll be kicking yourself, probably saying (as I did), \"Something told me not to buy this! Why the heck do these types of things always break so darn quickly nowadays?\"\n\nWhile this product does come with a 3-year limited warranty, you must pay $15 s&h to Cuisinart to ship you a new or repaired unit as well as pay to return the broken kettle (approx. $15). So, you're looking at spending $30 to get a functioning kettle which is roughly 40% of the intitial purchase price.\n\nReading through the low-star reviews, I see that it's common for the kettle to stop working within several months of use so I won't be spending another $30 for a replacement given chances are good that the replacement kettle will fail in a few months time as well.\n\nIn my opinion, to have an $80 tea kettle fail after three months is wholly unacceptable, and due to its high failure rate within a relatively short period of time, I cannot recommend this product.\n\nCaveat emptor. Seriously."},{"reviewerName":"shortnsweet","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"was working well until....","reviewDate":"January 5, 2012","reviewText":"I was so thrilled with this electric kettle initially that I would have given it 5 starts except about a year after I've been using it daily, it just completely stopped working for no reason.

Cannot turn the *&%^$#$ thing OFF!!! Wakes everyone up. Incredibly annoying.\n\nHere's how it works. Pour in water, press temp button, press start, water hits temp quickly and kettle beeps like ten times really loudly (which you can't turn off by the way so it wakes up everyone within earshot) , pour out hot water, replace on base, try to turn of by pressing start button as it says in instructions --- but it won't turn off! It just continues to flash and flash and flash at you. Start button has no effect at all. To get it to turn off after you pour out the water, you have to leave it on the counter, still very hot by the way, and not replace it on the base for a while. Finally after enough time has passed you can put it back on the base and it remains off. Stupid design. Every electrical appliance should have an OFF switch that turns off the item immediately - for safety's sake -- it's only common sense.\n\nDo not buy if you have to use this early in the morning and someone in your family sleeps near the kitchen. It sounds like a really loud alarm clock when it reaches the target temp and it wakes them up. I now have to take it to a bathroom, and use it with the door closed to keep it from waking my kids. The previous kettle i had may have been cheap plastic, but at least it did not operate as an alarm clock and wake up the baby."},{"reviewerName":"Harold N.","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"and the coffee to me was much better than with the drip maker","reviewDate":"August 24, 2016","reviewText":"Several weeks ago, the filter holder spring on my Krups drip coffee maker failed. I tried to replace it but the replacement did not fit properly. While waiting, I used a small coffee press that I had used on a trip several years ago. The press was so simple and inexpensive, and the coffee to me was much better than with the drip maker, a much richer, stronger taste requiring less coffee. So I ordered a larger double filtered, double walled press and the Cuisinard kettle. A match made in heaven! I use distilled water which I buy by the gallon for drinking purposes anyway. The kettle quickly comes to temperature, maintains it for 30 min., and is very simple and easy to use. I enjoyed it so much that I went to Teavana and got one of their 32 oz perfectea makers. The cuisinard kettle heats and maintains the water at the proper temp for whatever you are making. For the first time, I made tea properly. I highly recommend this kettle."},{"reviewerName":"JosephM","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Perfect","reviewDate":"July 16, 2013","reviewText":"At first I was a little put off by the cost but this kettle is totally worth it. I am currently a graduate student and work strange hours and often need a cup of coffee or tea at strange hours of the day and night. Before getting this kettle I only made tea at home because I wanted to get the temperature for my green and oolong teas just right.

The kettle looks nice, and the keep warm feature is good too. Looks pretty, and it pours fine.\n\nThat said, we had the unit for 11 months and it broke - it just stopped heating water despite the lights and buttons seeming to work. Good thing it has a 3-year warranty, right? Wrong. It'll cost you $15 for Cuisinart to ship you a replacement, and then ~$15 for you to ship the defective unit back to Cuisinart. Sure, I'm spending $30 as compared to the current price of $85, but this thing shouldn't break inside of a year. It's not like I'm using it commercially at a coffee shop.

The temp options and the 'keep warm' function are things you're not likely to find on other similar choices. The 'ready' bell is very faint, but the water heats so quickly you may not have even left the kitchen by the time it's to temp. I will be checking with the manufacturer, though, because starting with the 5th or 6th time I used it, it has emitted a high-pitched sort of whine while it's heating the water. It annoys the cats more than it does me, and it may just be where or how I have it situated on the counter. It's a great pot."},{"reviewerName":"Tex","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Perfect kettle","reviewDate":"November 23, 2016","reviewText":"This kettle is perfect for heating water for many purposes, but especially for tea and instant drinks.

I mean, let me correct myself, it boils fast, but you know when you sometimes start boiling the water and then you remember something else you needed to do and then you might even forget about your tea at all? This is the case where its burning SO MUCH energy, since anytime the temperature goes lower than it it should be at the boiling point...it REBOILS IT AGAIN!!!!!!

Not a big deal really but I find that to be a minor annoyance.\n\nMy other dislike is the beeper that signals when the water has reached the set temperature. It needs to be louder. Of course if it were louder then some other folks likely would complain that it is too loud. So it would be nice if they would incorporate a variable loudness setting.\n\nI have noticed that in a few reviews people are blaming scaling (mineral deposits) that forms in the kettle on the kettle itself. Scaling is an issue that depends on your particular water chemistry. No kettle can prevent scaling if your water is hard. If your water is hard then any kettle will form scaling if you do not rinse it properly. If you frequently pour to the very last drop of water do not just set the empty kettle back on the base. Fill it with a cup or two of water, give it a quick swirl, empty that and then fill it back up for next time. Doing that will help keep that last thin film of water in an empty kettle from completely drying. When that thin film of water dries that is when minerals are deposited.\n\nIf you do get scaling occasionally pour a cup or two of white distilled vinegar in the kettle , heat it up, let it cool and then wipe out the insides with a cloth."},{"reviewerName":"oldman","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"A Good Buy","reviewDate":"March 22, 2013","reviewText":"I've been using this electric kettle for instant coffee every day, all day, for nearly a year.

It's not a hazard by itself, but it will definitely surprise you whn it pops open while pouring, and possibly cause you to splash hot water in reaction.\n\nWater level on the outside is hard to read unless it is back lit by being on the stand.\n\nTop opening is fairly small (not a huge deal, unless you have a large hand and want to clean the pot).\n\nIt's heavier (undoubtedly beause of its meta construction) than my old kettle.\n\nI liked this at first, but the negatives keep adding up.

I am just past the three month return policy on Amazon, so now I'll try to get Cuisinart to either send me a new one, or refund my money. Too much hassle for only three months.

We are on the second kettle now (first one was replaced under warranty) and it failed again. The first kettle's lid would not close after almost one year of use, due to faulty mechanism - clearly a safety issue. The second kettle electronics stopped working - it would heat water to warm temperature, then stop and never reach boil. Most of the positive reviews may be based on short-term use, users impressed by nice design and features. However, long-term performance of this item is well below average (at best). I also confirm disappearing print on the temperature buttons - expect about one year of use before print on the most frequently button fades completely. Poor customer service - after calling Cuisinart and reporting second kettle failure, I was told it is out of warranty.

Happily surprised that I do use all the settings more often then expected. I am a regular tea drinker and it is truly fantastic to have a pot that gets the correct temperature for different types of teas. Really makes a difference and I'm happier than I thought over a teapot.\n\nThe only caution is the entire pot gets quite hot so you really must be careful and hold it solely by the handle.

Gets hot water ready in very short order.\nOddly the instructions don't say anywhere how to shut it off, but it becomes apparent that by pushing the start button when you are done heating turns it off. The button should read start/stop, or Start/Off. But you just have to catch on on your own. The price seems a little high, but if it works for a long time I will be satisfied.

But honestly, how often will you be using different temp settings anyway?! I thought that if I buy a kettle at a little higher price with a reputable company, the quality would be much better. But after 2 months of constant use of the kettle, it started to have problems. When I wanted to boil water, I must push 'START' a few times, \"hoping\" that the kettle would work and boil water. This is honestly not something I expected from this brand.\n\nSo I called customer service for their warranty coverage. Their customer service actually charges you $15 for them to ship you a new one within warranty. I complained to the supervisor that I've never heard of such a policy where you charge the customer additional cost for shipping. After all, it was your product that was defected after I spent about a $100 using this kettle that only lasted for 2 months!! Not only did they say that I need to pay $15 for them to ship me a new one, I have to pay for shipping of the old one back to them!!!

Farner","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"It is great for what it is designed to do!","reviewDate":"March 9, 2014","reviewText":"* Updated - It is now almost 4 years later and it is still working great. I still stand by my original review! Great Product!!!!\n\nAfter buying it as a Christmas present for myself, I have thoroughly enjoyed it and have used it all day long every day. I read the bad reviews before and after I bought this kettle. Here are some observations from what I read in the 1 and 2-star reviews. For those of you that have had the kettle only last for a few months, to a year... I know that this kettle is expensive and should last longer. I would bet that after you pour a cup out of your kettle, you just set it back on the stand and walked off. This will put it into the hold temperature mode for about 30 more minutes. I know this is a feature but do you really need it to hold 212 degrees for an additional half hour? If you turn it off and then go back 30 minutes later and heat it again, it only takes a minute or two. Leaving it on puts unnecessary extra wear on the product fuse and heating base. I'm not defending it for burning out early, just suggesting a way to extend the life of the kettle. Next, I have read that after a month, a man and his wife still couldn't figure out how to use it. Really?! You push the temperature you want and hit start, it beeps and stops blinking when ready. Got to wonder about that poor rating. Another one complained that it didn't boil water any faster than their kettle on the stove. This is the one that gets me the most. If all you want to do is boil water, then save your money and boil water on your stove. This kettle is designed for tea lovers and press drinkers where a more precise temperature is required. This is what it is designed to do. If you throw boiling water over say, green tea, you have destroyed it. Press is best at 200-205 degrees. I, personally, got tired of boiling water then standing there with a thermometer waiting for the temperature to drop for my press coffee. If you just want to boil water... skip this and save your money. Another complaint was that the bottom was flaking off the inside of the kettle. It's called \"mineral deposit\", from your water. A little vinegar boiled once a month will solve this. If you have a coffee maker (it's the number one reason it will quit working) or a tea kettle on your stove, it's in there too. Another complaint was it was hard to fill and see the level. If you pick it up off the base and set it back down, it will light up and it becomes the easiest item you'll ever own, to refill. And lastly, several complained it was hard to keep fingerprints and dirt off of it. It's 'STAINLESS STEEL', wipe it with a damp sponge and dry it off. I have enjoyed it so far because it does what it is designed to do. A little preventive maintenance (turn it off when not needing it), routine cleaning ( as you should be doing with your coffee maker) and common sense ( the biggie) then hopefully you will not regret purchasing this kettle. For those that have treated it correctly and still had problems, you have an actual right to complain, but those other reviews, like described above, c'mon guys... common sense."},{"reviewerName":"Ben Dodge","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"High quality","reviewDate":"February 12, 2019","reviewText":"Very high quality, fits in very well with my kitchens decor"},{"reviewerName":"Master Val","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Five Stars","reviewDate":"March 5, 2016","reviewText":"Great sophisticated kettle, looks great, works great, boils water fast"},{"reviewerName":"Randy l.

Quiet. One thing that could be added to the product is an \"off\" button. It does automatically switch off after a certain period of time when using the \"keep warm\" function, but if you want it off before that time you have to pull the plug. Also, an \"off\" would be handy when you are waiting for water to boil but get impatient and use the water before it boils - if you restore the kettle to the base it will continue on and boil, so you have to pull the plug.

My wife would rather have a kettle where you simply press the button and away you go! The main issue we find with this kettle is that is you leave it off the base for any period of time, say 5 mins, it forgets your settings. This means it defaults to the warming setting each time which simply means you end up with copious amounts of steam around the kitchen. It is also a little bit plasticky, we used to have a Bosch kettle by Porsche design and compared to that kettle it feels a little cheap. There is also no insulation between the chamber and the outside so keep little hands away."},{"reviewerName":"Heathcliff718","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Best kettle ever!!!!","reviewDate":"January 5, 2013","reviewText":"For anyone who drinks tea, especially those who buy from stores such as teavana, should have one of these in their home!!!

The lighted window on the side is nice to see the level of water, but it is difficult to see the level when holding it in the sink to fill it. The window would have been much better had it been on the side of the kettle. Additionally, would it have killed them to insulate the side of the kettle? I nearly burned the heck out of my hand when I picked it up. Yes, the handle is fine. However, don't touch the side of it, because it's as hot as the water is! I can't believe there wasn't a single warning on the box, the kettle, or otherwise. It's kind of ridiculous to have paid so much for a kettle that is not insulated one bit on the sides.

I really wanted to like this too (I love tea, and I want to enjoy the process of making tea). Here are the reasons why I am pleased to be sending it back.\n\n1) The kettle comes with a label on it. Peel off the label and the metal underneath is a different color to the rest of the kettle. It aint adhesive, it aint coming off! So for the whole life of the kettle you'll have a big rectangle area on the front that is a different color to the rest of it.\n\n2) It is way too heavy for a darn kettle\n\n3) The outside gets really hot and it is very easy to burn yourself.\n\n4) Too hard to turn on. Seriously, it is a kettle ... the whole 'pick your temp' thing ... i am still not sure if I have to hit start afterwards. I think not, i think the start button actually stops it. Also, while I am ranting, during the water in the kettle must be different temperatures in different places, I am not sure I fully believe that when I pour the water it really comes out at the temperature it claims. I'd love to know if anyone tested it (watch your household thermometers, though, they may go pop).\n\n5) Too easy to leave on. First day of usage I kept leaving it on 'keep warm'. Who wants this feature anyway? Maybe your tea and drink it, manufacturers ought to be discouraging consumers from wasting the planet's resources by keeping their kettle boiling for half an hour.\n\nTwo starts because it does look quite nice, it can boil water and I admire them for trying to make it beautiful."},{"reviewerName":"IO","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Five Stars","reviewDate":"September 19, 2015","reviewText":"Have had this now over a year and love it. would totally buy again."},{"reviewerName":"Chris Sbalch","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Five Stars","reviewDate":"September 23, 2014","reviewText":"Great product, gave as gift to my son and he has no problems with it.

It's very attractive, it's very easy to use, it heats quickly (1.7 liters of room temperature water to a boil in about 7 minutes), and those temperature settings really do matter. It's well insulated so it tends to hold heat well even without the 30-minute stay-warm timer turned on.\n\nI drink French press coffee and green tea, so this kettle gets used a lot (at least twice a day), and I can attest to the difference that the various temperature settings make. 200 degrees makes for wonderful French press coffee, and 175 takes the \"bite\" out of green tea while preserving all the delicate flavors. Although I typically only use those two settings, they are REALLY nice to have.\n\nYou can't get your hand inside this kettle, but then again you shouldn't have to. The sight glass is pretty much covered by your hand on the handle when you are filling the kettle. I think that's an acceptable design compromise and not an issue as a practical matter. I use the time-tested method of looking inside as I am filling the kettle to see how full it is getting. The sight glass *looks* great - it is illuminated along with the buttons on the handle - and it is easy to read when your hand is not wrapped around the handle so you can tell if you need to add water before hitting the start button. That's all I need from a sight glass.\n\nEase of use is excellent - one handed operation in a dimly lit room is a snap. Thumb the desired temperature, thumb the start button. Soon you will hear 3 beeps (audible without being annoying) that let you know that set point has been reached. Aside from the beeps, the light on the temperature select button goes from blinking (heating) to solid (at set point temp).\n\nThis kettle draws 1500W, so be mindful of what circuit it is plugged into and what else is on that circuit. Also consider whether you need to heat a full kettle for a cup of tea. The less water you heat, the faster it gets to set point temp and the lower your power consumption.\n\nThere is a removable fine screen filter in the spout - I found it made pouring tricky and I removed it.\n\nAll in all, this kettle has worked its way into my everyday routine in a way that no other kitchen appliance has (and I have quite a few). If and when it dies, I'll replace it with an identical unit. I'm more than pleased with it. It looks great, works great and is easy to use.\n\nI would recommend this kettle unconditionally were it not for the 1- and 2-star ratings that reveal a high manufacturing defect rate. I suggest reading those reviews. I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 due to the nagging fear that the kettle will fail in normal use. Cuisinart really should take a look at the manufacturing defect rate on this product. It has a nasty tendency to cease working. Some report failure not only in the kettle received, and also in the REPLACEMENT that was sent to address the first failure. That's a clear red flag ... but I was prepared to take the risk in light of the features offered for the price. Hopefully I won't be revisiting my rating on a product failure."},{"reviewerName":"Janett","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Tea lover bliss!","reviewDate":"January 11, 2014","reviewText":"I have gifted myself this kettle 2 weeks ago, and I have been in tea heaven ever since, working myself through my tea collection and rediscovering what my favorites taste like when brewed at the perfect temperature.\n\nWhat a perfect addition to my kitchen.\nHighly recommend."},{"reviewerName":"Michael D.","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Five Stars","reviewDate":"January 20, 2016","reviewText":"Heats up very quickly!"},{"reviewerName":"CA-Claire","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Bet one I've had.

This is just what I needed.\n\nPros:\n- Easy Setup: Just open the box, give it a quick rinse before filling with water, plug it in, and you're good to go.\n- Easy to use: The intuitive design makes it quick and easy to see if the kettle is on or not, how much water is inside, and what temperature the water is.\n- Multiple temperature settings: No matter what kind of tea you are brewing, you can get the water to just the right temperature to bring out the best flavor of the tea.\n- Tea in minutes: No more waiting for water to boil and then cool to the right temperature, or starting the water boiling and forgetting to turn it off. The water is quickly heated to the correct temperature, and the kettle keeps it at the temperature for up to 30 minutes. You can turn it on, walk away, and when you come back your water is perfect for whatever tea you are making.\n- Light weight: Easy to pick up and pour, even when it is full.\n- Cordless: The cordless design and swivel base make this work a lot like a traditional stove-top kettle.\n\nCons:\n- It's louder than I expected while heating the water. It doesn't disrupt other activities, but it was a surprise the first time I turned it on. It's also only noisy while the water is heating, so just for a few seconds at a time.\n- The outside of the kettle gets really warm. The handle stays cool, so I didn't notice the heat until I accidentally bumped the side. No injuries, but I would definitely take care to keep it away from small hands.\n- The small top opening makes it hard to get clean. Luckily, my hands are small enough to fit in there to dry it out between uses, but I don't think my husband could clean it.\n\nOverall, the few problems are relatively minor compared to the ease of use and overall design of this kettle. I am sure this will stick around for a long time and see a lot of use in our home."},{"reviewerName":"Joseph Mancuso","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Quick delivery.","reviewDate":"December 21, 2018","reviewText":"Great product.

The warranty looks 'great' as well - on the surface. The problem is - I'm on the second one of these and it no longer works as it should. The first one failed within 10 months of daily use. Cuisinart's very courteous customer service replaced it for me at 'no cost'; MINUS my shipping cost to them and MINUS their shipping cost to me. Which ended up being about half of the original purchase price. I used the second unit for about 6 months before it starting experiencing problems as well. While the first one failed outright (you set the temperature, hit start, it beeps and does nothing); the second one simply does not heat any more to the selected temperature. A few examples: you chose a setting and it runs for about 15 sec, then beeps and stops. To get it going again, you have to select the temp one step below what you actually want, let it warm up to that temp and stop, then select the temp you REALLY had in mind, and it will warm up some more and produce the desired temperature. When it's in the mood to do so... From time to time it shuts off within 10 sec no matter what the temp selection. Other times, but not ALWAYS mind you, when you set the temp to 200 F (which is what I use most of the time for green tea), it brings the water to boil instead. And when you set the temp to Boil - it sure does bring it to boil (whenever it is not in the mood to shut off after 10 sec that is); then keeps boiling and boiling and BOILING for a good 10 minutes before it finally shuts off. It looks to me like either the control unit or the temperature sensor(s) are not built to last. The bottom line is - the purpose of this water kettle (brining water to desired temperature) is not fulfilled. It works for a period of time, than breaks. Not worth buying. I bought a replacement multi-temperature kettle from ALDI for $9 for when my Cuisinart dies. If the ALDI unit fails, I don't care. It was $9. Plus I kept the receipt and they WILL take it back at REALLY no cost to me. None of the $30 spent shipping back and forth for yet another piece of junk. Needless to say, I think I will be staying away from the Cuisinart brand going forward. And most definitely - I will never EVER again be gettin one of their water boiling products."},{"reviewerName":"Linda Bavido","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Love being able to select the right temp for the ...","reviewDate":"November 5, 2016","reviewText":"Love being able to select the right temp for the tea I want!

It also has various settings for types of tea. A design flas is that when it has reached temp and you take it off the stand to pour, then replace it on the stand, the kettle automatically starts to heat again (even if there is no water in it) -- removing it from the stand does not turn it off. You have to hit start twice to turn it off.

We have had this kettle for a little less than three years and it has completely broken down.\nFirst off, the handle is not terribly comfortable to hold or pour with. The labels wore off the buttons within the first few months. The lid broke after the first year, no longer opening with the push button. Now the lid is held in place with duct tape.\nAbout a year ago the kettle would intermittently cut out, reset the temp setting and generally behave erratically.\nI kind of disliked it from early on because it was awkward to hold and pour, now that it is so unreliable it only works once every other try or so, I am looking forward to getting something simpler and more ergonomic.\nIf you need a variable temp kettle, you may as well buy a cheaper version as you will have to replace this one before too long anyway."},{"reviewerName":"swede","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Perfect temp","reviewDate":"January 27, 2014","reviewText":"I was looking for a way to heat water to a desired temperture to make tea.

I was eager to get this pot so that:\n\n1) I didn't have to wait as long to pour up my tea on those days I forget to come downstairs and put the kettle on before I get in the shower, and\n2) If I turn this one on before getting in the shower, it should keep the water warm till I'm ready for it without the annoying tea kettle whistle.\n\nWell goal #1 is a complete bust. I measured 1.5L of cold water from my tap using the CPK, then poured it into my copper kettle. Then I added another 1.5L to the CPK. I pressed Boil on the CPK, then turned the gas burner on and pressed Start on the CPK simultaneously. I started my kitchen timer and waited.\n\nThe copper kettle on the gas stove whistled at 6:30, +/- 3 seconds. The CPK took a full minute longer, reaching a boil at around 7:30. It didn't beep and switch to warm mode until 7:46. (Test was performed at about 300' above sea level.)\n\nI was quite surprised, not to mention disappointed. So I waited a while until both kettles had cooled off and repeated the test. The results were identical to within just a few seconds.\n\nDespite my disappointment, here are a couple of other quick pros and cons:\nPro: Large spout pours quickly.\nPro: Easy to fill through spout - don't even have to open lid.\nPro: Easy to operate the buttons and seems like quality construction.\nPro: I overfilled it a little, but it still didn't boil over. I probably had about 1.9L. The water level was still on the indicator, not above it.\n\nCon: Although the first 95% of the water comes out quickly, the last 5% takes forever and streams out in three or four different directions.\nCon: The fill indicator is difficult to see behind the handle.\n\nSadly, I'm probably sending it back."},{"reviewerName":"Oliver Ehlers","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"5***** love it","reviewDate":"August 4, 2015","reviewText":"5***** love it, will buy more, excellent product"},{"reviewerName":"Mike79","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Awsome.","reviewDate":"September 29, 2014","reviewText":"High tech, my wife and friends love it.

The temperature settings on this kettle are open to question. The \"boil\" function is accurate; the water boils. But the lower temperature settings seem to be lower than advertised. For the green tea setting of 170 degrees, my cooking thermometer said the water had been heated to only 155 degrees. Since I brew green tea, I tried the other settings and found that 190 degrees gave me 170 degrees for my tea. So that's what I use. Is my cooking thermometer right or the tea kettle? I don't know, but I had a second cooking thermometer that agreed with the first, so I'm betting the kettle is off. I give it four stars because I'm happy making this adjustment and the water heats quickly as advertised. 190 seems to produce 170 pretty consistently. And the reheat function works. Have used it now for two months. The lower settings seem to work well for hot chocolate."},{"reviewerName":"Faculty","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Why put plastic in a stainless steel kettle?","reviewDate":"April 8, 2011","reviewText":"We bought this kettle as it advertised a stainless steel interior and we don't like our water to boil inside plastic. However, the spout contains both a removable plastic filter and a non-removable holster to hold the filter. This means that your boiling water always passes through nasty smelling plastic each time you pour. Horrible. Also, the kettle has no insulation, so you'll burn your hand on the exterior if you touch it after it has boiled. If the kettle was better insulated the 30-minute \"Keep Warm\" feature wouldn't need to use as much electricity. In fact, we have turned off the \"Keep Warm\" feature as having a kettle with a super-hot exterior sitting on the counter for 30-minutes is bound to end up in a burnt hand one day."},{"reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great fast kettle","reviewDate":"December 29, 2010","reviewText":"Great kettle.

Scott Souchock","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great Concept, Flawed Execution","reviewDate":"February 12, 2013","reviewText":"Let me say upfront that the product works to heat the water at the various temperatures. I am taking it on faith that the temperature is correct. And the controls are easy to use.\n\nWhy I have rated it so poorly has to do with form. First, the balance is wrong. You have to hold the handle in the middle or just slightly above and it is awkward. Because of the control point the handle gets thicker where it meets the body and make it impossible to get my hand in there for the balance to feel right. Perhaps if the kettle is two feet from the sink you might be ok but I have to carry it a long way down the hall at my office where I intended to use this kettle and when full of water you have to hold it with two hands, one hand on the bottom. My home kettle (another brand) does not suffer this imbalance.\n\nMy second complaint is the lid, it's small. Related to the lid is is the filter tab, it's very large. So combined with the small opening at top and the filter tab the fill area is restricted. Filling from a sink is ok but not ideal. Filling from a jug of water as I intend very soon would be more challenging.\n\nThe first complaint is why I have chosen to, hopefully, return this one and I have ordered a multi-temp version of the brand which I have at home. If you're young and strong this would be an ok problem I suppose. But if you're older or not a strong in the arms I would definitely avoid it. Even for me with my strength I just find it annoying. Perhaps I am spoiled by, in my opinion, the better design of the kettle I have at home.\n\nGenerally I would say the Cuisinart, in my somewhat limited experience, makes a pretty good product. It's just that this product is not one of them."},{"reviewerName":"Harvey Johnson","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"cordless electric kettle","reviewDate":"January 29, 2012","reviewText":"The kettle works very good and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for an appliance to control the temp. of water for tea.

What would make this better is if the cord had a way to retract itself into the base."},{"reviewerName":"Yukie Schmitz","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"It broke after one month I purchased this item.","reviewDate":"June 6, 2014","reviewText":"We used it very rightly.

When there is plenty of water in the kettle, the water pours out reasonably well. However, when the kettle has less than 1 cup capacity left, water does not pour out easily nor smoothly. When finally water comes out, it does so like a clogged up shower head, splattering water all over, outside my cup and left a lot on the table... messy. For the asking price, I expect this product to perform close to perfection.\n\nI reluctantly returned it after a few days.\nCuisinart is a good brand. I chose it because of its brand name.

If it stinks of hot plastic and does not switch off when the water is boiling, all those \"oolong\" and \"french press\" temperature settings are useless.\n\nOr maybe I just got a lemon?\n\n[Same day, 9 Jun 2011, evening] It spewed its last portion of poisonous vapor and died. Buttons light up when I press \"boil\" and \"start,\" but it does not heat water. Why this costs $100? My first cassette player which I bought in 1987 for $99.99 in 1987 dollars still works!

I've yet to contact Cuisinart, but based on the other reviews I am not hopeful. Not to mention this is the third Cuisinart appliance that has broken in less than a year.

I certainly wouldn't get it again. It looks nice, and the blue glow is pleasing enough, but for what it is and seeing people struggle with it, nahhh.\n\nIt comes down to poor design, not the functionality of being able to change the temperature of water. For an old tea-bag like myself, I have to wonder whether the designers actually ever used it to make something as simple as a cup of tea.\n\nOnce the kettle has more than a teaspoon of water in it, people tend to hold the handle much higher up due to the displaced weight and the required manipulation, combined with wrist strength when holding it in the middle or lower end. You won't want to hold it near the bottom, it's hot, and that makes for a burny-burny boo-boo.\n\nHaving over 30 years experience of kettle manipulation for lots of \"cuppas\" (tea), the weight balance is very poor. I can cope, but my wife, her mother, her father, and any visitor (welcome or not) clearly struggles to not hold the handle at the top when it's not near empty. And guess what? The top is where all the temperature and keep warm buttons are. I.e. anyone that isn't the spawn of Xena and Hercules is going to constantly be crushing the buttons while they move or use the kettle. Which means putting it back on its phallic charger base protuberance with undesired settings EVERY TIME!\n\nThe actually container shape is also complete rubbish. When it contains plenty of water, the pour is fine and consistant, but as the water depletes, the water doesn't pool sensibly inside when poured. The top is thinner that the rest, this creates a reservoir of water below the regular pour-line. Bionic individuals can anticipate what's going to happen and react the femtosecond in question, but puny mortal humans will discover a 0.00001° change in inclination at this point will transform the escaping water from the mere dribble to a torrential deluge shaming Niagara, and over-filling the desired live in the mug.\n\ntl;dr: it boils water, it's ergonomically challenged.

The only thing that I was looking for was that it was primarily stainless steel on the inside (minimal amounts of plastic or rubber). On that note, this kettle did fine. There is a small rubber piece (presumably where the temperature control feedback thermocouple is), and then the plastic on the back that displays the volume of water. There is also a bit of plastic near the spout, but that doesn't touch the water until you pour. The temperature control is nice, and it holds ample water.\n\nHere is my disappointment: If you only heat up one person's worth of water (~8oz), you cannot pour the water cleanly. The first time I poured water out, probably 1/3 of the water missed my cup. Note that this is not a lack of hand-eye coordination, but a poor design. The small piece of plastic near the spout somehow prevents water from exiting cleanly. It ends up coming out of the edges of the spout. This does not seem to be a problem when you fill the kettle full - only when you fill up a small amount (1 serving) of water. In order to avoid spilling now, I have to pour tremendously slow (10 seconds per 8 oz cup).\n\nWill I return it -- probably not. I usually feel bad about returning used equipment that still functions. That said, if I had to purchase again, I would buy a different product. The temperature control is nice, but not worth the difficulty in pouring."},{"reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Four Stars","reviewDate":"December 3, 2016","reviewText":"Great product easy to use."},{"reviewerName":"Dell Cooper","rating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Mine also stopped working after 14 months.","reviewDate":"February 24, 2014","reviewText":"The unit is nice but 14 months is not a long time to use an appliance.

I filter my water, but flourine is good for your teeth and flourine & chlorine kill algae. While you can't filter out one without the other, they both off-gas with heat.

This stainless steel kettle was about twice the price of the other one, which was plastic. I had had a plastic electric kettle for seven years and was very happy with it, so I thought I would try one again due to the very good price. (The Philips ordered in 2003 is no longer available). I would also try this one because of the high rating and many features.\n\nThe plastic kettle had higher wattage and did boil the same amount of water about 30 seconds faster, but this kettle wasn't far behind. It was really a tough choice because both kettles had good features the other one didn't necessarily have. Unfortunately, they are both a bit heavy - especially when filled - and both their exteriors get hot, but I guess that is to be expected.\n\nUltimately I chose the stainless. It is very quiet and emits no unpleasant smell or taste. It had lots of features I didn't have to have, but I am enjoying very much: settings for different types of tea, pretty blue l.e.d. indicators, and a pleasant beeping sound that indicates the water is ready."},{"reviewerName":"Amaya guerrero","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Save your money and buy this one rather than does ...","reviewDate":"October 5, 2017","reviewText":"Save your money and buy this one rather than does fancy do berthing touch thing it will safe you time and money"},{"reviewerName":"Stephan Drechsler","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Five Stars","reviewDate":"July 11, 2014","reviewText":"very good, highly recommended"},{"reviewerName":"Jaime Pla","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Hi Teck","reviewDate":"January 15, 2013","reviewText":"The best way to buy, just click and save $$$$$$ from your home, iPhone, any time .

I never could replace my original, beloved Philips and bought a Krups as an alternative. The Krups failed after two years, which was ridiculous! I then tried an Aroma, but returned it to Target because of the terrible oily smell and taste I could never remove (after more than a month). While I do not need all the different temperature settings on the Cuisinart, I do like the \"Keep Warm\" setting.\n\nThere is no bad smell or taste, and the kettle performs as it should. It is a little pricey, but I was at a loss for options. A good buy if you can spend the money, particularly if you are a tea aficionado and need your water heated to different specifications.\n\n***************************************\n\nUPDATE: I am on my second one of these.

I really wanted this kettle, but I'm not paying $90.00 for a kettle with a visible discolored mark smack on the front of the kettle. Cuisinart placed an adhesive sticker (2.5\"x4.5\") on the front of the kettle to highlight some product features. The sticker is supposed to be removed before you use the kettle. When I removed the sticker (both times), it left a dark discolored mark where the sticker had been affixed to the kettle.\nI would love to try this kettle, but I don't want to look at a brand new product with a large discolored mark on the front. Sorry Cuisinart, you are screwing this one up. The really silly thing is that the kettle comes wrapped in plastic, the instruction booklet is wrapped in plastic, the cord and base is wrapped in plastic. Maybe some bright person at the manufacturing plant could think of placing this sticker (which is meant to be thrown away) ON THE PLASTIC and not on the kettle where it ruins the beautiful stainless steel.\nI've called Cuisinart twice and they don't really seem to care. I've told the customer service rep to pass on the message not to place stickers right on the product. I'm not hopeful things will change.\nThe kettle might be good, but I didn't even try it.

I also owned Tefal before, and liked it as well. This Cusinart kettle has a lot of bells and whistles, but is not simple and convenient enough to do the best what is supposed to do - to boil water. The 'Start' button is quite small. I also found that it was hard to see the water level when the kettle was off. Basically, we put this kettle away and took out our white Tefal kettle back (despite the fact that it does not match our stainless steel appliances).

I mostly drink black tea so don't often use the lower temperature controls, though they have been nice to have a couple of times. So, why four and not five stars? It just failed a couple of days ago. I don't recall when we purchased it, but my love tells me it is less than a year old.\n\nShort story: Keep your receipt attached to your product manual so you can return this product if it fails within three years. Do not fill out the registration card as it is for marketing and privacy invasion. Product support does not have access to the information and it does not help you if you need a warranty repair or return.\n\nLong Story:\n\nCuisinart customer service just said to me that the registration card is for marketing and they do not have access to the information I already gave the company, so they had to go through taking all my information and use the serial-number to confirm it was still under the warranty. The product manual says, \"We suggest you complete and return the enclosed product registration card promptly to facilitate verification of the date of original purchase.\"\n\nThey have printed a lie. Customer support, managing the return process, does not have access to this information. The warranty card has nothing to do with your warranty, so do not fill it out or bother to register on-line. Just keep your receipt and product manual.\n\nSecond issue. They did try to charge me $15 for shipping and handling. The product manual says, \"California residents may also, according to their preference, return nonconforming products directly to Cuisinart for repair, or if necessary, replacement, by calling our Consumer Service Center toll-free at 1-800-726-0190. Cuisinart will be responsible for the cost of the repair, replacement, and shipping and handling for such products under warranty.\"\n\nWhen I protested they pretended to look-up something and said it was an \"Early warning product...\" so I would not have to pay shipping and handling. I believe it is actually California law that says they are fully responsible for the failure of their products. No one anywhere should have to pay any cost of return for a product under warranty. That cost is built into the price of the product when you purchase it and an incentive manufacturers to not skimp on quality.\n\nEvangalizing:\nI recommend that if you live outside of California you start contacting your elected representatives and demand they adopt a law that requires manufacturers that sell products in your state to support you when the product fails. Things that fail within warranty ought to be repaired or replaced without charging you for it. If this does not include all the costs of doing the repair/replace (including shipping both ways) then they just use failed products to take your money when it fails, gives companies incentive to make low quality products, and shifts quality control to the consumer making your life harder."},{"reviewerName":"Hanne Olesen","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Nice design","reviewDate":"November 24, 2014","reviewText":"Nice design, but had ordered the wrong one.

The water heats quickly to the desired temperature. In addition to heating cups of water for tea, I also use it to quickly bring water to a boil for cooking pasta, etc. I love being able to heat the water to specific temperatures for different types of tea, and this was the main reason I selected this kettle.\n\nWhile I was also looking for a stay-warm feature, I now find that I hardly ever use it. The water retains its heat for long periods anyway, so I usually find it is easier to just quickly reboil the water when I'm ready for more than to keep it heating for a half-hour straight. I think this feature will be much more useful for entertaining.\n\nAs some people have noticed, this kettle is pretty loud when boiling water. I use another electric kettle at work (also Cuisinart) which is quieter, as is my good-old-fashioned stove-top kettle. I find it's louder when boiling smaller quantities of water, but I still love the kettle. This is just a heads up.\n\nOne other small annoyance is that the water level guide fills slowly, so if you're trying to be precise you have to pour slowly, pause, and wait for the guide to catch up. I'm assuming it is designed this way so most of your boiling water isn't touching the plastic guide, which is nice, just something to be aware of.\n\nOverall, this is a fantastic kettle which is absolutely worth adding to your kitchen!\n\nUPDATE: I've been using this kettle multiple times a day for nearly a year and I still love it. As some others have mentioned the text rubs off on the most used buttons. I've found this mostly happens if you touch them when your fingers are wet.

As tea is the most commonly used drink in my household it's used every day many times. It's very solid with metal construction and filter is not breaking up like most of cheaper versions I had before (and this was a reason I got this one). I mostly use highest temp setting for all kind of teas so that's the button I use most. It's a bit heavy but you can expect it. What I didn't expect is that labels on the kettle started to wear out in the very first year. In the next year or so the mostly used buttons practically had no labels visible. On the third or fourth year lid won't pop up when you press a button to open, you have to push it open which could be a bit tricky if your kettle is still hot from the previous use. I thought about using lubricant like wd-40 to lube it but afraid I wouldn't be able to use water from it for some time:) So unless you really need special settings for different teas simple plastic electric kettle would work as good as this one and cost much less, even considering you have to replace it every couple years. It would also much safer to a touch and easier to lift (if we have guest and kettle is full I'm usually the one who has to pour water from it as it's too heavy to do it safely for everyone else). So when I'll have to replace mine I would probably get one for under 20 bucks like I have now at work."},{"reviewerName":"Josie","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Would have loved this kettle if not for the cheesy labels on the preset buttons.","reviewDate":"February 4, 2017","reviewText":"Cuisinart still has not updated and fixed the problem with the Set Temp labels??? HUH? Yes, what a surprise that such a nice item still hasn't been redesigned since the time I bought mine nearly 7 years ago. Doesn't Cuisinart know that this is a great tea kettle with just one, easy to fix flaw. If only. The labels for the presets all wore off within one year of ownership. I did use a premanent ink marker to fix but that wore off again after a year. So the spring load mechanism in the lid finally broke and it won't open unless I pry it open with a fork. Time to find a better mouse trap. To replace it, I looked and looked for something that had the same features and maybe improved upon the label problem. And what did I find, but a great kettle at half the price of the Cuisinart. Yeah, it's not quite as nicely built, but I like the design way better. My best kettle in the past was a very inexpensive Krups which lived on and on. Sometimes the aesthetic build quality becomes less important to you if the item can't deliver on functionality. So this time I purchased the Gourmia GDK340 (btw, never heard of this company before). It's not flashy like the higher end GDK380, but it's a bargain price, half the price of this Cuisinart. Added bonus, Gourmia uses a glass bowl so I can see from across the room if I need to add more water. So far I really prefer the Gourmia to the Cuisinart.

Bad call on my part. Here's what went wrong with my 6-month old teapot, from someone who's been using electric teapots since they were invented:\n\nThis teapot is incredibly noisy, and became progressively more noisy as time went on; in fact, became noisy to the point that one day I thought my neighbor was at it again with his leaf blower early in the morning. I realized as I took out the garbage the other day, that I can hear this teapot some 200 feet away! The other problem is that the numbers wore off the push butons, so I no longer have any idea what temperature I set. It doesn't matter if it's \"programmable\" if you can't see the numbers.\n\nWhen I called Cuisinart it was apparent that they were familiar with both problems, as the customer service representative asked, \"Like the howling of a wolf, right?\" With regard to the numbers disappearing, she suggested that maybe I used a strong citrus-based cleaner to clean the pot, which I did not. (Forget that it's the numbers I use most often that wore away, it must be the detergent, sayeth them.) They offered to replace the pot---despite none of these issues being my fault---but only if I paid a 15-buck return shipping fee, plus shipping it to Cuisinart. Heck, I might as well buy another teapot!\n\nI can assure you this time it won't be a Cuisinart!\n\nA followup: I stand by my negative review of this item, but here's a very positive one for BED BATH AND BEYOND. Before throwing the kettle away---or shipping it back to Cuisinart to pay their ransom, which they jokingly call a warranty---I stopped by BB&B just for the heck of it. They were more than happy to replace it with a brandy-new one and ship the old one back to Cuisinart. What a terrific store! I was in and out of there in less than 10 minutes!

It will burn your hands. It's a nice shiny metal appliance, but very hot water is on the other side, and metal conducts heat very well. Don't brush up against the sides or you will get burned.\n\n2. The design is not practical and I seriously doubt was ever tested by a human being who actually used it for its intended purpose. If you fill up the kettle, the awful design of the handle means that you either burn your knuckles (see #1 above) trying to hold the handle to balance the kettle, or you hold the handle too far down to be comfortable, and possibly needing two hands.\n\n3. It's full of LEDs, but they're not useful. If you sometimes make hot water early in the morning and don't turn on the lights so as not to wake anyone, you would hope all of the LEDs lighting this thing up would be helpful. Unfortunately the numbers and text printed on each button are not backlit, which means you're blinded by lights around each button and can't see which button is for which temperature.\n\n4. It's awkward to fill. The lid is made of metal and has a button to release it. But when you push the button, it only releases about 45 degrees. When it's cold it's not a problem to open the rest up with your fingers, but sometimes I add more water when I need more even if there is a little hot steamy water inside.

I spent $20 at UPS and sent the kettle back to them on a Wednesday. They received it the following Tuesday and Friday afternoon of the same week I had my replacement. It is brand new and even included the documentation. It works perfectly and I couldn't be happier. All in all, this kettle is a winner. Read below for my original review.\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\nI have very much enjoyed this variable temp water kettle for almost 3 years. I received it as a gift in Feb 2014. I read the reviews stating the lettering on the buttons had work off for some people, and have been careful about how I pick up the kettle making sure I don't rest my hand on the buttons. So for me, the temperature buttons on the handle have never work off in the slightest. The handle is actually designed for your hand to be placed below the buttons when picking it up so that's never bothered me at all. I drink white, green and black tea mostly, and the temp difference (especially for the green and white teas) makes a HUGE difference in the tea flavor. About 5-6 weeks ago, I noticed the kettle when set to heat to 200 degrees would bring the water to a full boil. I tested the other temps using a digital thermometer, and only the lower 2 temps ( 160 and 175) were accurate. The other 4 higher temps heated the water to 15 - 20 degrees higher than the called for temperature. I was going to live with that but then the kettle starting boiling the water and never shutting off. I figured that was a hazard: would it boil itself dry and catch fire? I didn't want to find out, so I called Cuisinart support (manufacturer warranty is 3 years). They were extremely helpful and quick and are replacing the kettle with a new one. My cost is the $20 to ship them the defective kettle. So far, so good.\nAssuming the replacement process goes as planned and the replacement kettle lasts as long as this one did, I can say I've been thrilled with the product.

(Updated)","reviewDate":"July 19, 2012","reviewText":"I bought the first one at Sur la Table, but they only had one, and it was an open box unit. Took home and alas, wouldn't get over 80 degrees. Still had stickers on it and everything, so I wasn't sure if someone else had returned it for the same issue. I returned the unit the same day to a very apologetic Sur La Table employee. It all worked out okay because I received a 20% off coupon from Bed, Bath, Beyond and discovered that it would be valid for this item (and is $99.99 retail at their store), so I figured it would be in my best interest to secure it for much less than offered on Amazon, even with my free Prime shipping. (Also of note: their coupon works for Breville brand items as well - including juicers!) Not trying to send people to other retailers, but just saying... usually Amazon blows away even sale and coupon prices, but not in this instance.\n\nThe unit is so easy to use. I brew a lot of tea and I have quite a variety. I also brew a lot of French press coffee. This unit takes the guesswork out of heating the water to specific temperatures. I was actually using a water thermometer clipped to the side of my pot to heat water to the correct temp. Only problem is that I have to watch it. And if I want a refill I have to repeat the process. This carafe eliminates the hassle and is just a major convenience.\n\nThe settings seem to be accurate. I have measure the temperature with my water thermometer and it's within a degree or two when it's done warming. The unit lights up when it is heating, so it's nice to know when it's on. The carafe is stainless steel, which is a huge plus. Many other units have plastic parts. There is a plastic piece holding a mesh strainer, but you can remove it. The plastic is BPA free though. But the strainer confuses me since I only brew water in the carafe and the mesh is not so fine as to trap small particulates. Perhaps if one put in a charcoal filter in that insert (I think Cuisinart sells them), then the filter would work properly, but would likely cool the water down as it filtered through. I prefer to pour filtered water from the faucet or from the Brita pitcher instead.\n\nSo far the unit has been working great (the second one that is). I will update if anything changes. I know that Cuisinart has inconsistency with their products. I have a small food processor that has been great for years, but bought a larger one that stopped working within two weeks. So I'll keep everyone posted. But so far so good.\n\nUpdate (8/17/2012):\n\nStill works great. Temperatures are all VERY accurate, within 1 degree using my manual water thermometer to test. One small issue is that cleaning it is a pain. There are instructions for removal of water stains. But when the unit is hot, I hold it over the sink and try and get all the excess water out, then let it sit out with the lid off on top of my stove (so the moisture goes into the hood vent and does NOT create Oregon mold). But you can't really wipe it out when the inside is 160 - 200 degrees. =) My only minor quibble, but it is very minor. Note: when holding upside down, it seems there is a lip that catches some water, so be sure and tilt it quite a bit to get the excess out. Then you can wipe anything excess once it's cooled off a bit.\n\nOh, baking soda works for water stains and freshening. Just either put some on a paper towel with a bit of water and wipe, or soak it briefly in a diluted water/baking soda solution. Then rinse clean. It's what I do occasionally to my plastic food containers or my Nathan or Amphipod water bottles."},{"reviewerName":"S C","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"It works but don't expect it to last forever","reviewDate":"November 11, 2017","reviewText":"I've had the CPK-17 for a little over four years.

It's bad for my eyes. The numbers and letters rubbed off the handle after a few months. I don't think I ever cleaned the handle--it just rubbed off from being grasped.\n\n2. It's bad for conversation. This thing is loud. Not boiling-kettle-on-the-stove loud or doing-dishes-in-the-sink loud or even window-air-conditioner loud. Almost-vacuum-cleaner loud. All conversation stops before tea.\n\n3. It's hungry for attention. If I empty the pot, it beeps furiously until I put more water in. I've learned to unplug it after pouring.\n\n4. It has anger issues. It is capable of boiling exactly 1.7 liters, and not a drop more. If I add so much as an extra drop, it hisses and spits with rage. It hasn't seriously burned me, but whenever an unsuspecting guest fills it, it ends up spitting a couple of feet.\n\n5. It's needy. Since the gauge in the handle has a sort of built-in time delay, filling it to almost-but-no-more-than-1.7 liters is next to impossible. I have to rest it on a level counter and wait for the gauge to stabilize to read how much is in there. And it can only be read in a brightly lit kitchen. (See #1.)\n\n6. It's incontinent. After almost two years the seal around the handle seems to have aged on the inside of the pot. When I kept finding water running down the cabinets near it, I assumed I must have overfilled it, but now the handle leaks slowly and constantly, even when unplugged and cool.\n\n7. It's bad for my marriage. My wife bought me this pot, and for a long time, I pretended to like it. This sort of deception is bad for a relationship.\n\nOk, I want to say some nice things about it:\n\n1. It never actually caught fire.\n\n2. For two years it boiled water.\n\nI know two comparable pots at the office, and neither of them irritates me in any of these seven ways. The CPK-17 and I are just not right for each other."},{"reviewerName":"Cathleen Coulter","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"You will see rust occur inside on the bottom plate.

Then, to add insult to injury, when you pour the heated water into your cup, some of the water sprays onto your countertop. Tries really hard to ruin your cup of tea, this device does.

One star removed for minor issues.","reviewDate":"December 15, 2013","reviewText":"I am a tea drinker and this has great features. If you don't know why you would need all these settings, they you don't need this kettle. (A darjeeling from full boil can be bitter and overly astringent, but at 200 or even below it's not). So it fits a need for me nicely. I've been using it for a couple months.\nPro:\n-The spec sheet is accurate and it's great for all the reasons other people have listed.\n-I used my iDevices iGrill Grilling/Cooking Barbecue Thermometer with Dual Probe, White to verify the temp settings. All were consistently within +- 2 degrees F (beeped and turned off 2 degrees before listed temp, and then settled down 1-2 degrees higher on the \"keep warm\" mode).\nCon:\n-Execution/assembly issues- the screw on the lid fell off in the pot and needed to be fished out and reattached. For the price, I would have expected a slightly more robust \"feel\" to it; I get my general impression is that this will need to be replaced in a couple years under heavy use (which it gets at 3-4 times a day).\n-The pour spout design isn't flawless. With or without the \"scale filter\" in place, water can splash when you get to the end of water in the pot. So fill higher than you need.\n-Takes a little longer to get water to a full boil than my \"one setting\" Aroma AWK-115S Hot H20 X-Press 1-1/2-Liter Cordless Water Kettle. So I actually use both now- the Aroma for preheating boiling water for cooking (faster and cheaper than going cold to boil on the stove) or to pre-heat my teapot, and the Cuisinart for the tea itself.\n-I prefer the \"keep warm\" feature off, but after sitting for a while I think it turns itself back on. Minor issue but irritating.\n-----------------\nUpdate 12/21/13\nI've since bought another electric kettle for work but didn't want to spend the $$ for this one. I got the Oster variable for $40 at Target. It allows for temp at 10 degrees (so doesn't dial in the preferred tea levels quite as well), and it doesn't have the keep warm feature- but at half the price it makes me almost want to take another star off the Cuisinart for being so expensive.\n-----------------\nUpdate 03/24/15\nThe Oster variable died.

Convenient, beautiful cool looking, light in weight, not loud, cool blue lights, very easy to use, buttons easy to press, way more convenient buttons on handle than on Breville variable temperature model, which are on base of unit. However, the inside has plastic parts that come into contact with water, which raises health concerns with plastic parts and silicone seals leaching chemicals into the boiling water. To reduce plastic parts, we removed the removable filter, but still the water front window, heating element and a few others remain inside and make contact with the boiling water. 5 starts for ease of use, convenience, aesthetics and functionality. 1 star reduced for plastic parts in contact with water.\n\nAnd while we decided to accept the great kettle even with its plastic parts (as scary as it seems), we couldn't ignore the off-putting smell that would come out of the kettle and water. It smelled metallicky - like chlorine and metal together. It was mild, but distinct. It did not go away after 2 months of use. Mild but worrisome smell, another 1/2 star removed.\n\nThe kicker: for a $100 kettle (which it was when we bought it in November)it broke in 6 weeks. It actually stopped working on Christmas day, and since all stores were closed, we had to boil water in a soup pot for tea and coffee - NOT COOL ON CHRISTMAS. It took about 1.5 weeks to get it replaced and a new one shipped out. I'm hoping it was a fluke, but seeing that the price dropped significantly (20%) from when we bought it, and the other reviews indicate high percentage of defective units, I'm guessing its a production flaw and not a random event that it broke. We liked it enough and it looks so cool and is so convenient that we're giving it another try, with the new unit, which seems even better than the first, but no way to tell whether it will continue to work and for how long.\n\nUltimately, 3 stars, as I still have hope for the replacement unit.

They take 3-5 days to respond to the email, and each time they do they are adding on questions as if they want to find a reason to stop my exchange. Then they said I can't exchange the product because it's used at a business. I never said that-I only use this at home! Then when I called customer service they said that it was impossible for the kettle to break in the way it did, that it must have been ripped off by force. I assume that all customer support people at Cuisinart must be a) mechanical engineers or b) coached to say that because I am not the Hulk and there is no way I could have ripped it off.

(We use it a couple of times per week.)\n\nWhat's not good:\nThe main gripe is that the kettle defaults to \"keep warm\" mode. This means that after the water has boiled, the kettle will boil it again, and again. Even after you pour, the kettle will reboil. You can disengage reboil mode, but sometimes you'll forget. And when you have guests, they won't know to disengage reboiling.\nIt is sad to see the print on the buttons wear off quickly.

I've found it sturdy and fairly easy to use. It has not come up when I lift the kettle, and it grips my countertop well.\n\nIf I could improve this product, I would add insulation. It is uninsulated stainless steel. That is great for weight and bulk, but you must rely on the heating element to maintain heat, rather than insulation. Also, since it is uninsulated, the outside surface (not the handle) does get HOT--far too hot to handle. However, it is a kettle, so you can expect it to get hot.

Within a matter of seconds of replacing on the base, it was rolling, bubbling and shaking on the base. I took it off for two minutes to reset the memory. When I put it back, it immediately went back to rolling. I then took it off the base and unplugged it for about 15 minutes.

After having a few panic-inducing moments having stepped out of the kitchen to complete a task and returning to the kitchen to see the tea kettle boiling on the gas stove (one time to completely empty) after having forgotten it was on I purchased this kettle. I reviewed some of the customer pictures about the ink wearing off the buttons and decided to use a small foam painting brush to apply waterproof/heat resistant silicone very precisely onto the buttons. I removed the filter to expose the screw that seems to rust easily so I can leave the top open and let the unit dry when the container is empty. This should resolve any problems people have had in the past with the unit.

This kettle is easy to use, works flawlessly, and is a great addition to any kitchen.\n\nThis kettle has many features that put it above its competition. First of all, it is stainless steel, which always looks sleek and on top of that Cuisinart added blue LED lights as an indication that the kettle is on and working properly. It has the ability to hold close to 2 liters of water which is more than enough for a few cups of tea.\n\nThe heating element is hidden so it is perfect for dorm rooms. There is also the option to keep the water warm for up to 30 minutes. It is so convenient to just press the keep warm button, drink my tea, and then, if I want more, just pour another cup! The only complaint I have is that it is unable to go in the dishwasher. But this isn’t a big drawback because the only thing that goes in it is water, so all I have had to do is use a washcloth to wipe out the inside. And the filter is removable and washable so that is easy to take care of as well.\n\nMy favorite feature is the different temperature options. Until recently, I never knew that tea needed to be steeped at different temperatures. I like tea, but I will admit, I’m not an expert. After doing some research, I discovered that only black tea was supposed to be steeped with boiling water. Green tea always tasted bitter, but that was due to the leaves being burned by the boiling water.\n\nAfter using the green tea preset button on this kettle and making it properly, I learned green tea is one of my favorites. The temperature of the water makes all the difference in the world. And it is so easy to just press the button and the kettle does its job and heats to the perfect temperature. It will beep when it is ready and then you are just minutes away from a comforting cup of tea.\n\nOverall, this product is wonderful and I highly recommend it to everyone who loves to drink tea."},{"reviewerName":"IZ","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"I Really Like It","reviewDate":"March 10, 2012","reviewText":"Works just like it says it does, and I have no complaints other than one, which is what keeps it from getting a fifth star. Pouring out the last few ounces of water is a pain. I use this mostly for a french press, and usually I just heat a large mug's worth of water at a time- which means I want ALL that water out when it's done. It starts off pouring smoothly, but when you get to the last quarter cup, you have to tilt it quite a bit to get it to pour the last bit out, and it comes out disjointed- not one steady stream of water. I popped the filter out to see if it helps with the stream, but without much luck. You just have to be patient and hold it almost upside down for a bit to get it all out.\n\nBut overall, it's great. A definite recommend because it's fast and efficient. Makes my soup-making so much easier, quicker and less wasteful of energy too.\n\nUPDATE: I'm upgrading this review to 5 stars, because it's nearly 3 years later, and this thing still works like it did the day I bought it.

I'm working at my desk for hours and want a constant supply of my tea! I do use the different temperatures for the different types of tea that I drink and have noticed a difference in flavor.

We found this completely unacceptable for a kettle which my mother used for less than a month. We paid a lot of money for a nice gift, and when the product failed the manufacturer refused to take responsibility.\n\nThank god for Amazon. I called them and told them about the manufacturer's less than helpful return policy. Amazon said no problem, they would replace the item for us at absolutely no cost to us. Amazon also gave us free one-day shipping on the replacement item- unlike the manufacturer, who told us the replacement kettle we would have to pay over the odds shipping in order to receive wouldn't arrive for 7 to 10 business days. Amazon really went above and beyond to help us, especially when the problem wasn't their fault at all and didn't have to be their responsibility.\n\nI hope the replacement kettle works out.

I bought this kettle because I liked the idea of being able to boil water at different temperatures for different teas such as black, green, white etc. A problem that I found almost immediately was the Open button. On the kettle I bought this button worked fine while the kettle was still cold, it would open the top lid to allow the kettle to be filled with water, however the problem arose after the water was heated. At this point if you tried pressing the Open button to add more water for instance, the button would not so easily open the top lid. After boiling water I would have to press the Open button 4, 5 or 6 times before it would work again. I'm thinking the heat & steam inside the kettle was somehow keeping the lid too tightly closed and in addition to this issue, I did not feel the kettle was good quality. No doubt about it, Cuisinart missed the mark on this one! After quickly returning the item, I made another kettle purchase (T-fal Thermovision). This kettle offers the same choice of different water temperatures for different teas and is much superior quality, great looking also.

It has a \"male\" centerpost that fits into the base of the kettle. This takes getting used to; you can't just drag the kettle off the base the way you would the carafe of a drip coffee maker, for instance. You must lift the kettle up off the base. It's a minor complaint, I know, but I've dragged the base across the counter on more than a few occasions. I'll learn.\n\n- I wish there were an \"Off\" button.

I drink french press and tea, she drinks chemex coffee. We also wanted something that could be toted around the house without being anchored by a cord on the kettle itself. This kettle has surpassed all of those expectations. Be advised that the base is still corded, so if you want to reheat, you will have to place the kettle back on the corded base.\n\nWe live in an area where the water is pretty soft, so we don't have scaling issues. If you live in a hard water table, you will have to take care to remove any scaling on a regular basis, as with any device that heats water.\n\nI love that it has a temp setting for whatever beverage type you desire, and it maintains that heat level until you are ready to dispense. The water level is easy to read and it gives an audible beep when the temp has been reached.\n\nMy biggest complaint about this product is that the lettering on the buttons wears easily. The Start button is now completely blank, as is the Keep Warm button. They were faded after only a month of use. Embossing them would have made more sense, but by that time, their use was second nature anyway. That being said, this makes the product finish seem shoddy, and more attention should have been given to the buttons' durability over time.\n\nIf you are willing to maintain this kettle and don't mind the lettering coming off the buttons as you use it: I think this kettle is a great value for the sheer number of temperature ranges it can achieve and maintain, and its overall aesthetic."},{"reviewerName":"Pamela Fields","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great Kettle!","reviewDate":"January 7, 2019","reviewText":"Bought as a birthday present, I've heard nothing but great things about this kettle.

It has now been in daily use for about nine months, and by \"daily use\" I mean that I'm using it anywhere from two to four times a day for multiple infusions of loose leaf tea, and I couldn't be happier with it. It heats the water quickly and accurately, and has enough capacity that I can heat my little 2.5 cup teapot with hot water, drain it, fill it again to infuse my tea, and have enough hot water left over to jump start my oatmeal. The fact that the hot water isn't in contact with any plastic is also lovely; even when I've gone out of town over the weekend and accidentally left water in it, there hasn't been a hint of plastic smell or rust. Speaking of accidents, the automatic shut off and dry boil prevention are a blessing for the scatterbrained, and have probably prevented me from burning my house down more times than I care to admit. My only caveat is this: if you live at a high altitude and set it to \"boil,\" it will keep trying to heat your water for several minutes after you can hear it boiling away in there, because it's trying to get it to 212º, which is rather impractical at 5000 ft unless you're using a pressure cooker.

Cons: temp settings literally wear off the buttons within short amount of time, reliability/longevity issue. Cuisinart used to be the go to brand for me and I would pay a bit more for the quality it offered. However, paying more for this kettle and having the paint rub off the temp buttons very quickly was very disappointing. First one died after about a year and a half and I got another right away. Again, paint rubbed off buttons quickly. And the final clincher: second one died after just over a year again. I am currently looking for another brand, probably the Kitchen Aid kettle. I may just go to my warehouse store and get one for a quarter of the price that they will gladly replace if anything goes wrong. At the price Cuisinart charges, I would expect the quality to be superior, but it is just not the case any more. Seems they are just resting on their laurels.

Easy to fill, and oh yeah- it looks great.\n\nIt seems like a bit of cash to lay out for something that \"just makes the water hot\", but this really does make the coffee and tea-making process a delight.\n\nHighly recommend."},{"reviewerName":"lizzie","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Alternative way of making your tea!!","reviewDate":"October 10, 2014","reviewText":"OK, so what the box doesn't tell you is that you can actually add the loose leaf tea into the tea maker after it heats the water to let it steep.

No complaints!","reviewDate":"July 31, 2014","reviewText":"I love this kettle! I have been using it at least once a day for a few months now. It has everything I could want in a kettle: a large capacity, fast heating times, no BPA, minimal plastic in contact with the heated water, and enough temperature settings to properly make a variety of teas and coffee. The \"keep warm\" feature isn't very important to me but it's nice to have if I temporarily forget about my water.\n\nThis item seems a bit expensive but I don't mind paying extra for a kettle with a solid-feeling construction, lots of reviews indicating its reliability, and all the features I want.\n\nSome other reviewers have complained that the lid gets hot when you heat water. To me, this is not an issue at all.

For me I would have liked a bit more design flare but it's far from bad looking. I don't like the bright blue light which stays on for 5 minutes after the kettle finishes, all Cuisinart devices seem to be following this trend including the toaster (a friend just bought the toaster and they unplug it because of the bright blue lights).\n\nI love the idea of the temperature selection though to be honest I don't think I really notice the difference! The lid is an easy to open by lightly pressing the button. The switches are a solid quality and feel good (not a plasticy or hinged press type as on others). One slight letdown is the spout pour, when nearing the last cup of water in the kettle spurts of water come off in different directions, as long as you are pouring into the cup correctly and not too near the edge it's no problem; I was surprised the design team missed this though!\n\nThe digital buttons are nice, the kettle is metal so no fear of any plastic odors, the kettle beeps when boiled (and quite quietly with a nice tone which is nice).\n\nThe price is quite high if you consider you can buy a kettle that boils water for $18. But if you have a bit of spare cash, want a good looking device, with great build quality & boils quickly (1500 watts), then this is for you."},{"reviewerName":"Sarah Jones","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Favorite kitchen appliance","reviewDate":"January 5, 2019","reviewText":"Five stars for this kettle!

I intended on buying baby items for my upcoming birth from Cuisinart but that will NOT be happening.\n\nThe point here is that I WAS loyal to this brand but that ended with this purchase. I purchased this item because I love to drink tea as does my friends when they visit and my mother. Initially, I had a stove top kettle but it by the time we were ready for the second round, the water would only be lukewarm. This kettle seemed perfect at the time since it had the “keep warm” option so I paid the $107.98 which is pretty steep for just a little but, I trusted the Cuisinart brand and was confident that the product would be of such quality it would be worth the purchase.\n\nNeedless to say, THAT was not what happened.\n\nAfter the first months use, I was initially satisfied, I even came back on Amazon and left a positive review. THEN I started having problems with the kettle and it finally stopped working. First mineral stains built up at the bottom of the kettle since I was using tap water so I bought a brush with a handle that I could stick inside to conduct the cleaning since my hands did not fit into it comfortably.\n\nThat was the first inconvenience since now I had to constantly maintain it by brush to keep the build up from happening.\n\nSecond issue, well, it finally stopped working within 4 months so I called customer services at amazon, they said I was outside the warranty period. So I called Cuisinart directly.\n\nThe representative that I spoke to told me there was a $10.00 fee to complete the exchange and I would have to return the defective product. I assumed this fee would be fully loaded meaning it included a shipping label to return the defective item and the shipment of the replacement. Initially I was upset that I have to spend another $10.00 on top of the $107 spent but I figured $10.00 was better than attempting to purchase another.\n\nWell, to my great surprise, the $10.00 additional fee was for Cuisinart to send me the replacement and the company demanded I return the defective product on my dime!\n\nI was very upset but figured, there is no point in keeping a defective product laying around so I went to the USPS and they quoted me $25.95 to return the product. Needless to say, I did not move forward with this shipment and the defective product is still in my garage.\n\nI would NOT recommend ANY Cuisinart product moving forward nor will I be replacing any of my current items with Cuisinart.\n\nI attempted to correct my initial review but Amazon would not allow me so i had to create a whole new account JUST to write this review."},{"reviewerName":"Tx","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"6 months and it died","reviewDate":"May 24, 2019","reviewText":"Woke up one morning with water all over the floor - the seal broke.

However at this price it would last and do the job we really wanted.\nFor 12 months it did, after that is began to turn off early, two months later it would heat intermittently for over 25 minutes and never boil at all. We contacted Cusinart and asked them what we should do. They said that our kettle \"was defective and still under warranty\" and we would have to send them $15 and they would send another one, also we would have to pay guaranteed insured postage on the old one and send it back.\nNow we may be living in a different realm, but if a company tells you that their product is \"defective\" and \"under warranty\" why is it that we are having to pay a considerable amount to get a working model. On writing back stating this we got a reply some time later with the standard \"Valued Customer\" saying yes under the circumstances we will waive the $15 but you pay the rest.\nThis is the third time we have had a product break down, each time we have received a replacement item in the mail, (in the case of Braun it was a much more expensive item and they just wanted us to be satisfied.\nThat is beyond anything we would expect and outstanding customer service.)\nLook on most web sites and its \"free shipping\" so why is it that an expensive \"defective\" item is going to cost the \"valued customer\" in shipping.\nWe would have thought that if we were indeed \"valued Customers\" sending a replacement item with a return shipping label would have been the thing to do.\nWe now have a \"defective\" expensive kettle, and no further customer service, which leads us to believe we were not that \"valued\" and to know we will no longer be \"customers\" of Cuisinart products in the future."},{"reviewerName":"wendy","rating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Heats quickly, quiet, vary temps are great, but doesn't last long","reviewDate":"July 26, 2014","reviewText":"This kettle was wonderful while it lasted.

That process was easy enough, but I just think that a $90 kettle should not break so soon.

It holds plenty of water to fill my travel mug and iced tea container that brews while I'm at work.\n\nKettle is easy to fill and easy to use. Since it is stainless steel it does get warm to the touch so you can only touch the handle when it is working. When full of water it tends to be bottom heavy, so it feels a little awkward when pouring. I would like to be able to put my free hand on the bottom to help me pour, but oh well, you get used to it.\n\nI have had this kettle for about 6 months now and have had no issues with how it works.

If and when ours ever dies, I'll probably just get an identical replacement so long as they're still being made."},{"reviewerName":"LDSDME1","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Absolutely wonderful electric kettle...","reviewDate":"January 6, 2017","reviewText":"Heats water in a timely manner @ the push of a button or two.

I can't even hear it and my wife can't when she's out of the kitchen. I can hear the stove and microwave just fine so I'm not deaf yet. The other is the boil setting. We live in Colorado at 5000'.

We bought this at Bed Bath & Beyond, so we were able to return it at the store for no cost. We got the same unit as a replacement. The second unit was worse than the first. Occasionally the top would open when it was heating, without us touching it. Then it started shutting off early or never shutting off, just like the first one.

First, of all it is heavy even without any water in it. And it's hard to gage how much water is in it. Second, having to press the START button to turn it off is counter-intuitive and if you don't it just keeps boiling and steaming away.

Though most recipes have been built to use only room-temp or boiling water (since those are the only temperatures to easily reach with consistency), more cutting-edge cooking as well as coffee/tea prep requires more finesse. Unless you're willing to watch the proverbial pot boil with a thermometer in hand, this is the only way to heat water on such occasions.\n\n=== Part 2: Concerns / questions raised (and/or) left unanswered by other reviews ===\n\nI won't go into detail about well-established pros and cons covered in other reviews, but I would like to make clear a few things I couldn't determine from reviews/specs before I bought mine:\n\n(\"Hot sides/surfaces\"): Yes, the sides get hot, and yes, it is startling to touch the metal outer wall when the water is hot. However, according to my IR thermometer, the surface never gets much above 130 degrees. Sure, that's hot and you should avoid contact, but for comparison many people's hot water heater is set this high and (as validated by my rather stupid intentional touch test) an accidental touch is highly unlikely to cause even a mild first-degree burn unless you actively fight the reflex to instantly pull away.\n\n(\"Construction / Material touching the water\"): True, the sidewall level indicator and the \"frame\" of the removable spout filter are made of plastic (the BPA content of which I have not conclusively proved or disproved) but the former is part of a small compartment which only a small amount of water reaches and which has very limited circulation, and the latter is removable. The entire rest of the construction that touches water is steel. Since hot water dissolves BPA from plastics, and aluminum's role in neurodegenerative disease is unclear, iron/steel and glass are pretty much the only materials I trust completely for food storage/preparation containers. In this regard, this kettle is the safest option I've found.\n\n=== Part 3: Operational test data ===\n\nAs a tea fanatic with a minimum of four kinds of tea always on hand (black, red/oolong, green, and white) and general geek, I have meticulously measured the actual temperature of the water in the kettle for the various settings. I share them here in hopes they will provide a useful operational profile for buyers interested in temperature variability. (Bear in mind that the container you pour into will greatly affect the water temperature, so remember to preheat it by filling it with hot water right before use.)\n\nButton | @ First Trigger Completed\nLabel | \"Beep\" Re-heat Re-Heat\n--------|-------- -------- ---------\n160 | 164 160 163\n175 | 180 175 178\n185 | 192 185 188\n190 | 197 191 194\n200 | 203 199 204\nBoil | 214 206 214\n\n(All temperatures are in degrees F, as registered by my probe thermometer in the top half of the water with the kettle fully-filled.)\n\n=== - ===\n\nI know this is half generally-relevant bullet points, and half geek-oriented test data, but I hope this review still has something useful for everyone."},{"reviewerName":"Brandy Stillman","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Bad Batch of Kettles?","reviewDate":"March 6, 2017","reviewText":"I have one of these kettles and I LOVE it, so much that I bought a second one for my guest house. That's when things went bad. I got the brand new one, and it had a problem it boiled and boiled until it ran out of water. I called Cuisinart and tried their troubleshooting steps to reset the kettle. Still had the problem. Cuisinart wanted to charge me for shipping both ways for a replacement of a kettle less than a week old. They said I could return it to Amazon (who has been great by the way) and so I did. I got the replacement kettle and it too had the same issue. I tried the reset on my own and the problem still existing. I called Cuisinart and they again wanted to charge me for shipping, so I turned to Amazon again. The third kettle (second replacement) arrived today and the first thing I did was plug it in and test -- SAME PROBLEM. I noticed this time when I called Cuisinart that the recent kettles all had the same serial number I verified this because I had not returned the one from last week yet (so it's not the same actual kettle).

So far, 2 out of the 3 have been used for less than 2 months and both have stopped working. After the first one turned itself off after setting it to the usual boil setting, Cuisinart's customer service told me it was a defective unit and they would replace it, with me paying for shipping, both ways, sending them a $15 check with the returned unit. The second kettle has now begun to do the same thing. It will not stay on to boil. It turns itself off after less than 2 minutes. I now have two defective kettles to return. But now I just want my money back, thank you. We still have the third kettle to try and see if it also is defective.\nUPDATE: I am very frustrated with Cuisinart's inability to not offer any type of refund for these two defective units. I do not want replacement units, and Amazon only allows for refunds before 30 days is up, and these units stopped working after about 2 months. I purchased these for $84 each. The Cuisinart customer service rep I spoke with this morning was less than helpful and actually scoffed at the fact that I could not read the tiny printed number on the bottom of the kettle without a magnifying glass. Wow, rude. So, I have two defective units that I wasted $168 on and the only thing I can do with them is toss them in the garbage.\n2nd UPDATE: Our third unit just stopped working, a day after giving the above update!! I decided to call Amazon directly to see what they could do.

Even if removed from the base; even if the 'start' button is turned off & no lights are on; the kettle still continues to boil.\nIt does not happen every time.

I am comparing this to the Brefille electric kettle: their last version has a much wider opening -- so pouring water in is much easier. AND, if you were to drop anything in the kettle (like the sediment screen, while replacing it), or if it builds up sediment at the bottom -- you could NOT reach inside the kettle! This kettle's small narrow opening at the top requires you to aim it more carefully under the stream of running water during filling (keeping the electronics/ electrical parts dry); The Brefille had an unobtrusive but musical single and quiet ding when the kettle was done boiling. This one has an unpleasant, loud beeping that can wake up my sleeping baby. The WORST part about this kettle: its lid will NOT stay closed! While boiling, the lid keeps opening wide! And I keep closing it. Repeatedly. Even as you are pouring yourself a cup of tea, the lid flies open, letting out steam! i have not burnt myself yet but I don't believe that a wide open lid on a kettle full of boiling water is safe!

Mine did so on the temperature I use the most (Black tea) within about one year or so. This isn't too bad, but if I was constantly making different temps of tea, it would be very problematic.\n\n2) The water level gauge forms a white/black crust as though it's not perfectly sealed, and there's no way to get in there and clean it.

I have tried three different brands/models, and this one is hands-down the best by far. Well made and durable, it does the job very well, heating water quickly and, optionally, keeping it at the right temperature.\nLooking through various different electric kettles, you will find that there are basically two different power types - 1,500 watts (like this one) and 1,100 watts (or thereabout). The higher wattage models will, as a rule, heat water significantly more quickly. The trade-off is that, if you have an older / less robust electrical system in your kitchen (or where-ever), running a higher wattage kettle and another high wattage appliance (microwave, toaster oven, etc.) on the same circuit at the same time, may trip the circuit breaker. An easy thing to learn to live with, but something to keep in mind. I find that this is not an issue with the \"keep warm\" feature, which only runs the heating element for about 10 seconds. Unlike other kettles I have used, this one has not started leaking over time. It does seem to have a common defect, in that the audible beep when it has reached the set temperature does not always sound. I sent my first one of these back for an exchange when I first noticed that, but the second one has the same intermittant issue. However, while not loud enough to be bothersome, the kettle does emit enough noticeable sound while heating that it is obvious when it stops.

I used to use a stove top kettle, and could count on a full pot of boiled water remaining hot for 30+ minutes after boiling. This kettle seems to cool off immediately if not kept on the Keep Warm setting. It's a minor issue, but surprising for what appears to be a well insulated kettle.

The Cuisinart is smaller than the Krups by 0.8 liter and had expanded performance abilities on paper. CONS: The lid often sticks (button is poorly designed). The exterior gets stains on it from water and they do not come off easily. The level gauge is difficult to see, while holding the pitcher, because your hand blocks the view. The control panel on the handle is TERRIBLE; it often resets itself, will put the \"keep warm\" function into play without actually punching the button, or change the temperature to 160 degrees when it was set at 212 degrees. The biggest CON is that the kettle is unreliable and unpredictable. The purpose of an automatic electric kettle is to operate when you are not watching it. Fill this kettle and turn it on, then walk away only to find it has not heated the water. I have tried standing by the kettle to see what happens and it simply signals with \"beeps\" that it is done, when it has only been heating for less than 90 seconds. This doesn't happen every time, but frequently enough that I have to now stand by the kettle to be certain it will heat. This makes me regret buying the device (never had this problem with the Krups).\nPROS: It occasionally boils water (when it feels like it). The electric pad design is reasonably functional. Aesthetically, it is pleasant to look at."},{"reviewerName":"D.

I have had it for slightly over 3 years when it started to leak onto the base for some reason and needed to be replaced. I ordered the \"newer version\" CPK-17AMZ which is identical to the CPK-17. I suspect mine had a flaw which finally failed which resulted in water leaking through the kettle walls to exit out onto the base. Out of concern for being electrocuted, we replaced it.\n\nThe kettle has heated water to the correct temperature consistently and has always been a pleasure to use. The temperature settings are great and very convenient. I use this kettle primarily to heat water for coffee which I make on an Aeropress coffee maker. Ideally, you don't want boiling water for brewing coffee as it results in a bitter brew. We make extensive use of the \"Keep Warm\" option so that we can get to making the coffee when we are ready (work and kids cause delays).\n\nI would encourage this kettle for coffee and tea enthusiasts. The temperature settings truly help achieve that perfect cup!"},{"reviewerName":"Cory","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Works great (when it works at all)","reviewDate":"May 10, 2016","reviewText":"I loved this product as long as it worked, which was not very long.

It was ranked best buy for a great operating tea pot two years in a row. I did my own checking with a digital thermometer. I ran it through all the heat settings with one liter of plain water. My thermometer has a 2% error, and with that each temp setting was only 5 degrees hotter than the setting I chose. A very consistent 5 degrees, which if you figure in my thermometer's 2% at 200 degrees, that is 4 degrees making the pot only one degree off. Or you could say my thermometer is dead on and the pot is only 2% off. Either way that is pretty darn close for a pot less than $80. It also has a very thick cord to handle the current which is very important. Too often they cheap out on the copper cord which in a high amp circuit can cause problems. One other thing to consider is that the cheaper pots us a bimetal thermal disk to shut off at one temp. My first pot was one of these types and after only a few uses the bimetal disk started to malfunction and keep the pot on far too long. This can be a fire hazard. The Cuisinart is digitally controlled and uses a solid base which also blocks the contacts so that a child can't accidently shock themselves, which my first one lacked. All in all, this is a very well built pot and doesn't look like they tried to cheap out on the important stuff. It even has two color LED lighting for the switches and water meter, at first thought it was a gimmick until I used it at night. Unless something drastically goes wrong, I would definitely recommend this pot for the tea brewer."},{"reviewerName":"multipicker","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Not Worth the Cost Due to Short Life","reviewDate":"February 8, 2017","reviewText":"I purchased this kettle in 2010. That may seem like a decent life for an electric kettle, but it has been failing for years. I have to keep the cord curved in a slight half circle to get it to work and, even then, it only works sometimes. When it works, it is a great kettle. I would use this multiple times daily for tea but I can only get it to work every few days. This has been an issue for years. Since its purchase, I have made sure that I never leave water sitting in this kettle when not being used, I only use reverse osmosis water in it, and I frequently run the kettle with RO water and some vinegar in it to keep it free of mineral buildup. I only use a damp cloth to clean the outside of the kettle and it has never been submerged. The kettle has always been on my kitchen counter so it never gets bumped around or hit, nor does the cord get bent. I am the child of an Electrical Engineer so I know how to properly care for electrical appliances. For what this kettle cost, I expected a much longer, episode-free life. I called Cuisinart's Customer Service twice and was told that I have had this kettle for years and I should not expect that long of a life from an appliance. Both reps expressed surprise that it has lasted me this long, despite it's sporadic performance. Both offered me a 20% discount off a new $100 dollar version. Cuisinart's temperature variable kettle is not inexpensive. I expect more quality from a product priced as high as this kettle is. If I am only to expect a short life from a Cuisinart product, I will not make the mistake of buying another. I bought a different temperature variable electric kettle as a gift for a family member at a fraction of the price of this Cuisinart unit, the gift kettle has all the same functions and none of the performance issues. I will replace this with an inexpensive temperature variable electric kettle."},{"reviewerName":"mac40k","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Heats water for coffee as fast as a Kuerig","reviewDate":"February 19, 2019","reviewText":"Having recently switched to grinding my own beans and using a press pot, I needed a way to heat water. When researching using a French Press, this electric kettle got great reviews. While you could use a traditional kettle/pan on the stove or heat a cup of water in the microwave, the electric kettle has distinct buttons for various temperatures, most importantly (for me) the 200 degree F setting for French Press. While it holds up to 1.7 liters of water, since I only make my coffee one cup at a time, so I just put that amount in the kettle whenever I want to make a cut, which results in the short heating time. Obviously heating more water will take longer, but for my situation, the water is nearly ready to be poured by the time I can measure and grind the beans. Okay, you still have to wait 4 minutes for the coffee to steep in the press pot, but at least you aren't waiting for the water to heat before you can start the timer. Having the water heated to the perfect temp every time (along with using a scale to measure the beans before grinding) ensures that you consistently end up with the best cup of coffee possible."},{"reviewerName":"cbclw","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Even my dad likes it!","reviewDate":"August 15, 2019","reviewText":"We purchased one a couple years ago.

But only product that yields water for teas","reviewDate":"November 14, 2014","reviewText":"UPDATE on NOV 19, 2014.\n2-star review upgraded to 3-star\n\nThe problem with the pour I mentioned in my original review can be somewhat mitigated by completely removing the mesh screen. This improves the pour greatly if your kettle has enough water. However, the last half pint or so of water in the kettle will still pour out in a messy, multi-stream fashion. This is due the the fixtures built into the spout to hold the mesh screen in place. This mesh screen is an example of over-engineering a solution to a little problem that ends up creating a much greater problem. It should be kept simple - like the Hamilton Beach kettle.\n\nMy makeshift fix has made this much more usable so I've upgraded the rating from 2 to 3.\n\n-----------------------------\nORIGINAL REVIEW 2-stars\n\nI also own this Hamilton Beach 40882E Stainless Steel 7.2-Cup Kettle:\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Hamilton-Beach-40882E-Stainless-7-2-Cup/dp/B004XJWQZQ/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1415988475&sr=8-3&keywords=electric+kettle+hamilton\n\nThis Cuisinart kettle is better than the Hamilton in three regards:\n1. The Cuisinart has multiple temperature settings\n2. The Cuisinart can maintain your water at one of the set temperatures\n3. The Cuisinart has a nicer closing mechanism (it requires just a light touch)\n\nBut in every other regard, the Hamilton Beach is superior. Here are a few of the important ones:\n1. The Hamilton won't burn you if touched by accident. The Cuisinart either is not insulated at all or has poor insulation. Several members of my family (me included) have accidentally burned ourselves when our hands brushed against the Cuisinart. This NEVER happens with the Hamilton. The Cuisinart requires caution that is inconvenient in comparison.\n2. The Hamilton pours MUCH better. Due to the use of a water screen filter on the spout, the Cuisinart pours miserably. It pours like 5 separate scattering streams of water in different directions when you pour water out. It's incredible that this design flaw somehow got past the product team at Cuisinart because it makes the kettle so hard to pour. The Hamilton has a straight forward, smooth pour that is expected of any Kettle. Cuisinart is just terrible at pouring and can spray water out of your mug accidentally.\n3. The Hamilton is confusing to use. When you put back the kettle onto the base after pouring out freshly heated water, the background light indicator goes blue. I have no idea what this means and the manual does not describe it either. Neither the \"STart\" nor the \"Keep warm\" button lights go on, so I'm not sure if it's keeping warm, reheating or what. It certainly doesn't look off because the blue light indicator is on. So this forces me to press the \"Start\" button to turn the \"Start\" indicator button on again, and then re-press the \"Start\" button again to shut off ALL the lights. This is the only way I can be certain the kettle is off after use and it's very inconvenient. Granted extra features add complexity, but this is still poorly thought through design that got past the product team.\n\nThere are more smaller issues but they are not substantial.\n\nHopefully either Cuisinart or a competitor comes out with an improved version of this soon."},{"reviewerName":"Lisa Loveland","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"This kettle is one of the best investments you can make in your kitchen!","reviewDate":"August 25, 2016","reviewText":"This kettle is one of the best investments you can make in your kitchen!

It does exactly what I wanted.\n\nI love the Keep Warm option. I can walk away and get back to making coffee whenever I have the time.\n\nI like the lit measurement window. I no longer have to hold it up to eye level to see how much water I am pouring into it.\n\nThe keep warm button for boiling kicks back in when the temperature dips to 200 to 203 (it varies)\n\nThe 200 degree button heats the water to 204 to 208 degrees (again, it varies) and the keep warm kicks in when it dips to 200 to 203 degrees.\n\nThe other buttons do likewise, e.g. subtract 10 from each number and that is what the 190 button does.\n\nThe 200 button is perfect for coffee. Ideally the water should never reach boiling in order to keep the air in the water and one should use water between 195 and 205 degrees.\n\nThe thermostat stops at the same temperatures if you start cold or hot (unlike my smaller Adagio Teas 3 UtiliTEA Variable-Temperature 30-Ounce Electric Kettle)\n\nIt takes about 5.5 minutes to get 1.5L of cold water up to 195 degrees and about 7 min to get to boiling (actually 6.5, but it takes another 30 seconds before it dings).\n\nI did not anticipate the lack of ounce markings, so I put notations in permanent marker on light tack masking tape for 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54. Why 6 oz intervals? The standard for coffee is 10g per 6oz cup and that is how my grinder dispenses itBreville BCG800XL Smart Grinder, so 6oz markings work best for me.\n\nIt is difficult to see the water level at 12oz and impossible for less than that amount.\n\nI was a little annoyed at the lack of a dedicated OFF button. You turn it off by pushing the START button again (or taking the pot off the charging stand), but this one-button method has a downside. If you are like me and only pour into it the exact amount of water you want and always empty it... You need to turn it off BEFORE you pick it up off the stand because once the pot is put back on empty and begins to heat up again, a safety mechanism kicks in and it just blinks and beeps until you either keep it off the stand or put cold water into it and wait a minute for it to click.\n\nThere is a piece of plastic attached behind the screen at the pour spout to keep tea bags inside the pot I suppose. It effectively stops the water from exiting gracefully from the kettle from the spout near the end of the pour. When the pot is not quite empty, it starts to comes out in several different streams and always traps some of the water so I have to re-pour several times if I do not want to leave any water in the pot to leave behind mineral deposits. There is a nut holding it place. It is difficult to do so, but I finally managed to use a socket wrench to remove the nut and the plastic, so all is well now.\n\nIt has an interesting method to keep the water away from the plastic level gauge. The interior is all stainless steel except for a bulb near the bottom which lets water into the measurement window. Since you are not looking at the main body of water directly (like you do with a measuring cup). The delay is a bit odd at first and it does gets steamed up, but it does work and it limits exposure of the water to the plastic during heating."},{"reviewerName":"Tyler Forge","rating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Poor attention to detail","reviewDate":"February 25, 2017","reviewText":"This kettle has two major fails - both related to cleaning.\n\nFirstly - the top opening is too small to fit my medium sized man hand into.

So easy to get hot water, with optional temps! Prior: Glad I got this. Only used two days, happy so far! Just fill, press the temp you want, start. Literally less than 3 minutes to heat up. 1L was under 2 mins to 160. So the Pro's are: the SS looks nice, sits stable on the heat plate, cordless serving, no spill spout. A low, blue light is on while heating , easy push button to start. When done, three low chimes tell you it's done. This is very low and will not wake the sleeping spouse. FYI: the cord is short. 12 to 15 inches short. You must put base near an outlet. There is some plastic, inside, due to it having a mesh filter at the pour spout. I think most people filter water before filling the tea kettle, so it does not do much. But I also think it's low contact with your water, during a few seconds of pouring. Having control over the temperature is great. It's accurate. I tested first pot to 160, my household meat thermometer said same. Con: Only one, you cannot easily clean the inside.

Now on occasion when I plug it in it won't tun on. When it does turn on, it will shut off mid boil cycle. Sometimes it will come back on after several minutes, sometimes it won't for far longer. On the rare times it gets to temperature, it sometimes will only beep once and shut off where before it would beep 3 times.

I descale it with vinegar, keep it clean, and baby it, but it didn't matter. Seeing other recent reviews this is a pattern and I hope the Cuisinart takes responsibility for this.

I expected it to be a brand-new product that someone simply changed their mind about and returned.

Very pleased with that. I've just had it a month now, but kettle functions perfectly so far.\n\nThe only con for me is the ergonomics of the handle - despite having fairly large hands, I cannot reach the Open button while holding the kettle mid-air; I have to set it down on the counter to reach the button that opens the lid.

Easily my husband and I go through 4 individual 6 cup pots each a day. From greens, to herbals, to yerba mate, to black, and then decaffeinated for the evening, it was tough to find a kettle that could keep up with everything we drink all day long that was within our price range.\n\nThere is plastic on the level indicator which was off putting for me at first but honestly it is difficult to find any kettle that doesn't have any bit of plastic in it. Because of the other people's reviews stating that the inside area when the screw is will rust after a year or so, we unplug and wipe it down in the evening and leave the lid up. While this might not totally prevent that, we figure that it will help to fully dry it every night and it honestly just takes a second out of our day.\n\nIt's not noisy. It heats within 5 degrees of the stated temp. I do like my tea a bit more cool then the temperatures that are on the buttons (I like my white teas at 165, blacks at 185, etc) but it really isn't that big of a hassle. Although we've only had it about a month and a half, we've used it 10 times each of those days without any problems.

There is a one-year warranty which I did have to rely on, with the unit failing just one week shy of that anniversary. I called Amazon which put me in touch with Cuisinart. They replaced the unit after I mailed the defective one back. My only issue was having had to pay for the return shipping. The new unit has lasted beyond another year after continual use. My son has since moved out to college and taken the kettle with him, which leaves me searching for a new one.

Polaski","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"So far, so good","reviewDate":"May 16, 2012","reviewText":"I ordered this kettle a couple of days ago to replace a year old Krups which had unexpectedly started leaking badly. I chose Cuisinart because I had previous good experience with a Cuisinart electric kettle and owned it for 15 years with no issues. Personally, I don't think I really need quite so many temperature options, however, it may be useful for other things besides tea. Off hand, I can think of bread baking where I need water at a certain temperature to proof yeast. Also, my husband doesn't like tea and coffee as hot as I do, so he will probably appreciate being able to select the temperature.\n\nSo, the kettle arrived today, via Prime shipping, with all the appropriate parts and such. There was an odd plastic/metal smell to the pot, but I rinsed everything according to the directions and then filled it with clean, cold water and set it to boil (212 degrees). I didn't find the water level indicator difficult to read, but my husband did. The lavender/blue light is a very nice touch, but truly serves no useful purpose. The kettle was easy to turn on (select the temperature button, and then hit \"start\") and was not at all noisy while it boiled. I was sitting in my office while it boiled and did not hear the \"ding\" to say it was done. I emptied the water, refilled it with clean, cold water and reboiled it. Again, I didn't hear the \"ding\", but that's not really a huge problem for me, given that this kettle has a \"keep warm\" feature. Once the second pot finished boiling, I set it up again to boil to actually make tea and stood over it while it worked. It only took a few minutes to heat up, was very quiet and seems efficient. The lid does get some condensation on the outside from the steam -- no big deal, just use common sense and keep your hands away while it's boiling. The outside does get warm, too warm to touch comfortably for any length of time -- it's a kettle. The purpose is to boil water, of course it's going to get warm. I made my tea, and was very pleased to note that there was no plastic smell or taste to the water. So far, I'm very happy with this and will update the review as necessary.\n\nUPDATE 09/06/12 -- kettle is still going strong! No scaling that I can see in the bottom and the thing gets a lot of use. I recently felt very comfortable buying some loose green tea because I had a kettle that would brew it at the appropriate temperature. No leaks yet. So far, this is a winner!\n\nUPDATE 04/07/13 -- the kettle is almost a year old, gets used on a \"several times daily\" basis and is still going strong. I have on a couple of occasions forgotten to fill it with water before hitting \"start\" (I thought there was enough water in it), but it will shut itself down if it's dry. That has more to do with my forgetfulness and busy-ness than anything wrong with the kettle. The labeling on the buttons is starting to wear down a little, but you can still read what they say, and if it gets really bad, I'll just paint it on. I would definitely recommend this kettle to anyone who asks (and have done),and I'm looking forward to the next 10 years or so.\n\nUPDATE 01/25/16 -- Wow, it's been almost 4 years already?! Time flies. The kettle is still amazing, but it is starting to show some wear and tear consistent with regular use. The \"212 (Black Tea)\" button has no lettering on it at all, it has all worn off. No big deal, since I know which button it is. The lettering on the water level indicator has pretty much worn off as well, so the fact that it lights up really helps me to see how full the kettle is. There are no cracks or scratches or any other issues in the body of the kettle to worry about. The only thing that seems to be failing is the \"ding\". Sometimes the kettle will \"ding\" when it has boiled, sometimes it won't. Again, it's not a big deal because of the keep warm feature and the fact that I generally remember that I've put the kettle on and should go check on it. Still very happy with it and when the time comes to replace this one, I'll replace it with the exact same model.\n\nUPDATE 04/07/18: Well, it finally died on me, after 6 years. It's a very sad day in my house, but I will replace it with the same model."},{"reviewerName":"Jess","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Okay, could use some design improvements","reviewDate":"January 30, 2016","reviewText":"This works well and is pretty easy to use.

After a week of use, here are my initial thoughts:\n\nPROS:\nThe base has a slim profile and takes up little space on the counter;\nThe electrical cord length can be adjusted under the base to avoid extra slack;\nThe water level markers are convenient if you want to fill water to a specific amount without the need to boil more water than necessary, which takes longer;\nWater boils fairly quickly and accurately based on the taste of my French pressed coffee.\n\nCONS:\nThe body of the kettle and lid are not insulated so this gets very hot to touch, which is a big letdown compared to some competitors;\nAlthough I was aware there is no digital readout of the water temperature, I found myself missing it when checking the heating progress or even the current water temperature after filling or sitting for a period of time;\nWish the opening was bigger to fit my hand inside to hand dry;\nI'm not a huge fan of the rubber push buttons but that may not matter to some people. Although they work completely fine right now, my experience has shown that these types of buttons require more force over time and that the printing will wear out.\n\nI won't list it as a con since it's my fault, but the kettle did fall off my counter after I propped it up to dry up-side-down and the spout dented in while gouging our hardwood floor.

It sort of seemed redundant. I had a perfectly good kettle that I would put right on the stovetop and that was that. My husband, however, thought this was a great appliance. He saw what this kettle was capable of when they bought two for his office. He convinced me to at least give it a try.\n\nOne of the main reasons I gave in to try was because I felt that if this was as good of a kettle as was claimed, I would buy one for my dad. He's getting up there in years and he's forgotten he had things on the stove and they burned, including his kettle. I love that this is electric and it turns off automatically after a while. I also love that fact that there are so many temperature options. I just recently started drinking all sorts of tea and with this temperature function, my teas have come out quite well, and not overly brewed like they were with my regular kettle. (No more bitter green tea). Lastly, not only did I feel it was safer for my dad to use, but my children as well (don't worry, I still help them pour so they won't get burned), but I still like that they are not dealing with the stove and can now make their own hot chocolate and teas if they want to.\n\nSo far, I have been really happy with the performance of this kettle. It does just what it says it will do. It is easy to use, I like the lights so that you can see you have pushed the right button. I love that you can see the water reservoir so you know just how much water you are putting in. I also like that it really keeps the water warm for quite a while and will even keep your water heated to the correct temp. if you use that function. Frankly, I just like the basic function of it heating the water to the correct temperature.\n\nSome cons: First is the price. I still feel it's a little much for basically what I feel is a fancy electric kettle. It is what it is I supposed. There are some electric kettles out there that are less expensive, but knowing that my husband's office uses two of these almost constantly, showed me that it's a hardy appliance and will stand up to use. Second, I noticed that I already have staining...it almost looks like rusting in the bottom of the kettle. We have very pretty hard water, so I expected it, but I guess I was surprised that it happened so fast. It still works fine, and doesn't effect the taste of the water so I guess it's more of a cosmetic issue for us. Not really a con, but more of a wait and see type of thing is what many other reviewers have written and that it stops heating up the water after only about a year? THAT does not sit well with me, but a lot of those were earlier reviews and I hope Cuisinart has fixed that problem.\n\nOverall, I am happy with this Cuisinart Kettle, how it's performed, how it looks, and everything it does. I just bought another one for my dad's place. He used it more than we did when he was staying with us for the winter. I feel safer knowing he's using this instead of a regular kettle. I'd give this more of a 4 1/2 stars if that were an option."},{"reviewerName":"MossyFernForest","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Super fun luxurious kettle, plastic inside the only drawback","reviewDate":"February 28, 2016","reviewText":"I love this kettle! It is so awesome to use this after using my previous stovetop kettle. It is quick to heat, taking only a minute or two for a full pot, and I love that you can adjust the temperature. The only thing I dock a star for is the plastic inside that is in place to hold the removable filter. That plastic can't be removed, but if I keep the water level below it, then the only plastic the water touches is the water gauge. They are hard plastics which they say are bpa free, so I'm sure they aren't that bad, still I'd prefer that no plastics come in contact with my morning tea and I hope that cuisineart and other companies with be moving in that direction according to consumer demand and opening awareness regarding the materials that come into contact with our food especially.

We've had it just over a year. The temperature control choices, ease of use, and reliability have been perfect. I read the one review re: the rusty screws. If we're not using our kettle, we don't leave water in it. While it's still hot, we empty whatever little bit of water may be left, and then we leave the lid up until the kettle has completely dried and cooled. Whether or not this is the reason we've had no rust problem, I do not know. I agree the response by Cuisanart's customer service department was poor. Anyway, so far, all is well with our kettle."},{"reviewerName":"Jeffrey Chandler","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Perfect coffee and tea companion!","reviewDate":"January 2, 2013","reviewText":"::::: BACKGROUND :::::\n\nAfter years of having really bad coffee and tea, I started to educate myself. While there are SO many elements that go into a good cup of joe/tea, one of the biggest and most overlooked issues is brewing temperature. I have and use both a Chemex Coffee Maker 8 Cup Classic for pour-over coffee (the best method I've ever used) and a Teavana Perfect TeaMaker for teas. Both require pouring water through the top.\n\nFor the longest time, I used a tea kettle for all of my water-heating needs. Then I thought I wanted an inexpensive electric kettle, one that just heats until boiling and then shuts off (I'm not sure why, that wouldn't have done anything differently). But then I realized that I really need precise temperature control; a different temperature for every kind of tea and coffee is different still. That's when the Cuisinart came into view.\n\n::::: PERFORMANCE :::::\n\nThe kettle heats very quickly. It's really nice that the heating element is actually in the base of the unit, shaving off a cord and weight from the kettle itself. While I haven't double-checked the temperature to see how accurate it is, I must say that I have noticed a drastic difference in taste with all but black tea (which should be brewed at boiling anyway). My whole life I thought I hated green tea and I couldn't figure out why oolong from a Chinese restaurant tasted so much better than at home. The brewing temperature!\n\n::::: BUILD :::::\n\nThis has a very nice, strong build and looks very handsome on the counter. At first I thought the blue light on the water level window and buttons looked tacky, but now I rather like it. The \"stainless\" steel exterior is incredibly vulnerable to smudges and fingerprints, to the point that some marks seem to be permanently on there, no matter how hard I scrub. The lid has some sort of spring mechanism and opens very smoothly. There's also a removable screen in the spout that seems kind of silly to me; it could only filter very large particules, larger than anyone would have in their source water. Seems kind of pointless to me!\n\n::::: ERGONOMICS :::::\n\nThe handle has pretty good placement, balancing the weight of the water quite nicely, allowing a nice, even pour. The spout also gives a nice, steady stream. The streamlined base is really nice and includes the heating element and single cord.\n\n::::: OPTIONS :::::\n\nThe temperature selections are pretty convenient; that IS the point of this product. In a perfect world, this would be a variable selector, allowing you to dial in the exact temperature, but I'm guessing that would be more costly. Each button not only has a prescribed temperature, but a suggested substance to brew with that water. For example, I most frequently use 200º French Press, which really should just say \"Coffee\". Coffee is optimally brewed at 195-205º, so this preset is spot-on.\n\nThe keep warm function works really nicely for me. In the case of brewing coffee via Chemex, you need to pour over rather slowly, as to not flood and underexpose the grounds. Periodically placing the kettle back on the base instantly heats the water right back to 200º and I'm good to go.\n\n::::: OVERALL :::::\n\nAll in all, I'm very happy with this kettle. It's a great brand, is nice looking, free of BPA, and offers convenient and (at least relatively) accurate presets. Most importantly, it helps me brew all of my favorite beverages at the proper temperature, yielding a VERY noticeably better drink. Though it's relatively expensive, its very worth it to me! Highly recommended!\n\n::::: COFFEE SETUP :::::\n\nJust as an extra plug, I use this as a part of my perfect-coffee trio:\n- Cuisinart CPK-17 PerfecTemp 1.7-Liter Stainless Steel Cordless Electric Kettle\n- Bodum Bistro Electric Burr Coffee Grinder, Black\n- Chemex Coffee Maker 8 Cup Classic\nI've never had a better cup than what this makes!"},{"reviewerName":"DebbieC1953","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Nice if not perfect","reviewDate":"October 18, 2015","reviewText":"I have only just received this and am happy with the shipping and packaging. It's a little smaller than I had imagined, but it's fine and actually takes a little less space on my counter than the old electric kettle it is replacing while holding the same amount (1.7L). I did a lot of research and expected to get a glass kettle this time, but many reviews steered me away from them and towards a stainless steel one, and this was the best of the those I researched. It has many temp settings that I don't really need (as yet) not being a tea drinker, so I just use it on boil. I'd prefer that it would have that as a default setting but it's no big deal to push that button and then the Start button. It does heat up quickly and the water level window lights up in blue. If I designed it, the window would be bigger and not underneath the handle - just easier to read from across the room. With the handle facing you, you can't see the water level. I also find it a little unwieldy and unbalanced when picking up a full kettle - it's not a perfect design and I felt the need to grab it with my other hand. It pours nicely and the Keep Warm feature is nice. I'm pleased, and hope it lasts - the old one, a plastic Merlita, was over 10 years old!

The numbers tend to wear off, which is fine, you can still use it if you remember what they were, which we did, and then the lid stopped opening so we had to fill it through the spout, which is fine, it still functions. But we like it enough to have purchased our second one when the first one wore out so badly it was rendered useless. I utilize the different temperatures all the time. Black tea at boiling, coffee at 200, and green tea/chamomile tea at 175 are the main ones we use. It is fast and efficient and works great...at least in the beginning :) It's also big and heavy, but we don't mind that too much."},{"reviewerName":"James","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Works but temperature doesn't control well","reviewDate":"March 14, 2016","reviewText":"It heats up very quickly, so it serves my purposes well. I tested the device with a thermocouple, however, and it seems to always heat to roughly 10-20 degrees F below where the setpoint should be. If you want 195F water you will get 170F. Other than that, it seems to do its job well. I purchased an extended protection on the device because I've seen so many get rusted, but I haven't had mine long enough to see any rust.\n\nAnother minor complaint is that there is no OFF button. Once it's finished warming the water, I have to set it somewhere else to cool down instead of set it back on the plate, otherwise it will start to heat up again and freak out when there's no water (or unplug it). Why no off button?!"},{"reviewerName":"jenn","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Not accurate enough for science experiments, but makes a great cup of tea! ;)","reviewDate":"August 8, 2014","reviewText":"Love this kettle. I understand from other reviewers that I should expect the writing on the buttons to wear off sooner than I would like, but I am willing to live with that for the plus of having multiple buttons preset for my teas and the stainless steel \"innards\". As to that, the interior is nearly 100% stainless steel. The only places that are not are the area around the little hole near the bottom that lets water into the window area so you can tell how full the pot is, the underside of the lid, and the tab that holds the filter screen. The water-level window is BPA free per the manufacturer, but it is nice to know that most of my water is not touching it as it boils away. As to the lid and the screen tab, these only touch the steam in the kettle, not the water. Granted the steam can condense and fall back into the pot, but this does not seem to cause an off-flavor that I can identify. As to accuracy, I'd say it is good enough. I have tested it at full boil and at the Green Tea setting of 175 degrees. I'm at 5600 feet, so full boil here is 204 degrees not 212. The pot is clearly confused by this and wants to keep working to get the temperature up. However, it shuts itself off after a minute, then a minute later it tries again, boiling the water away. Since it has an automatic \"boil dry\" shutoff, I am not worried about this issue, but I will keep and eye on it when it is set at the Black Tea (boil) setting. When tested at the green tea setting, I noticed the water was always heated about three to five degrees past the set temperature (it took 1.7 liters of 67 degree water to 178 degrees in 6 minutes, and 7 minutes to get to full boil). When the water cools to one degree below its set point, it turns on the heat again and heats the water up to 178 again. In two cases, it went up to 180 degrees. I don't find this a problem though, because as soon as you pour the water into a cup, even a pre-heated cup (using the hot water in t he pot), it always cools down three to five degrees (I tested this too!). So, it is the perfect temperature IF it is overheated in the pot. Finally, the beep. It beeps when it reaches temperature, but it is a very soft beep.... kind of like hearing a truck back up way down the street from you when you have all your windows closed. Easy not to notice if you are in another room. I'm good with that too, as I have excellent hearing, and if I miss the cue it automatically keeps the water warm for 30 minutes anyway.

The features are great. But an important part of a product is reliability, and when a product fails, whether the company stands behind the product and is easy to work with on replacement/repair is essential. On that count, Cuisinart fails big-time.\n\nMy kettle stopped working about 3 weeks ago. After pressing the START button, it would appear to be working for about a minute, would beep four times - not the three beeps you expect when it reaches temp - and then shut off (all lights go out). So, being well within the 3 yr. warranty, (and living in Calif., where we don't need to pay for shipping to return an item for warranty repair/replacement), I called the toll-free number in the instruction booklet.\n\nAfter going through the regular script of \"did you check this, did you do that?\" we got around to returning my unit to them and getting a replacement sent to me. Well, the replacement is on \"back-order\"... Amazon and everywhere else has them in stock, but Cuisinart doesn't, and they can't tell me when they might be getting them back in stock. Okay. So we move on to returning the dead unit to them.\n\nThey wanted to issue a call tag for UPS to show up at my door at some random time on some random day (totally not going to work for me), so I asked instead to have a label emailed to me so I could drop it off at a UPS Store which is more convenient. Sure. They take down and we confirm all my info over the phone. I was told they \"would send an email.\" Great. (No mention of how long it might take to get the email, but I'm assuming a few hours. This is 2014, after all.)\n\nAfter 3 days, no email. I called again. They asked if I'd checked my spam folder. Yup, done it already, not there. They said they'd sent it, but would send it again. Waited 6 days this time. Still nothing.\n\nCalled again. Same routine. Still nothing.\n\nCalled this morning. Was told I should allow 3-5 business days for the email to go out... was told that previous reps had \"lied to me\" (exact words) about how long it might take to set up the service tag, send out emails, etc. That even 3-5 business days was a little too optimistic.\n\nI told them I had gone through this several times already, and asked to speak to a manager... well, they put me on hold for several minutes and come back and inform me that's going to be impossible, the \"the person who knows how to do that\" has just stepped out. They're (supposedly) sending an email in 3-5 business days hence (saying it was impossible to put a rush on it or push it through whatever incredibly stupid system they've created).\n\nSo, here I am, waiting (as I have for the past 3 weeks) for them to do whatever it is that they do that takes 3-5 business days to send out an email, thinking that this time will be different. I know that fits the definition of insanity, but that's what happens when you deal with Cuisinart warranty service. They will drive you insane. And you're stuck with a broken appliance and very little hope of ever getting it replaced. And when it is replaced, after a few months, will I be faced with this frustration all over again?\n\nSo, yeah. One star ... it would be zero if that were possible.\n\nUPDATE (6/18/2014): Just hours after submitting the above, UPS delivered the replacement. The replacement kettle that just this morning, when I was on the phone with Cuisinart customer service, was \"still on back-order/out-of-stock\". Astounding, the technological ineptitude which this company displays. They have no idea what's what going on or how to do the simplest \"customer service\" things. The replacement unit appears to be actually \"new\" but it does also appear to be less carefully made than its predecessor... comparing them side-by-side, there are a number of fairly rough/sharp spots on the inner part of the new handle (poor plastic molding or lack of finishing work), the new buttons look cheaper (almost like they're going to fall off), etc. I've fired it up and it appears to work okay. So, now, I'll wait a few days to see if they ever get around to sending me an email with a label for UPS, and make sure this replacement isn't a total dud. And then call. And then, when they start to inform me once again that the replacement is \"still on back-order/out-of-stock\", I'll correct them. Someday, I'll get a return label... maybe. And then they'll get their defective product back. At some point, however, I will give up on this process, as I've long ago given up on Cuisinart as a brand... because they've wasted much too much of my time."},{"reviewerName":"Thomas R.

It takes a couple of days to figure out the buttons and in which sequence to push them to for example shut it completely off etc...but we are glad to have that functionality back in the kitchen.

For example , if the \"Keep warm\" button is on together with the \" boil\" button, you may think the \"start\" button is on as well. It may be off, in which case nothing happens until you realize the mistake..I still give it 4 star just because of the lack of any good alternative kettles.."},{"reviewerName":"K1ppYsGrL","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Can't live without","reviewDate":"December 6, 2012","reviewText":"Greatest invention ever! I'm a big tea drinker, and I love to drink many different fancy teas, green and oolong and regular black tea. This kettle is sooo easy it makes making the PERFECT cup of tea in matter of a couple minutes a breeze. I love the different temp settings, as you CANNOT boil water or overheat water for green and oolong tea otherwise you create a bitterness to the tea. From setting it to the exact tea temp and then time the tea for being in the water to 3 minutes you have yourself the ideal tea that tastes just as it should. The kettle heats fast and beeps when reaches temp, you can also keep it on a warm setting to keep your water warm for more cups. This is actually my second kettle as the first one shorted out or something, but I loved it so much I couldn't live without, so returning it was easy and it was replaced with no charge. This time I learned not to leave the kettle on when there is no water or very little water inside and I also try not to keep the heat setting on after I reached the temp desired, but either turn it off and unplug or set to the warm setting. If you don't do this the water will continue to come up to temperature and I'm not sure if that may have caused the issue I had with the first kettle. Also note the side of the kettle gets very hot and will burn your fingers so don't touch!"},{"reviewerName":"DHofs","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Terrific Tea -- two years and counting","reviewDate":"June 16, 2013","reviewText":"UPDATE: October 30, 2017\n\nWell, almost exactly 5 years to the day I bought it, my Cuisinart electric tea kettle finally bit the dust. In the last couple of months, it seems to have been catching water in the base area, and then when I'd pour hot water into a mug, some water would leak out the bottom of the pitcher from the seam where the base meets the sidewall. I wasn't sure if it was from boiling over because I filled it too high, or if something had cracked on the inside where I couldn't see. Finally today, when I tried to get it to operate, it warmed slightly but then shut itself off and wouldn't boil the water. I am assuming that this is a protection mechanism probably to help me avoid a fire. Regardless, I was very happy with this product, I used it multiple times each day when I was home, and I enjoyed the multiple temperature options. I would periodically use a sharpie marker to indicate the temp gauges on the handle for guests who might use it because the printing had long ago worn off from simple use.\n\nUPDATE: December 2014\n\nI have been using this tea kettle for two years, several times (5?) each day, practically every day. It's shows no sign of burning out, and it still looks great. The printing has worn away from almost all of the buttons, but as I use this so often, I have all the temperature settings memorized. However, I can see that being something worth fixing going forward. (=\n\n*******************\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW: As of this writing (June 2013), I have been using this tea kettle for 7 months, every day, several times a day, save for a few weeks away here and there. I drink tea all day long, and I work from home. I was a tad leery before making this purchase because some people had complained about the tea kettle burning out. Thus far, I have not had this issue at all.\n\nI LOVE that I can set the relevant temperature for the tea I want to brew. Mostly I brew black teas in the morning, but I then switch to milder ones as the day turns later. It didn't take long for the \"boil\" (hottest) button to become illegible, which is about the only \"bad\" thing I have to say about this product. I'm not sure how I could have prevented the printing from wearing away from the most-used buttons, other than using some kind of plastic glove, but other than that, I am extremely pleased with this product.\n\nI was initially intrigued about the \"warm\" button, which promised to keep the water at the proper temp for 30 minutes, which means that it will start heating it up again all by itself. I didn't actually like that, and so I now never have that function selected. I sometimes take longer than 30 minutes to drink a large cup, and when I go back, it's quick enough to simply reheat the water again anyway, so instead of wearing out the heating element, I'd rather just do that manually myself.\n\nIt's easy to clean, it looks sleek, I love the illuminated buttons, and it's a lot nicer than the several basic versions of electronic tea kettles I'd had in the past in Germany. I will never go back to a traditional tea pot on the stove. These are so much faster to heat up, and now with the precise temperature controls, it almost seems barbaric to think back to when I used one!"},{"reviewerName":"Catherine Owen","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"\"You aren't going to like this at first because it's something else that plugs ...","reviewDate":"January 15, 2015","reviewText":"Edit, from the son: this thing is fine... when it works.

It’s always been treated with care and left on the counter. The replacement lasted 2 years, but now I’m out of the warranty period because it’s based on the original purchase date. What a piece of crap.\n\nMy son bought one of these and told me, \"You aren't going to like this at first because it's something else that plugs in, but after you try it you'll love it.\" He was right. I got to take the whistling teakettle off the stovetop and I gained a burner!

Although the high price is definitely intimidating, I am joyous every time I use this kettle. I was wishing to put a tea station into my bedroom and wanted something that would quickly but efficiently heat my water. This is efficient, brews tea to just the right temperature, and is safe. For any tea lover such as myself, you know that different teas have different brewing temperatures-- both to reduce bitterness as well as fully extract the flavour from the tea leaves. This kettle does just that! As for safety features, my favourites are that you can refill the kettle with cool water even if it's still hot, auto shut off if there's not enough water, and shut off after 30 minutes of no use. Additionally, it'll maintain your water's temperature for 30 minutes.\n\nOther features I love include:\nNo spill spout\nCan touch bottom and handle without getting burnt\nTeapot swivels on its base\nLarge water capacity\n\nAlthough I normally see at least one con in a product, this is one case where I don't.

It is very efficient and heats water faster than my old stovetop kettle with a nice 3-beep chime when done. It also has boil off protection, a 30 minute keep warm setting and sleep mode when not in use.\n\nAs avid tea drinkers we use the kettle every day and after 5 months it is still going strong. We love that it is so fast and easy to use and makes water at the perfect temperature for that perfect cup of tea! It really brings out the flavor of tea when you use the right temperature for the type of tea, ranging from a more delicate white or green tea to a stronger oolong or black tea. We also make home brewed beer and this has been a great tool for quickly heating water to the right temperature for the mash and sparging steps!"},{"reviewerName":"Albert Karel","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Excellent.

Even on chilly mornings are friends had bountiful pots of hot tea and coffee. It was all made possible by a slightly broken plastic covered electric hot pot. The thing looked ugly but made coffee and tea in a Flash. The reason, I figured, was because all electricity in France is 240 volts giving great punch to appliances such as their hot pot. When we got home I looked up this one and ordered it. To my surprise and after careful timing, I found it made up beautiful hot water almost as quickly as the European model. And you can choose your temperature. The exact temp you need for your type of coffee or tea. And when the water gets to that temperature it maintains it.

The esthetics, handle ergonomics, and temperature variability is what caused us to purchase another one after our first one failed after just 2 years of use.\n\nThe most pathetic failure (and first disappointment) was the labels vanishing on the buttons (temp) from simple finger pressing. It wasn't like we scrubbed it will a brillo pad and bleach or something. Just basic use. The next thing was the lid hinge mechanism warped to the point that it was barely functional. Finally, the kettle refused to heat water altogether.\n\nWe considering getting the more costly Breville BKE820XL offering but it was hard to swallow given the aesthetic shortcomings. Functionally speaking, not sure how I feel about the controls on the base of the kettle rather than where one's thumb could easily dial in temp on the handle. The lid hinge opens lid slowly (awesome but given what happened to the metal Cuisinart version I'm not sure how this would wear over time?). The water level on the left and right of the carafe also makes more sense. Cuisinart probably placed their water level window behind the handle as an aesthetic choice.\n\nHere's to hoping that Cuisinart at least has solved the disappearing button labels issue."},{"reviewerName":"M C","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"The company does not stand behind its products","reviewDate":"September 22, 2013","reviewText":"The basics:\nThe kettle itself is ok.

It is fast (much faster than my stove) and I like being able to set the perfect temperature for every cup of tea. Cuisinart seems to have some production quality issues, and I am still disappointed that they don't stand behind their products better, but based on the reviews of the other kettles out there, this isn't unique to Cuisinart.\n\nOriginal review: I read the reviews on the various electric kettles and between the mostly positive reviews and my satisfaction with other Cuisinart products, I made my purchase.\n\nI loved it for the first week and a half; we used it every day. Then it just stopped working. The back-lighting for the water level comes on but none of the other lights come on and none of the buttons work. I tried to \"reboot\" the system by removing the kettle from the base for 5 minutes then replacing it. When that didn't work, I tried unplugging the unit and leaving it for an hour before plugging it back in. Neither worked.\n\nI then called Cuisinart. They informed me they would be happy to replace it - but that I would be responsible for paying shipping each way. I was disappointed by this (though I had read about it in other reviews so wasn't surprised).

Here is a quick summary of our experience:\n1) It is well made.\n2) It heats water very quickly.\n3) It holds water temperature very well.\n4) Depending on how you have it set, it shuts off immediately or holds temp for 10 minutes - even if you remove it from the base.\n5) Temperature is pretty accurate, regardless of setting.\n\nIf you make single cups of tea, instant coffee, or use a 1-cup coffee maker such as the Melitta or Aeropress, this kettle is perfect. I can make a single cup of coffee almost as fast as a Keurig, and in my opinion it tastes better. We loved it so much that we bought one for our son, who also drinks lots of coffee and tea.\n\nThe only complaint I have is that the lettering on the buttons began to wear off after only a few months. At this point, most of the buttons have almost none left. If you remember the functions, this isn't a problem, but I think it shouldn't happen.\n\nI read through most of the 1-star reviews, and we did not experience ANY of the problems mentioned. We have no rust, even though we don't keep it fastidiously clean. It has performed flawlessly, except for the button wear problem I mentioned. I wonder how many of the people with problems may have possibly used it incorrectly, such as over-filling it? Since we have had no problems, I can't speak to the customer support.\n\nIf you buy based on my recommendation, I hope that you have as good an ownership experience as we have had.

So after every usage I have to unplug it from the wall. Also, when it's plugged in, all the lights on it are always lid. It looks good, but useless. Another downside is the see through glass piece. When you pour water in it, it's really hard to see the water level inside in the room light. I always have to turn on lights in order to see the filled water level.

The way the top opens is different than the last two. It now snaps open quickly and makes a popping noise instead of opening softly. Even the one I just returned opened softly. After close examination, the product is definitely not as well made as the first one I bought in 2011. The window to see the water level is now plastic and opaque versus the old one which was clear and looked like glass. I have decided to keep it for now and see how long it lasts. I also purchased The extra 3 year warranty for an additional $6.99. The kettle went up $4 when I finally decided to buy it ($89 was my purchase price). So even with the extra warranty it came to the same price of $96 which was the selling price early March."},{"reviewerName":"Kindle Customer","rating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"The Ultimate Convenience! but it won't last!!!","reviewDate":"March 28, 2011","reviewText":"I HAVE LOWERED MY RATING FROM 5 STARS TO 2:\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW: I finally broke down and bought this kettle after pining after it for some time. It took my old Braun actually falling apart to get me to make the purchase. I wish I had bought this much sooner!! It is an awesome product and looks great on my counter top. It holds a large amount of water and heats it up fast to your desired temperature. I use a French press (uses 200 degree water temp), and an AeroPress (uses 175 degree water temp) to make coffee and I love that now I no longer have to use a thermometer to make sure I am using the right temperature water. I also make a variety of teas; green, oolong, herb and black. This thing is just so amazing at how it simplifies something so simple as heating water! LOL!! yeah, I know...some people think that heating water is a \"no brainer\" and it is. But the features on this thing make it fun and even more of a \"no brainer\"!! Also, I love the keep warm feature because now you can walk away and come back to the perfect temp water even if you get distracted by something. It is great when I have company because now I can have the 200 degree water ready for that second pot of French Press coffee when we want it!\n\nUPDATE: This only lasted one year and literally fell apart. Too bad because I really did like the convenience. I suspect, based on ratings and speaking to others, that all of the electric temp control kettles on the market are pieces of garbage.

There is no way around it. Since I don't want all this moisture to end up at the bottom of the hanging kitchen cabinet, I found the only open space: near the sink under the window.

Mine produces 160 degree F water for the 175, 185, and 190 settings.\n\nAlso echoing another complaint about the spout / filter. When the water is low, the filter seems to block it from flowing out smoothly, so you get a trickle and then as you increase the angle of the pour, suddenly an undirected splatter of hot water from near the lid.\n\nThe promise of preset water temps is great, and I'll give this model another shot by returning and ordering another unit. But I wanted to add one more word of caution to the potential buyer.\n\n(I bought the Braun WK600 back when it was about a third of the price it is now, and they got the pour right. I'm considering moving back to that kettle -- it's elegant, simple, and predictable over four years of service.)\n\nUPDATE:\n\nMy replacement unit is much closer with the presets: now instead of all of them mapping to 160degF, they each produce water about 5 degrees cooler than they claim, except for boil, which actually boils.

Well, guess what? Brewed at 175F, there was NO bitterness! It was delicious, and I'm a believer! It wasn't the tea after all, it's the temperature...who knew?\n\nIt's an attractive kettle to have on the countertop - nice blue-lit controls and fill window. Easy to fill, and I like that it has the removable filter screen, since I generally use water from a Brita pitcher, and sometimes it has little bits of carbon from the filter in it, which I'd rather not have end up in my drink.\n\nEasy to operate: just press the desired temp, then press Start.\n\nI like that it beeps when ready - though I was a little surprised at how quiet the beep is. Easy to miss. But it's ok, because the water will be kept warm for you once it's reached the preset temperature.\n\nIf you don't need it to stay warm, then you would just press the Keep Warm button and it will turn it off. The lights will then go out to show that it's off.\n\nMy one regret is that you couldn't use this kettle to heat up water to a low temperature such as you would need to bloom yeast...90 degrees or so. If it had a digital display showing the temperature as it heats, that would be one way to do it - then you could just stop it when it got to the temperature you wanted. But it's not made for that, after all, so I can't fault it for lacking that design feature."},{"reviewerName":"J. Lingle","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"The last water kettle you'll ever buy!","reviewDate":"January 12, 2011","reviewText":"After our 12 year old Revere 3.5-qt. Copper-Bottom Teakettle finally died last month, I began researching the pros and cons between stove top and electric water kettles. I had never owned an electric kettle before, but they appeared to be more energy efficient, faster heating, cooler to handle, and in most cases, more customizable. I was planning to purchase the same Revere stove top kettle until I read so many reviews stating that manufacturing had been moved to China and quality suffered as a result.\n\nThe Cuisinart PerfecTemp is expensive, but after having owned and consistently used it several times a day for over a month, I can say it's worth every penny - if you are an avid tea and coffee drinker. I use the kettle to boil water (in 4 minutes) for the kids' oatmeal before school, then I make two french press pots of coffee as soon as I get home from dropping them off. My wife has an entire cabinet filled with Traditional Medicinal teas, and between the two of us, we use the kettle at least four to six times throughout the day, every day.\n\nWith individual temperature settings for Delicate, Green, White, and Oolong teas, French Press Coffee, and Black (Boil), I have noticed a HUGE difference in the flavor of each type of tea from before, when we would always just boil water in the stove top kettle until the whistle went off. The 'beep' could be louder in my opinion, but the kettle heats water so fast that it is usually ready by the time I grab a mug and decide which tea I want, so I'm rarely out of the kitchen when it goes off. And the keep warm feature is great for deciding to have a second cup ;-). The sides of the kettle do get hot during use, but the handle is cool, so you won't need a pot holder or glove like you do with some stove top kettles.\n\nOur kitchen has been full of Cuisinart appliances for years, and although they are all generally expensive, I have no doubt that we will be using this water kettle for many years due to the solid construction and fantastic customer service we've come to expect from their products.\n\nUPDATE 08-13-2012\nAfter 18 months of using this water kettle multiple times a day for french press coffee, hot water for oatmeal, tea, etc, it has performed beautifully without a single problem. I love that it heats the water to 200 degrees for french press in just a few minutes, and the kettle remembers it's settings if placed back on the base in under 2 minutes if you've got it set to 'keep warm'. I still highly recommend this kettle."},{"reviewerName":"F.

It heats water to the perfect temperature for any type of tea. So far I've mainly used it for either black tea, every day, or green tea sometimes. It really does reach the perfect brewing temperature for each type. It's a very cool looking kettle and, unless you fill it with 1.7 litres of water, it isn't heavy. Another reviewer commented on it being heavy. Glad that didn't stop me from buying it because I love it. If you fill anything with almost 1/2 gallon of liquid it's not going to be light as a feather. It heats up right away, emits a low, subtle sound when it reaches the set temperature and looks impressive on the counter. When my son saw it he said, \"WOW, how much did that thing cost?\" For under $80 it's a wonderful addition to my kitchen arsenal. If you're a big tea drinker, treat yourself.

The one concern I had when I first saw it was how am I going to clean this out. But following manufacture instructions, whenever I want it clean, I put a little vinegar in the bottom, brought it to a boil, then bring water to a boil and dump once for a clean rinse. It works brilliantly. Practically self-cleaning.

My others worked quite well and lasted for over 3 years. This kettle has a nice array of choosing the right temperature, but most of my usage is to boil, as I make my coffee per cup. Everything works as described, but I gave it only 3 stars. The first concern is that it scales quite badly on the bottom of the kettle. So you have to use Lime-A-Way and vinegar to keep it clean almost weekly.. Even with very little scale on the bottom, it makes a lot of noise when it is boiling. I never had a kettle that scaled up so fast, and I find it to be a nuisance. Another concern is the boiling temp. I really do not believe that it reaches the 112 degree boil like it says it does, as my coffee never quite gets that cream on top from the coffee grinds. I wish they had another version of this in a shorter and a bit fatter size. I think that would cause less scaling in the bottom and probably get to the boiling heat I need. When this fails, I will not purchase another like it.\n\nNew Add On: As of today 1/21/2013 the kettle has failed after less than a year. The lights all work, but will not heat the water and automatically turns itself off. I am quite disappointed, esp. for a Cuisinart item.

It's pretty stainless steel and the blue leds are cute, nice features.

I looked at everything from 15 dollar Target brand (to replace the one I'd had for years) to the 300 dollar \"it'll steep it for you!\" kettles. I almost, ALMOST purchased the most expensive until I read some reviews and learned that the baskets that steep the tea have holes that are too large and let loose teas fall through.

Quick to heat, easy to clean, and overall nice looking.

It also feels really solidly built. A gorgeous piece of modern technology in the kitchen. You could stare at its beauty all day long.\n\nUnfortunately, we ended up returning this item because of its poor pouring action. As long as there is a lot of water leftover in the kettle, it will pour your water just fine. However, if you're down to the last cup of water in the kettle, the water doesn't pour properly anymore. It starts leaking & dribbling from all edges of the spout, and you end up making a mess all over your table. We thought that the optional filter was causing this problem, so we removed the filter and the same problem happened.\n\nYou could avoid this problem by always brewing an extra cup of water in your kettle that you're not planning on pouring out into your teacup. But for us, that just seemed like a waste of water and too much energy spent on something that should be a no-brainer.\n\n[On a completely unrelated note (and this didn't affect our review): For those wondering about the inside material of this kettle, it is MOSTLY stainless steel but there are some very tiny rubbery/plastic-y parts instead as well. I don't know the exact technical terminology for what the non-steel parts are called, but if you're concerned about plastic/rubber leaching chemicals into your hot water, it's not completely stainless steel on the inside. It's about 99% stainless steel. Although now I've been reading that even stainless steel leaches some chemicals, and that we really should only be drinking out of ceramic kettles for complete safety. Anyways, this information didn't affect our review, but I thought I would post it in case anybody was interested.]"},{"reviewerName":"observer","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"but...","reviewDate":"January 11, 2013","reviewText":"It's 2013... and it stopped working...

And I wish the cord was just a little bit longer. I get it that Cuisinart doesn't want any of us to have an accident with a long cord, but it would help me if it was 3-4 inches longer so that I could bring the kettle out from underneath the cabinets when it's on the counter.

The temperature settings are a plus, I'm an avid tea drinker and I used this kettle DAILY. Having the water reached the desired temperature is relatively quick and for the most part, quiet as well. Having the keep warm setting is really useful when you're not able to pour your water when its ready and keeps it at the temperature every couple of minutes. I've had no issue cleaning the kettle, the stainless steel makes it a bit easy for it to get a bit dirty if you're cooking around it but a few wipes here and there should clean it up. I can say for certain I've had a pleasant experience with this product and I hope you will too.\n\n**Update 10/25/2018 The Kennel still works perfectly fine and none of the print has faded away like others have happened to theirs.

I like that I can turn it on and leave it while doing other things around the house and not to worry about leaving my stove on. It will turn itself off after a few minutes. It has a couple of different settings to choose, which is nice if your picky about your tea. It needs very little maintenance. I take a cloth to the inside every once in awhile. The outside can look smudgy after awhile, but I just take some skinless steel cleaner and it shines up new. I would give it 5 stars if my first one didn't break.

I drink a lot of loose leaf ginseng oolong and there's a button for that. Or for Green, Black, White, and even French Press.

Just darn cool.\n\nI've had this kettle for almost 8 months and it works like the day I got it. I keep checking to see when it will get dirty but I guess my water is filtered right.

I do love this kettle but it does have one flaw that was obvious 2 weeks in of use. Water runs down the side of the kettle when you open the top to fill it, this water collects around the base which leads to rust at the bottom rim- NOT GOOD. you need to be careful not to let water run down the side and collect at the base or you'll rust out the bottom. The water condensate on the bottom of the lid will \"always\" run down the side of the kettle when you open the lid unless you place your finger on the lid as you hit the \"open\" button, keeping the lid from popping open. open it slowly and the condensation will run back into the kettle and not the outside of the kettle.\nThat is the only flaw I have discovered with this kettle."},{"reviewerName":"PDXbibliophile","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"... kettle to be as described by other customers and love it.

Franco","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"I like it.","reviewDate":"April 28, 2014","reviewText":"There is only one thing I use the kettle for, and that is to make Black Iced Tea in bulk. At first I thought 1.7 liters was going to be a problem, but then I realized that the amount is perfect. I make 1/2 gallon at a time using loose leaf tea, so I boil the maximum allowed level and just fill the rest of my pitcher with filtered cold water. I let the tea cool down to room temperature anyway because it is too hot to mix with ice. I'd have to use more ice to cool it down, diluting the tea which defeats the purpose. This kettle is remarkably fast and boils the tea too exactly the temperature I need, which is 212 degrees for black teas. I've read some reviews about different types of electric kettles and I found some that mentioned about the difference between plastic and stainless steel kettles. About how the plastic kettles leave a funky aftertaste after boiling the water. Now, if you're not a tea aficionado, you might not notice the difference. But I have to say that the reviews happen to be correct after experiencing it myself. I happen to have a small plastic kettle I purchased a couple of years back, and difference between that one and the Cuisinart is very noticeable. It is very important though, that you use filtered water. I mean super filtered if possible; meaning reverse osmosis and so on.\n\nOne thing I do consider to be a \"con\" would be how hot the kettle body gets to the touch and the difficulty on cleaning the kettle if you need to get your hand inside. But they're just minor problems.

It's not important, but the one thing I find puzzling is that the level markings are in liters instead of ounces.\nIt is troubling to hear that others have experienced problems with this product, but there are always a few lemons out there.

It has been perfect for heating water to 200F for coffee brewed in the Chemex, Clever Dripper or french press. My wife uses it for heating water for her tea. But the problem: a few weeks ago it started shutting off before the water was hot. We decided the \"keep warm\" feature was the problem and disengaged that button. The unit worked fine for a few weeks, but now it will not heat water at all to any temperature.

The outside of the unit also remains hot so not suitable for those with young children.\nAs there are not that many models of temperature-selection electric kettles on the US market I still gave this four stars because I use it every day and can adjust the heat of the water better than if I had a regular electric kettle and had to wait for the water to cool down.

According to my measurements the temperatures are reasonably accurate for a consumer device (within a few degrees of what the button says). the top no longer flips fully open. The labels have worn off the buttons I use most often, so now I just have to remember what they used to say. This should not happen on a $100 product.\n\nAnd the user interface is wrong: You should be able to just press the button of the temp you want and have it start heating up, but no -- you have to first press the desired temp button then press the Start button. On the other hand if you press the Start button first it will start heating up to the temp you last used, which is fine if you always use the same temp, but I don't -- and I thought the point of this was to easily be able to bounce around between different temps for different beverages.

So now I have to figure out how to re-label the buttons without making this cool kettle look janky. :)\n\nJust putting that out there for any office managers looking for a crowd-pleasing kettle. Add a label maker to your order, and you're all set.\n\nUPDATE: It's been a couple years, and now the lid cover keeps coming off, which means the spring mechanism is uncovered and stops working.

This kettle is fantastic, and now I want one for my office.\n\nIt's not all sunshine and rainbows, don't misjudge the kettles appearance, it's not insulated, the exterior gets very hot, just like any other kettle really. People have a tendency to assume it's insulated due to it's appearance, maybe my friends are stupid, but a few house guests have given little yelps when accidentally touching the body of the kettle. This is also due in part to the fact that when the kettle is full it can be quite heavy if you don't have enough of hand strength. Also the little beep it gives off when the water is at temp is almost inaudible if your playing music or even having a conversation, I guess it's preferable to it being too loud.\n\nThe cordless design is also great, construction is solid, if you care about how your coffee and tea taste, this is a must buy.\n\nUpdate on 6-26-11: lately the boil setting has been reluctant to beep, it's intermittent, but sometimes it will boil away for a good two or three minutes before finally beeping. the other temperature settings work just fine, but I have been keeping a closer eye on it since I noticed the issue."},{"reviewerName":"Ed Garvin","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great product.","reviewDate":"June 14, 2014","reviewText":"I drink tea daily, and have an assortment of teas be it white, green, black, or herbal from which to choose.

However, my latest RH Kettle died after about 18 months of use for no apparent reason. It just never turned on again. After reading other reviews it seems the general opinion is that they were once great but not any more. Which sent me on a search through kettles reading numerous reviews. (thank you, all reviewers!)\n\nSo far the kettle is great! Some things I love:\na) The lid opens with a push button so it is no longer a two hand job to fill the kettle.\nb) There are various settings for different kinds of tea! how great is that! These settings include temps for white and green tea, french press coffee and plain old boil. :)\nc) There's an optional \"keep warm\" button which will keep the water at your selected temperature for 30 minutes and then turn off. I especially love this as I would leave the room, do something while waiting for the water, it would take longer than expected and I'd always be reheating the water.... (maybe why Russell Hobbs broke??)\nd) It beeps when ready! Why don't they all? It's not a loud, annoying beep but if you're listening for it you will hear it.\ne) The window reservoir window clearly shows (and measures) how much water you've got in the pot'\nf) Yes, it heats quickly. I rarely fill the kettle to the top and the half kettle that I'm heating seems to take only a minute or two.\n\nWhat I don't love and why I didn't give this 5 stars:\na) There;s nothing exceptional about the appearance of the kettle. Nothing awful, but i could have enjoyed a style with a little pizzazz.\nb) Not sure if the cord is really going to wind up in the base as tight as I would like (haven't gotten to this yet).\n\nThe kettle arrived within 48 hours of being ordered. I rinsed it out, plugged it in and had tea within minutes. Such a relief to have a HOT cup of tea as I've been using a keurig which doesn't have a real hot setting.\n\nI'm pleased with my selection and would encourage others to buy this kettle. It's not a cheap kettle but the features are great and I'm hoping it will last like the old Russell Hobbs used to."},{"reviewerName":"Donald","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"A+ recommended for the tea drinker in your family","reviewDate":"June 9, 2017","reviewText":"Purchased for my GF (now fiance) and she loved it.

The water gage is nice, with the LED light very easy to read. The buttons are clearly marked with the temperature settings and types of tea the temperature is good for as well. While the water is being heated, for some reason this kettle sounds like a jet engine. It is LOUD. The stainless steel exterior also get extremely hot.

This kettle doesn't disappoint.\n\nMy schedule for the past few years has been to get up long before my wife, feed the kitties, putter around, and take my shower before waking her with a morning coffee. About six weeks ago, I started using a French Press for a superior product. But, the press played havoc with my schedule.\n\nBefore, the coffee maker started on a timer. Having coffee was therefore leisurely. However, the French Press requires me to boil fresh water, grind fresh beans, and wait a proscribed 4 minutes before pressing the coffee. In other words, I had 20 minutes eaten up just making coffee. It wrecked my schedule!\n\nBut this kettle is PERFECT for my schedule. When I feed the kitties, I just have to press the kettle's 200F/French Press button and Start, and the kettle will have the water ready for me when I get out of the shower. It holds the water at the perfect temperature, and I do not have to worry about the water boiling out. Making coffee is leisurely again.\n\nI don't particularly care how fast the kettle heats the water; the unique temperature holding function is what I value. That sets this kettle apart, and is why I had it on my wish list in the first place.\n\nWe've also used the kettle to boil water for cooking recipes.

The electric base was sitting in a puddle of water and the water fortunately dripped down the line and into my waste basket before hitting the electrical socket. (That would have blown all of my equipment in my studio. Phew!). I have given it a three based on the fact that I have used it for a year, and didn't have any problems, but I have not been able to contact Cuisinart to see if they will still repair/replace this product. Will update again once that happens.\n\n03/16: Best recent kitchen appliance I have purchased. After nearly burning up my kitchen with a conventional tea kettle (yeah, yeah, forgot it was on. Shout out to Max, my barking dog on the save) I purchased the CPK-17. I noticed a vast difference in the taste of the tea from the very first pot. As most have said, green tea tastes bitter, and hence they do not drink it. The green tea I've had for nearly a year now is gone, and I now know what green tea should taste like. I'm also experimenting with other brews now as well. Fast, safe, easy to use with multiple presets for the perfect cup of tea. Purchase and enjoy!"},{"reviewerName":"wfodys","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Very convenient","reviewDate":"January 2, 2019","reviewText":"We got this several weeks ago and have been using it multiple times a day.

There is a 3 year warranty but I am just beyond it. I now need a new kettle but as much as I truly enjoyed using this one, I won't purchase again. I don't think it's reasonable for a product at this price point, $80.00, to not last longer than a few years. Othert than this fatal flaw, I thought the kettle was wonderful and even recommended it many times to friends and family.

For the reviewer who complained about scale developing even with filtered water, you need to check into that filter - our house has ridiculously hard water but when we filter it, we never get any scale at all.

The kettle comes with a three-year warranty, so I wasn't too concerned. However, as other reviewers have noted, Cuisinart expects the customer to pay shipping both ways -- first, whatever it costs to mail the kettle back to Cuisinart for inspection; second, the $15 fee they charge to return a functional kettle to the customer. So it would cost maybe $25 to $30 to get a replacement for a product that I paid $79 for new? Not much of a warranty after all. So we toughed it out for a few more months, guesstimating the correct temperatures at which to pour water for coffee and tea by listening carefully. Today, a little more than a year after the original purchase, the kettle stopped working entirely. Just sits there, cold, for a few minutes, and then beeps at us. Lovely.

First, the window that shows how much water is in the kettle is under the handle which makes it very hard to see, especially when you're filling the kettle. Our old (actually ancient) kettle had the fill window on the side so it was very easy to see how much water was in it while filling it. Second, when your water boils (or reaches the desired temperature), the beeps that the kettle makes are so quiet that they're very difficult to hear. But these are relatively minor quibbles. The kettle looks good and boils water like it should."},{"reviewerName":"Kevin Barone","rating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Defective Filling Lid Button Jams and Cuisinart Charged Me For Return Shipping","reviewDate":"November 22, 2013","reviewText":"I got this kettle in February for my girlfriend.

They were very nice and offered to replace it, but they're charging me $15 for the shipping, plus requiring that I send the old one back to them, again at my expense.

I contacted the company and they said they would send me a new one so apparently mine isn't right but they said I'd have to pay to send mine back and pay to have the new one sent!

You get boiling, or nothing. This is the lowest entry point for that except for the Adagio Utilitea. Which has better reviews and can be had for $45 in the back corners of the internet searches + retailmenot\n\nI chose this for two simple reasons - 1.) I'm married and my wife likes brand names for the kitchen <sigh> 2.) It has 3 yr warranty, compared to 1 yr warranty on Adagio product.\n\nIf you see all the bad reviews on Adagio - it is because of 1 yr failure rate and lack of support. I didn't want to quite risk that. It felt like for +$30..hedging my risk for 3 years was smarter.\n\nEverything else it does fine. Something important to bring up - there is no reasonable electric kettle that lets you set temp..you get presets. (e.g. there is no 184 degrees, or 178 degrees if you want to dabble with brewing temperature of your coffee or dark/light roast)...but there is a french roast setting (200), as well as 160, 175, 185, 190 & 212 (boil)"},{"reviewerName":"Briana Duffy","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great buy!","reviewDate":"November 11, 2017","reviewText":"Bought this product 2 years ago.

I was asked for the model number and the serial number, both in small letters and numbers on the bottom of the kettle. I was able to read the model number. The serial number, which was stamped onto the plastic on the bottom, was indecipherable. Somehow the stamp had broken up the number. The customer service person at Cuisinart agreed that the kettle was still under warranty, but claimed that Cuisinart could not replace it without the serial number. We went around in circles. I kept trying to read the number. I got a magnifying glass and tried to read the number. This went on for forty minutes. In the end I gave up. But then I wrote Cuisinart customer service. I received a hyper-bureaucratic reply telling me that even though I had proof of purchase and the model number, I still needed the (indecipherable) serial number to obtain an exchange. I was ordered to send a photograph of the stamp (impossible with my photographic equipment) and to \"please reply, with all previous correspondences attached, to this email. Please reply, with history, to this email.” In the end, I'd wasted $76 on high end junk and a huge amount of precious time trying to work with a wholly dysfunctional customer service.

The variable water temps are great, and it's been nice to experiment the effect of water temp on coffee - it really does make a difference, and I've found depends on the coffee bean itself.\n\nIn terms of reliability, I don't see this thing breaking for a while - it's solidly built, with a good feel behind the buttons and controls.

The temp selection and stainless body were nice options. After a year there haven't been any issues even with daily use ( at least 7-12 times a week). The temp is consistent which is a plus since I burn my tongue when beverages are too hot. It could be set to my liking without having to wait for it to cool down. The body is easy to clean but gets hot so be careful when handling. The handle stays nice and cool though and feels sturdy and comfortable. The window that shows water level is also a nice touch that takes away the guess work when making small amounts of tea or coffee. All in all it's been a great product for me and I would recommend.

It does boil the water and keep it at temperature, which is why it gets a 2 star rating.\n\nInitially this product was great, and invade no problems. However, lately the product has been introducing debris into my otherwise clean water. This was not as noticabke in tea as it was in my coffee. No matter how much I rinsed the product, even with filtered water, the debris did not cease. I believed this was from some piece that was loosening. Hopefully, it was just some harmless glue and not like caulk or something because, as I said, it wasn't very noticeable in tea and initially I mistook this for some issue with my milk. Then some little black pieces began to show and I knew that this was going back.\n\nCleaning was not very easy. The instructions say to wipe down after very use. I, however, had to let it air dry because my hands and several of my co-workers hands were too big to fit inside the unit. The scale filter obviously doesn't work either seeing as though those particles would make their way into my tea and coffee as evidenced by simply looking at the water in a clear glass, such as a french peess.\n\nThere are also lots of piece that are inside of this product and most of them are plastic. Some plastic glass looking thing covering a screw I guess. Plastic housing for the scale filter, plastic line fo something inside the unit. Plastic top inside, plastic holding the top inside. It seems far too complicated. There are also clips or fastener s that hold the base together at th bottom.\n\nVery disappointed in the product.\n\nIt's also very loud. Even when not boiling water I can hear it clearly over the TV from 15 feet away."},{"reviewerName":"Jeremy","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"I suspect like most thing it is flashy but not designed to ...","reviewDate":"December 29, 2016","reviewText":"This kettle lasted about 5 years of mostly daily use.

They are shipping me a brand new kettle for the shipping cost of $15, and then I will return the old one at my cost. I think this is very fair.

Only issue is that I like to nearly always empty out the kettle in-between heating sessions, in order to not have standing water at room temperature for any prolonged period of time in the kettle, in order to prevent microbial growth. The interior design of the kettle makes completely emptying the kettle of water challenging because of the many crevices and fissures in the kettle.

I have found a way around that, though. I use a measuring cup to transfer water from the tap to the kettle. No biggie.

The last thing that I want is to drink rusty water. I contacted Cuisinart and they said that they would only replace the kettle if I paid $15 to ship it back to them.

We alternate between Green and White tea with an occasional Black. We use to take the temperature of the water and let it adjust so that we could brew each tea at the proper temperature. This kettle was a godsend. Worked well but now it boils water on all temperatures and is two months out of warranty. We may call American Express since they add a year to the guarantee but we really do not want to take advantage of them. Most reviewers place reviews early in their experience, and we too would have rated it at five stars as many have, but seeing so many failures in the reviews accompanied with 20/20 hindsight one must purchase this item with the realization that they maybe replacing the kettle frequently and this becomes expensive."},{"reviewerName":"J.

The setting for 190 degrees would only be 180 degrees when it poured into the mug, even with preheated mug, etc.\n\nThe labels for temperature settings wore off in a few months. There isn't any etching or imprints, just delicate paint that will wear off after you press it about 100 times.\n\nUnless you press a button to cancel the \"keep warm\" function, it will constantly reheat which is just a waste of money. My wife could never remember to cancel the reheat.\n\nSounds like others have really great experiences but ours would be considered average when it was working and now that it is broken, abysmal.\n\nThanks.\n\n7/24/13 - I did hear back from Cuisinart.

You would not believe that someone actually spend some thought on designing it's functionality.\nAnd i am still wondering if they have, or if it was a sample product manufactured on blueprints from a 7th grade student project.\nFirst of all: Who likes his kitchen being light up by blue light if your water boiler is plugged in? Hands up please! I count zero.\nUnless you dont have lights in your kitchen - (a problem in it self, i guess) this may be a useful device.\nSecondly: A memory function to continue boiling my water as i left it off? Please! I take it off, i want it to cool down. I want it to re-heat: I push the button to re-heat. I don't like (super dumb) artificial intelligence in my water boiler.\nThird: look at all these nice stains you get when touching it! A criminal scientists dream - but not mine.\nYou may be able to handle the device without fingertips - if you are good with your elbows, have supernatural powers or wear gloves all day.\nMe - none of the mentioned - hence i spent more time cleaning the damn thing than using it.\nFourth: after you have done your water this ingenious device keeps lighted. Is it a sign of pride of having done such a great job of boiling that water? Must be - because it completely beats me why anyone would want his kettle light up after use. (Ok - the folks without kitchen lights maybe).\n\nOh Fifth: The thing actually broke after day 4. It would continue boiling after the water was heated, and beep like mad because you actually used it for what you have bought it for - boiling water and using the water, once it is boiled. I understand that this is a use case the designers of this\ningenious masterpiece clearly did not have in mind (Kitchen lamps were haunting their minds!) - so maybe it wasn't broken but it worked as designed.Now this could again be a design feature - i simply call it broken. And am extremely happy to have returned this piece of\ncompletely useless junk.\n\nAfter all - it did actually boil water.

J. Slemenda Jr.","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great water heater: efficient, quick, and accurate.","reviewDate":"March 8, 2016","reviewText":"Great, so far. If it dies in the future I'll probably come back to tell everyone. I've had this unit for approximately three weeks now, and I use it to make 2.8 liters of tea, for iced tea, every morning. I let it steep in glass 1-liter carafes, and making it right after breakfast gives it time to slowly cool down naturally as well as suck all the benefit from one standard-sized tea bag per carafe. At lunch I have a liter plus a little and my wife has about .8 liter. For dinner I have another liter of tea, and mi esposa has water. That's in addition to the glass of wine we each have with dinner. I've been looking for something like this for a year, and I hadn't been impressed enough to even try anything I could find until now. There were either control issues or size issues that made the other kettles I'd considered unsuitable for my use. For years I've used my coffee maker to heat the tea water, and my coffee maker, one of the discontinued Braun models, is getting rather long in the tooth. I really like the coffee it makes, so I'm using the Cuisinart tea pot to absorb a great part of the workload. I heat the water for two of the carafes (1.8 liters total) together, and after I pour them from the pot into the first two carafes I immediately pour the third carafe containing the final liter of water into the Cuisinart pot. I don't have to do anything to restart it since it remembers what it was doing for about two minutes after it's removed from the base. Finally, after it finishes heating, and I've poured the hot water into the third carafe along with a tea bag, I set it back on the stand, it lights back up, and I hit the start button again to turn it off, and I'm done with it for the day. Very efficient operation. Since the tea we use is almost always black tea I normally use the highest or boil setting."},{"reviewerName":"Jason Montleon","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"This thing is excellent","reviewDate":"January 5, 2013","reviewText":"This thing boils water for tea, coffee, or even ramen very quickly.

Nope! Wrong! More cheap junk MADE IN CHINA that didn't make it through 2017. Garbage!

Depending on what kind of tea I want, I just pour water in it and set the temperature. A few minutes later, I have the water I need at the correct temperature. I had a Zojirushi water heater and found it difficult to use. I was always kept at one water temperature and if I wanted a cooler temperature, I had to wait a long time to have it cool down or try to mix it with cooler water. If I wanted a warmer temperature, I had to wait for the Zojirushi to boil and then cool down to that temperature--taking way to long to simply get the temperature of water that I wanted.

After you're done pouring, you can leave this on, or simply press it to turn it off. I also enjoy how the kettle can be placed in any direction on the base. It can be turned in any direction!

I chose to go with this one because of the price point and reviews! Functionally it's the same as my friends Breville, but I got it for almost half the price! I rated it at 4-stars because the keys on the handle look a little cheap in comparison to the rest of the kettle. That could be improved. Many reviewers commented that after time the numbers started to fade. I have not had mine long enough for that to be an issue. However, the buttons have that rubber feel so I can see that being in issue after longterm use. It's not loud at all and very comparable to my friends Breville, and I know because I borrowed hers for a week while I decided which to purchase.

The water sensor is shot and it always thinks the unit is empty so it won't heat anything. It is under warranty but they charge me $15 handling and I have to cut the power cable off and send it back to them. I tell them I'm going to try to fix it first before going through that...since I have to destroy the broken unit anyway, why not? They tell me that if I take apart this piece of hardware they want me to throw into the dumpster, I will void the warranty (I mean in practice, how would they ever know, but it's principle of the thing) and they won't replace it.

The idea behind this kettle is perfect, if only it did what it was supposed to. When I am able to get a cup of hot water I am a happy camper, but my issues with this kettle are as follows:\n* When I fill the kettle, with 1L of water, and immediately set it on to the base for heating, I get a constant beep. After filling the kettle I have to set it on the counter and wait 3 minutes before the base will receive the canister.\n* The water goes cold VERY quickly. There is a button allowing option to keep the water warm, but it keeps it tepid at best. If you're hoping to top up your tea or coffee you will be sorely disappointed with the temperature.\n* More often than not I am unable to heat the water without setting the kettle down for 3 minutes to reset. I never overfill, so I'm not sure what the problem is, but if you have guests, or are trying to make coffee in a rush this is extremely frustrating.\n\n* What I DO like about this kettle is that WHEN it works it heats the water quickly. With my old kettle I had to wait 4-5 minutes for the water to boil. This boils much faster, but I'd say overall I spend much more time trying to get this kettle to work properly. Between trying to reset the kettle and the actual boiling time it can take more closer to 6 minutes to make a cup of coffee, if I'm lucky.\n\nThe concept is great, but it's not without serious glitches. If you're hoping for a good cup of coffee I'd stick to a simpler design."},{"reviewerName":"Mo","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Four Stars","reviewDate":"October 30, 2016","reviewText":"Great kettle, perfect for a tea lover"},{"reviewerName":"Kristen Allan","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Broken After 8 Months","reviewDate":"March 9, 2015","reviewText":"I bought this in August and it broke in March.

I go through buckets of tea. This electric kettle has changed for the worse, and at this price, I'm disappointed. More complex mechanisms don't equal a better teapot, just more things that can go wrong. The designer was enamored of cool blue light, so made odd changes that look nice on paper, but don't work in real life. The water-fill line is very hard to read, however lit by the glowing blue light. It's been inexplicably moved from the side, to being placed under the handle. You have to fill the kettle from the top, holding the handle, which makes it hard to see what's going on. And the measurements are now in liters, not cups. Importantly, the kettle is almost impossible to turn off! Even if you turn it off prior to pouring, it will turn-on again the minute you place it back on the heating element, and overheat. If you don't turn it off again by clicking twice, lights will flash. Watch out! Then, the only way you can turn off the demented, overheated thing is fill it with water, turn it on, then turn it off with repeated clicks. Or unplug it. And fill it with water to cool it off. I strongly suggest that for safety, unplug it after every use! If you don't, and it inadvertently gets bumped, even a little bit, it can come back on by itself when empty. Silly, silly design changes. The pour spout doesn't even work as well. We'll see if this works for five years, like the last one did. I don't care about the temp for white tea, and preferred the previous model, a good, workmanlike kettle, unhindered by these \"innovations.\""},{"reviewerName":"Arden Bercovitz","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Five Stars","reviewDate":"January 25, 2016","reviewText":"Good price, fast service and free shipping, I am a happy camper."},{"reviewerName":"MTHB","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Five Stars","reviewDate":"October 3, 2015","reviewText":"good little product is performing as advertised.

Whatever shorted out inside this product threw the switch in the house main breaker box and shut the entire line down. I restored electricity to the outlet and tried the kettle again.

It is nice-looking and it heats the water appropriately, but it leaks like a sieve. At first I assumed the water around the base was from my sloppy handling of the full kettle (it's kind of heavy). Now the few drops of water has turned into a flood. It appears the water is leaking from the plastic window that shows the water from the inside. There are no screws we can tighten to fix the problem. I have had the kettle for one month and Amazon says I cannot return it now because their 30-day window for returns has slammed shut. Wow, what a bad policy. If this was a local store, they would certainly work with me, as the product is obviously defective and subject to warranty replacement.

The most most important thing to know is that it completely stopped working after 3 months. Even it it kept working I would still give it a very low rating. First, the steel walls of the kettle are boiling hot to the touch. Second, the lid only opens part way so refilling it is difficult and cleaning is extremely difficult. Third, the level indicator is hard to see because it is blocked by the handle. Fourth, it is a bit hard to get back on the base.

It's my go-to kettle for tea because I love having several options of temperatures, and I love the keep-warm feature which allows me to easily brew several small infusions of tea over 30 minutes (or more). Also it's very quick to come to temp, and I like the audible alert when the water's ready. BUT:\n\nThis kettle is dangerous. I can't believe this isn't mentioned in every single review. This kettle is a single-walled, stainless steel design. Stainless steel is a fantastic thermal conductor. If the water inside the single stainless steel wall is 212 degrees, what temperature do you think the outside of the stainless steel wall is? About 212 degrees. I'm serious. Do not touch the walls of this thing while water is boiling in it! Or even near boiling in it. How did this get approved for sale in the US? Do not let your kids anywhere near this while you're using it! I don't have kids and I know not to touch it when it's operating (guess how I know!), so this is okay with me since holding it by the handle is perfectly comfortable. But really, I'm stunned that it's allowed on the market.\n\nAlso, the last ounce or two of water does not pour out cleanly, and you simply cannot completely drain the kettle. This is due to the plastic clip that is bolted over the pour spout on the interior. The clip holds the filter, which is meant to keep flakes from hard water build up from ending up in your cup. But whether or not you use the filter (I don't), that clip interferes with the stream of water in such a way that the last ounce or two of water pours out not in one coherent stream but in 3-5 separate trickles, one of which drips down from above the spout! And the last tablespoon or two of water simply will not come out no matter how you hold / jiggle / shake the pot. Very annoying.\n\nDespite those two design flaws, one of which is IMO very serious, I still use it because it's the only option I've found that lets me quickly bring a small volume of water (less than 1/2 liter) to any of several different temps and hold it there for 30 minutes (or more if you hit Start again). But if there was a comparably priced alternative without these two major flaws, I'd buy that one instead."},{"reviewerName":"Barbara","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great kettle!","reviewDate":"November 27, 2012","reviewText":"Bought this kettle about six months ago and held off before I reviewed it.

The numbers have pretty much rubbed off the prefixed temperature buttons but after years of routine I just push the same buttons and haven't noticed. I can always refer to the images here if I need a reminder for lapse in memory. Also, I never use it to boil water for coffee and teas as that negatively impacts the taste of my coffees and teas.\n\nThe kettle is as beautiful and stylish as the day I got it. There's a tiny bit of lime scale at the bottom of the kettle as a result of not routinely rinsing it with a lime scale remover. Think I ran vinegar through it only once. I highly recommend this kettle. Rating upgraded from four to five stars as a result of it's longevity and quality.\n\nOriginal review:\n-----------------------\nI'll have to follow up with a follow up review. A couple of points:\n\n* Not as heavy as I had imagined based on the reviews (male in my late 30s)\n* Initially a little concerned about the buttons on the kettle itself which might get wet from washing. Curious if any of the failures people are reporting have anything to do with this part getting wet. I'll pay cautious attention to this.\n* Heats up really fast and beats having to watching my old tea pot in getting the right temperature for green tea. Think I've almost burn myself a few times popping open the lids to gauge temperature.\n* Operates at 1500 watts. I would have settled for 1000 but wouldn't get the quick heat up.\n* Plastic / poly-blah-blah-blah parts. None of the pictures show exactly where the plastic parts are. The product video barely flashes the internal of the kettle to disclose how much of it is plastic. None of the other kettles seem to show the internals as well. This is a sticking point and I hope by next year they will have come up with a better engineering design to eliminate the need for any plastic parts. As it stands today all of the variable temperature kettle at least use some plastics for sealing the lid for a better seal.\n\nAll in all I'm satisfied with the purchase. I went through several options to the Pino, Chef's Choice, Breville, and Adagio. The Pino doesn't seem to be well built with the cheap looking digital readout along with complaints of rusting (that's unacceptable). Chef's Choice didn't offer anything over the Cuisinart with it's bigger price tag (still has the plastic water gauge but looks to come in direct contact with the water). I'm not sure if the Breville is bpa free or not. Either way, I don't care for the design where the water gauge is part of the water container. With the Cusinart the water is separated from the water gauge somewhat and the exposure is reduced. The way the water gauge works is that there's a tube in the bottom that moves the gauge up through water pressure. Adagio is coming out with a new kettle but that's not for a few months and their previous kettle had issues. Lots of consumers seem to have had issues with their previous model (as they noted on their web site even). The new kettle from Adagio looks pretty attractive from the web pictures however.\n\nWith all that in mind, the round up choice is this Cuisinart. Let's see how it holds up. For those curious I'll be posting photos of the internals of the kettle so you know exactly where the plastic parts are. I removed the plastic screen filter so that won't be shown."},{"reviewerName":"Herbert Merrick","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great way for tea and hot water","reviewDate":"February 11, 2015","reviewText":"Took a time to figure out exactly how to get it to work.

All the positive reviews from others are true, but I have one complaint I hadn't seen elsewhere. The spout is a separately \"welded\" piece (for lack of proper terminology I'm calling it welded). When almost empty during a pour (meaning, the more I have to tilt it to get to those last few ounces) it doesn't pour well at all. That separate spout piece, combined with the useless (to me) water filter retainer, cause the water to not pour smoothly. I find it mildly annoying. If they just dropped the filter feature completely and changed the inside shape of the spout we'd have a 5 star winner."},{"reviewerName":"dale","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Five Stars","reviewDate":"February 9, 2017","reviewText":"Bought this for my daughter for Christmas and she absolutely loves it!"},{"reviewerName":"Tweetys Love","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Feels great, when you have company and they fall in ...","reviewDate":"September 3, 2016","reviewText":"Feels great, when you have company and they fall in love with this product, just as much as I did after using it.

Lai","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great kettle functionality - but has serious design flaws (some dangerous!!)","reviewDate":"January 11, 2012","reviewText":"We've had this kettle 2 days now and it definitely is superb with regard to heating water to the best temp for the kind of tea you drink. In fact, I can honestly say now that green and white teas are definitely wonderful when brewed at the proper temp - I never would have guessed. However, I have yet to figure out what they mean by \"delicate teas\"??\n\nMeanwhile, here are the design flaws that bug me and my husband:\n* The outsides of the kettle get super hot and you can really burn yourself seriously if you accidentally touch the sides once the kettle has boiled. The handle, of course, is fine, but it is easy to brush against the sides of the kettle with your hand.\n* Another problem with the kettle is the lid for the top opening: if you have boiled water, the lid gets hot like the outer sides of the kettle. This poses a problem if you have run out of water and need to refill -- you pop open the lid with the \"open\" button, fill the kettle, then you have to use your hand to push the lid closed. BUT... the lid may still be hot from the recent boil and you can actually burn your fingertips slightly!!\n* I find the kettle is weighted poorly when filled with more than 1.25L of water and it can be very difficult to pour - a dangerous problem when pouring hot water.\n* I personally find the opening at the top of the kettle is a bit too small. I filter my water and fill the kettle from the filter pitcher instead of the faucet. I find the kettle opening is too small to easily pour into from the pitcher, causing water to spill outside the kettle and onto the base (which is not a good idea). I am learning to stop and take careful aim with the pitcher when I fill the kettle - a really annoying inconvenience.\n* The beeps that sound when the water is ready are very low in volume and barely audible, even if you are standing right next to the counter.\n\nSo, beware of these problems, esp. the first three items that I noted. As I indicated in the title, the kettle functionality is excellent and I am now getting to enjoy certain teas more than ever. As we have only 2 adults in our household, we can deal with the dangerous problems, but you need to decide if you want to introduce that into your home."},{"reviewerName":"a_isforamy","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Amazon was AWESOME and sent out a replacement","reviewDate":"October 28, 2015","reviewText":"I will NEVER order this product again.

It has actually useful and worthwhile features (temp, and \"keep warm\"). My coffee really does seem better at 175F (aeropress).\n\nIn use though, you have to 'learn it'. Not hard, but bearing in mind we're not doing anything even a tad complex, seems a bit unnecessary. At the start there was a lot of trying buttons and not being entirely sure whether it succeeded or not.\n\nFor example, my first use: hit the temp I want. It should have started, but it looks like it hasn't - heh, \"Start\" is unlit, press that; hey - now the temp is flashing, wtf? looks urgent, I have to press something... Hit the temp again... nothing changes. Oh, perhaps it just flashes like that in that urgent looking manner for no reason... Well, not too painful. Wait, I've finished with it, how do I make it stop...? What?, I really have to manually turn the thing off every time?\n\nThis is all in the manual and not too obscure, but really, how much should I need a manual? How confused should a guest in my house be by /an electric kettle/?\n\nAt this price I expect someone to do a quality design of the controls, not just the aesthetics. I do like the kettle and I'm feeling generous so I'm giving it a 4, rather than a 3, but it's a close thing.\n\nReview Edit: definitely dropping this to 3 stars, might contemplate 2. My wife and I, who are pretty tech-savvy, get caught out by the silly interface for this frequently - both intending to turn it on and failing, and failing to turn it off when we're finished with it. Added to that, and it's increasingly failing to shut off from the boil setting in a timely manner. I think it still shuts off, but takes a couple of minutes of boiling. Overall, it's a nice looking product, but the user experience was not designed properly at all, and the performance is questionable."},{"reviewerName":"Ronald S.

Variable temp is nice. I don't care that the outside gets a little hot. We've had it for a while so it seems to last (so far).\n\nNow the cons:\n-The beep. For a tea lover, for whom tea represents a gentle morning wakeup, chai on Indian trains, hearty mugs in old English kitchens, and tea salons in Paris, the clinical-sounding beep when the water is done was a turnoff from the first boil.\n\n-The logic. This pot thinks it knows me. It's like the Apple of electric kettles. If you take the pot off before the completion beep and put it back on the base, it continues to heat (guess what? I already poured my water, which is why I took it off). It defaults to the Keep Warm setting, so it continues to waste energy and add mild noise pollution to my kitchen unless I remember to turn off that setting.\n\n-The choices. They obviously just threw in an Oolong setting to have an even six buttons for symmetry. In the morning, when my kids haven't slept and I need my cup of strong black tea, my eyes can hardly sort through all the text and numbers.\n\nI was going to give this three stars, but as I write this I realize just how much this kettle annoys me.

I've had it for more than 2 years and it is still in perfect condition. It's great for those who drink white, green tea as they don't need the temperature to be as high as black tea for example. The fact that it is stainless steel also gives me a peace of mind as I wanted something with least plastic possible in the inside. The inside of this kettle is all stainless steel and you won't see any heating element like the old/cheap ones. Also I love the fact that it is can be detached from the base so easily and smoothly which make it super easy to work with. Even for those who are not tea drinkers this is good for making hot chocolate, french press coffee, instant coffee, cereal, oat meal, etc. I also love that when it is ready it makes a beep so that you won't need to stay next to it in the morning waiting for it to be ready. The kettle has this awesome function that it keeps the water warm for about 30min even after it beeps (reach the set temperature) so if you have guest over or can't get to it right away you hot water will stay hot. The outer side is also super easy to clean. The handle feels very solid and sturdy and the top lead opens and closes very securely.

It makes a bit of noise as it boils, but compared to some kettles my friends have, it's downright quiet! I like the beep at the end of the heating cycle which lets you know it is done. It also keeps warm incredibly well, which is great if you are making multiple warm beverages.\nFrom what I can tell, the temperatures are fairly consistent between runs. I don't have anything to measure this, but as far as the taste of the coffee I use it for, it's pretty consistent where too much variance in temperature can affect the flavor.\nIt also is quicker than a microwave/measuring cup combo. It takes longer to boil a cup of water in the microwave than it takes to boil 1/2 L (~2 1/8 cups) in the kettle.\nI know this is a feature on a lot of kettles, but the power base that you can take the kettle off of to pour is a nice feature. I had friends over for a Christmas party and we were all making hot chocolate with our own mixes we got at the store and I heated a liter of water and poured it in everyone's cups and didn't have to worry about a cord or anything like that.

This is truly a great tea kettle for anyone, but if you're a true tea enthusiest, this really raises the bar.\n\nPros:\nStainless steel keeps clean with little to no maintenance.\nTemperature controls let you get just the right temperature for the type of tea or coffee you're making, and of course, there's a boil feature for anything you'd need boiling water for. I've even used this to keep water hot for when I'm taking a bath and I want to spike it with hot water :-)\nThis is quick. Super quick. Only fill it for how much you need. It's rare that I fill this all the way full as it's not every day I'm entertaining a group of tea drinkers.\nThe keep warm feature will turn the kettle back on and keep your water at your perfect temp for up to half an hour.\nI like that you can fill this by either flipping open the lid, or just filling it through the spout which is typically what I end up doing from my PUR faucet filter.\nIt's fairly quiet. No annoying whistle when you're water is boiling, just a quick beep.\nYou have the option of unselecting the \"keep warm\" button so if you're going for single serve, it'll just cut off when you return it to the base.\nCordless kettle, so you can have it on its base close to a plug and carry the kettle itself wherever.\nFairly large capacity lets you boil up to 1.7 L which can be useful if you're using this for things other than making a drink.\nI've had mine for 3 years with daily use and none of the writing has worn off as some other reviews have said.\nWater gauge on the outside of the kettle lets you see how much water you have.\n\nCons:\nThe default is for the \"keep warm\" option, which I rarely use. Took me a bit to figure out what combination of buttons would let me just warm up water and then have it cut off.\nThe blue light on the water gauge is quite bright and lights up when you return it to the stand. Stays lit for a while. It's just bright.\nWater gauge sometimes has to be shaken around a bit to get an accurate reading.\nCord on base is short, so you need to be near a plug."},{"reviewerName":"yurx","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Great teapot but started leaking in a bit over a year","reviewDate":"February 23, 2019","reviewText":"I liked it overall.

It heats a large amount of water quickly and efficiently at the selected temperature. I found that I can fill the kettle beyond the 1.7L capacity and not have the water bubble over through the spout. That's nice if you want to fill up extra and reduce the amount of fill-ups you need during the day. The see-through window for the water is very convenient and reliable. I find that the blue glow makes for a good night light if you happen to wake up early and need a soft glow to illuminate your kitchen or other surroundings. Odd, but nice. The stainless steel finish is clean and neat. There aren't any unsightly weld marks. The steel does tend to attract stains from fingerprints. I am careful to wipe down the surface before heating the water. Otherwise, the oils will be permanently stained into the steel.\n\nOne big black mark against the kettle is its ergonomics. The handle is very uncomfortable to use for lifting the kettle and pouring. There is too much curvature for my hand to grip it securely. I would have preferred a flat grip surrounded by curves. My guess is that the product designers looked at the kettle when it was empty or only lightly loaded with water and they don't use the kettle multiple times during the day.\n\nI have no doubt the kettle will work for a long time. However, when it breaks then it will have to be thrown away. It's electronically, vs. mechanically, controlled. I don't think I would buy this model if it were my own money vs. corporate money. My #1 CTQ would be a better handle. I would be willing to give up capacity and temperature control if required."},{"reviewerName":"c","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Fast water heating, and yes the numbers and letters rub off","reviewDate":"May 30, 2016","reviewText":"Although I buy lots of stuff on Amazon, and reading reviews for this and the Kitchenaid, I had to go into a real store since I wanted to compare them side by side, and with the 20% off coupon, was a little cheaper at the store. I like french press coffee and this one heats up to the recommended 200 degrees, whereas the Kitchenaid settings are either 190 or 195 or 212 degrees. Minor difference but what the hell. As for the markings coming off, decided to put some clear nail polish over each, and amazingly, if I pressed down too hard while doing it, the number started to disappear, so if you want to try it, a light touch is useful.

Half kettle full of water takes half the time to boil. I bought mine from local BBB. I was initially interested in purchasing the Breville BKE820XL Variable-Temperature 1.8-Liter Kettle but luckily it was out of stock and so I settled for the Cuisinart and I am glad that I did.\n\nThe key differences between this kettle and the Breville model are: the Breville has the controls on the all-stainless steel base while the Cuisnart has them on the handle. The Cuisinart base has some plastic that make it look a bit fragile and cheap. Breville has 1.8L capacity while Cuisinart has 1.7L. Breville has some polycarbonate on the water window while the Cuisinart has none. Breville costs $30 more than the Cuisinart. Breville sets oolong preset at 195 degrees F while Cuisinart has it fixed at 190. Finally and the main reason I settled for the Cuisinart- Breville has one year limited factory warranty while Cuisinart has three full years!\n\nI debated whether to duck one star for a couple minor issues but decided to let it slide. First the cheap plastic containing base (should have been all stainless steel like the Breville). Second the beep is barely audible. It is supposed to beep three times to alert you when the set temp is reached. While it chimes three times, the room has to be dead silent for you to hear it. It should have been louder.\n\nNB: The body gets and stays hot: If you grab or bump into it anywhere other than the handle you will get burnt.\nNB: If you drink mainly Herbal Teas like I do you should be aware that the setting for Herbal Tea is same as the French Press (200 degrees F). Also remember that if you do not want the kettle to hold the temp for 30 minutes you should either push the keep warm button before or during the heating cycle or simply push the start button after the desired temp is reached to turn off the unit.\n\nOverall this is a great looking Kettle that does what it is built to do pretty well. Highly recommended."},{"reviewerName":"K B","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Attractive and functional unit, recommend for those who enjoy loose tea or aspire to","reviewDate":"January 1, 2015","reviewText":"I've owned this kettle for 2 years now and am satisfied with it. I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a hot water kettle steps and steps above the cheapie $20 plastic ones, which I liked anyway and owned before. I have considered buying this kettle as a gift for others and certainly miss it when away from home for its convenience and utility. One tip - Bed Bath & Beyond sells this unit at retail price of $100 - with a 20% off coupon - it is $80. Keep this in mind if the price here is above that and you have a BB&B nearby.\n\nThe best feature of this kettle, and the reason I bought it, is the different temperature settings. I enjoy loose leaf tea, and without a machine to heat water to specific temp for optimal brewing, I wouldn't bother with loose teas. I haven't measured the accuracy of each temperature, though I'm sure if you scroll through the reviews you will find someone has, and my tea comes out well, and I have not noticed any blatant discrepancies. I also enjoy using this kettle to boil water for cooking to expedite waiting for water to boil on the stove.\n\nI like that this unit has a keep warm feature which if you enjoy several cups of tea and prefer not to wait to heat the water again, using this setting it will keep the water at your selected temp. You can just as easily turn this feature off after reaching your desired temp. When water has reached the desired temp, it will beep. The beep is a reasonable volume.\n\nThe stainless outside is very sleek looking, but it does catch stains easy, like stainless steel does, and needs occasional wiping to keep it looking clean. The unit overall is very sturdy and beefy, and I never feel it wobble when opening the lid to add water, or when pouring the water out. The lid opens with a button release, it is not a concern the lid will pop open while pouring hot water.\n\nI have noticed that there is some mineral build-up inside from using tap water. I've boiled vinegar to see if it would loosen it without avail. If anyone else has figured out a trick, I'd like to hear it. Anyway, the build-up is a minor flaw, attributed to my tap water.\n\nThe length of the cord is sufficient for my kitchen. This kettle stays out and is very near the outlet. and even so there is cord left. If outlets and counter space is a concern for you, don't forget to double check the technical specs of the cord length."},{"reviewerName":"Harth Huffman","rating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Works well while it lasts.

Cuisinart customer service was responsive and sent us a new one. Great. However, then also requested we send back our old one (not cheap to mail) and pay them for shipping the new one. That is questionable service, as has already been mentioned in other reviews. Now, less than six months later, our new one made some funny noises and stopped working. This is extremely wasteful.

The kettle also looks very nice and is well constructed. Here's my one beef with this product (and the reason it gets 3 instead of 5 stars)-the temp numbers on the buttons begin to wear off with regular use. In less than one year of regular use two of them completely disappeared. After over a year and half of heavy use ALL TEMP NUMBERS ARE NOW WORN AWAY!!! Even the temps I rarely or never use are gone because of my thumb over-lapping the button I was pressing onto the other ones!! ARRRGH! This so very aggravating. I know what the settings are because they are the ones I use most often, however for a kettle with a list price of $185.00 (I paid $80.00) THIS SHOULD NOT BE HAPPENING! Other than that it works perfectly.\n\n--UPDATE 12-8-2015-- The lid has now jammed forcing me to pry it open each time with a butter knife.

But it has serious flaws. First, the keep-warm mode is the default and that's not how I typically use it: heat water, dispense, done. Instead, the default behavior is to keep heating the water, wasting electricity, until the kettle runs dry, then to make an alarm which could compete with a fire or security system and flash the lights as if it were an emergency requiring everyone's attention. The keep warm mode can be turned off, but it's easy to forget to do this. Another issue is it's slow. My previous heater, a Braun, was faster (it began leaking, however). Finally, it can be difficult to determine if it's on or not, as the main \"heating\" light gets stray illumination from surrounding lights.\n\nSo this heating is adequate, but it tries to do to much.

If you're enough of a coffee nerd to make coffee with an aeropress or a French Press, you're almost certainly enough of a coffee nerd to be concerned about the precise temperature of the water you're using.\n\nYou can of course boil water either on the stove or in a microwave, but then you have to wait for the water to cool to your target temperature, which can be slow and annoying. Neither the stove or the microwave is going to maintain your water at your desired temperature either, so if you're making several cups with an Aeropress, there's the additional inconvenience of re-heating the water to the right temperature with each batch.\n\nEnter the CPK-17. It heats the water to a precise temperature, selectable from 160, 175, 185, 190, 200, or boiling, and it beeps and stops when it gets there. It keeps the water at that temperature for as long as you might like. It's fairly fast - it took just under 3 minutes to heat 1 liter of water 80 degrees F, from tap-water hot (105) to 185. I've found this so much more convenient than boiling water and then watching a thermometer.\n\nAnother reviewer complained that it 7.5 minutes to boil 1.5 liters of cold water.

The sheer number of reviews is testimony what a great kettle this is so I'll pass quickly through why this is a great kettle then focusing how it could be the greatest. Firstly this works as advertised, it's safe all around to accidental touch. The excellent temperature control ensures the water gets to the right temperature, the boiling water makes a fair amount of noise but it switches off just before spouting out steam. The spout is the best is the best I've seen without a dribble, my unit's wet area components are all all stainless steel with no rust traces. Boiling anti-scale agents leave an as new interior and the spout scale filter is effective & easy to clean.\nNow the the missing 5th star reasons:\n-The handle is unnecessarily chunky, I am big guy but that handle is a handful making it less user friendly for ladies and kids, if the circumference was juts half inch less it would have been a perfect handle.\n-The short power cord is extremely stiff relative to the light base, the random shape cord is unsightly and impossible to \"train\" into a new shape. Flexible similar rated cords do exist and it would make it easier to tuck the excess into the base while shaping the visible bit into something less conspicuous.\n-The control buttons outlines are lit but not the text/functions. During the day it's no problem but in a darker space it's impossible to identify the buttons unless their locations are learned. Other kettles light right through the button's text indicating clearly the selected function, however those kettles were poor performers in supplying hassle free hot water (over boiling, steam, spout dribble, hard to clean)."},{"reviewerName":"Tati_2012","rating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Bad customer service - Stopped working","reviewDate":"February 28, 2019","reviewText":"This kettle stopped working.

As a tea enthusiast, it's essential that I control the steeping temperature. This kettle has never let me down. It heats water faster than the microwave, and relieves me from having to figure out the best cooking time for desired temperature and amount of water. It is built to last; I have had zero issues with it.\n\nThis unit would be more perfect if the minimum fill level were one cup. If I'm only making one cup, the excess amount of water that has to be heated can waste a lot of energy over time. However, the minimum fill level is exactly enough to fill my Contigo mug, so only heating one cup's worth is a rare occurrence for me.\n\nDo not hesitate to buy this if you are a tea drinker! If not, it's a tough decision. If you're a coffee enthusiast, you may appreciate some of the settings. It also comes in handy for hot cocoa, allowing you to mix at a lower temperature than boiling, so your cocoa is ready to drink faster and is arguably safer to hand to the kids. It's a judgement call on your part."},{"reviewerName":"Artemisa","rating":"3.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"After two years, labels started to fade...","reviewDate":"July 31, 2013","reviewText":"I was expecting this product to be \"pristine\" after at least 4 years of mild use (I've used this kettle just once a day as much).

It is very convenient and easy to use, with recommended temps for various teas and one for French press coffee, plus boil. I use it strictly for coffee, my wife for tea. It is very quick. French Press is 200 degrees, but I prefer the setting of 185 degrees, which I find perfect for easy sipping without having the first few sips too hot. I use a thermal,mug which keeps my coffee the perfect temp from beginning to end. After using it for about 8 months the hinged lid fell completely apart which kept the lid from staying closed on it's own. We needed to place a weight on it to get the water to heat. I called Cuisinart and they informed me that they would replace it if I would pay them $15 for postage. They also wanted me to return the broken unit in the same box that the new pot was sent in. I received it today and discovered that they expect me to pay the postage on returning the broken unit. I also discovered that the new unit assumes the warranty of the original pot, while I assumed the new pot would have it's own warranty. If you have no problems this is a great way to get the perfect temperature for a hot beverage. I so prefer the ability to brew my beverage to an accurate temperature. If you have an issue though, consider the added expense of replacing it for the limited time of your remaining warranty."},{"reviewerName":"Suesie","rating":"2.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Very Unfortunete!","reviewDate":"February 5, 2015","reviewText":"I have used only the highest temperature almost 2 years.

Although I purchased it because I am a senior and it made sense to not worry about forgetting a kettle on the stove,the last couple of times I used the kettle I noted a mild smell of electrical wires burning. I couldn't identify the source and thought it must be my imagination. I'd used the kettle successfully for two months. Two days ago I boiled water for coffee. I DISCONNECTED the kettle from the base and UNPLUGGED the base because I was uneasy about the smell. I went out to clear ice off my car. I returned fifteen minutes later and the fire alarms in my house were all sounding. The house was filled with toxic smelling smoke. i went into the kitchen to see the plastic handle of the kettle shooting flames with flames coming from the plastic along the base of the kettle! I doused the flames but had I come in 60 seconds later the fire would have spread. Clearly the interior wires in the handle must have been smoldering when I went outside and later ignited the highly flammable plastic. I have looked up Cuisinart products since, and discovered that is a serious problem with some of their other electric kitchen appliances. The house was so smoke-infested that even when I opened all doors and windows, the alarms continued for 15 minutes! I had the strange ash the burning plastic produced all over surfaces - my books - my windowsills. And what I worse, I am coughing and coughing still from whatever I inhaled.\n\nTHIS PRODUCT NEEDS TO BE TAKEN OFF THE MARKET! It is unsafe!

I chose this kettle because it was a bit more reasonably priced than the competitor. There were only a couple issues raised in other reviews that I wanted to address.\n\n1) Some reviews state that this kettle will boil the water for a minute or two before beeping and turning off. My kettle boils for only a few seconds, maybe 10 seconds at most, before it beeps and turns off. I live at sea level. I think perhaps the elevation at which you're using this does make a difference since the kettle senses the temp, but at higher elevations water will boil at slightly lower temps ( ~208* above 2000 ft elevation) and therefore will boil for a minute or two before reaching 212* which triggers the sensor to turn off. I would think this would be an issue with all kettles for anyone living at higher altitudes and is not unique to this kettle.\n\n2) Many reviews state that the water pour is funny for the last cup or so. This is partly true. It does trickle the last tiny bit of water out, but only a fraction of a cup, nowhere near an entire cup. I have not removed the scale filter to try it without because this is not bothersome for me.\n\nI have been very happy with this kettle so far and definitely recommend it. My jasmine pearl green tea has been even more delicious at the proper temperature without any fuss. It is easy to use and does everything advertised.

The issue raised by other reviewers that the markings wear off the buttons is correct. That said, the kettle deserves at least four stars, so what's my problem?\n\nCuisinart's customer service, that's what. After a year and a half-- the kettle carries a three year warranty-- the lid would no longer open and was unrepairable. Contacting Cuisinart's customer service, I received a prompt reply requesting more information from representative A. Shortly received a duplicate request from representatives B and C. Responded the next day with requested information. A few days later, received a short form letter from representative C stating that since I'd not attached previous emails, they were unable to continue processing the claim as they \"...delete emails at the end of every day to save space on our server.\"\n\n'Scuse me? Emails, even hundreds of them take very little space and IMHO it would make much more sense to file emails (many email clients already allow viewing emails by thread) in such manner as to render them easily searchable and retrievable to facilitate easy continuation of a warranty claim.\n\nOK, my eclectic, logic-addled viewpoint aside, I cooperated and provided an email with all requested information, previous correspondences. Sent that and heard nothing back from Cuisinart-- neither representative A, B, or C-- for 48 hours.\n\nAttempting to call, one is greeted with an extended explanation of where one might find the serial and model numbers on a variety of Cuisinart products, after which the caller is presented with four choices, none of which applied in my case, so chose number five, causing a repetition of the instructions on finding the serial and model numbers followed by the helpful information that customer service representatives were busy and that wait times \"...currently exceed five minutes.\"\n\nQuite frankly, it seems like the runaround-- like Cuisinart is not genuinely dedicated to after-sales service of their products, despite their apparently generous warranties. The politician is brought to mind, who, once elected, promptly forgets fervid campaign promises to constituents. Here we have the first tea kettle elected to public office, apparently.\n\nQuite a contrast to a recent exchange with Bonavita about one of their teapots wherein after providing them with serial number, model, and so on, by filling out an online form, they quickly provided a replacement. (Oddly, our office pot developed a similar issue to that of our home kitchen Cuisinart kettle-- namely that the lid stopped opening properly.)\n\nIt seems that Cuisinart is not as dedicated to customer satisfaction as their guarantee would imply as their response to inquiries falls far short of the mark when it comes to expediently addressing after-purchase concerns. There is a lot of room for improvement here, Cuisinart.\n\nI'll amend this post once (if) I receive a response to my most recent request for a repair or replacement of the broken kettle. As it stands, two stars for the quality of the kettle, which is generally good, and minus three stars for the poor followup by Cuisinart's customer service department.\n\nStay tuned, fellow tea drinkers, for further developments in this case..."},{"reviewerName":"Charles W.

My wife did not keep the receipt. So, the warranty period started from the manufacturing date over 9 months prior to the purchase date, putting the kettle outside the one year warranty period. Even in the warranty period, you have to mail back the kettle at your own expense to get a new one. In any event, I would not have really wanted a new replacement, since too many reviews give the same litany: it's great while it lasts, but it does not last very long. The customer service person was very nice and professional, but she could not help me with my essential problem of having paid $99.00 for a product that lasted three months. It would be a great product if it did not have a durability problem, according to my experience and many online reviews. I would have researched before buying but did not have that option as it was a gift. My impression with Cuisinart on the phone is that if they can pull a technicality on you to save money, they will.

The lid doesn't stay closed, and pops up when we pour the water, or sometimes when it's still heating. The Keep Warm button is poorly placed, and can be pressed accidentally when we pick it up. Then, it won't shut off, and we have to put the kettle on the counter, not the heating pad, until it cools. Basically, it's too complicated. We just want to heat water to boiling for tea and coffee."},{"reviewerName":"Roberta Piercy","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Our second!","reviewDate":"November 29, 2018","reviewText":"Love this kettle.

A few years ago my friend and I both bought this tea kettle. Out of the box mine did not work so I had to return it. I received a new one and it worked great! Loved it. Now its been about 5 years and it is going crazy. It will water warm but does not boil or it beeps like it does when its ready, does nothing and then shuts off. Like the other reviewer said when it works it is the best kettle on the market. Now i'm debating on do I take a chance with Cuisinart again (it did last a few years) or just order the Breville?

There was power going to the kettle but it just didn't do anything and after a few minutes of waiting it would beep constantly!

So sad now","reviewDate":"January 11, 2012","reviewText":"I got this tea kettle as a gift last November. It was awesome. Heated water fast; different temperature settings for different types of teas. Kept the water warm in between cups. I didn't love that there was still some plastic that comes into contact with boiling water, but it had less than most. Then, 1 year and 2 months after I got it...it just stopped working. I don't know if the thermostat went out or what, but it no longer heats water. For this price....seems like it should last alot longer than one year + 2 months...just long enough to be beyond warranty. So...I'm off to search for a new electric kettle...hopefully one with NO plastic touching the water this time.\n\nUpdate...I replaced my broken Cuisinart kettle with a Hamilton Beach that has no plastic inside (but does have plastic on the lid). Have to say that I really miss the Cuisinart's feature of keeping the water warm for 1/2 hour. When the Hamilton dies, I'm going back to the Cuisinart...wish it had lasted longer but I love that \"keep it hot\" feature!"},{"reviewerName":"Lois C.

Flips out at you after boiling if you've left 'keep warm' on. Bad choice for just boiling water.","reviewDate":"April 20, 2016","reviewText":"Three things I dislike about this kettle:\n1. It doesn't pour water in a nice stream and doesn't pour out all its contents. I can never get out all the water I put in, and at the end of pouring, two little extra streams are coming from the edges of the spout. Seems like pouring water is kinda a key feature of a kettle.\n2. My typical interaction with the kettle goes like this: Put water in. Press Boil. Press Start. Wait for water to boil. Pour water out. Put kettle back. Keep making breakfast. Two minutes later, be startled when kettle starts flipping out, BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP, because it doesn't have any water in it any more. Apparently reading the product description this is because 'keep warm' is on so it's trying to keep itself warm while empty. There was no way to find that out except by reading the product description. Terrible design.\n3. It annoys me that I have to press two little buttons to get water boiling. I know that's a tiny complaint, but the fewer annoyances that I have to deal with before I'm caffeinated in the morning, the better. Give me a kettle with a simple switch at the bottom."},{"reviewerName":"J.

I put it on my Christmas list last month and was happy to have received it as requested. The tea making process has vastly improved. The boil time has been cut by 66% and it is really super quiet which I was curious about considering the extra power they threw into this thing. The varying temperature settings make it great for different types of tea. The keep warm function is great for me as I can't always get to the kettle in time. Having to press the \"Start\" button to stop the keep warm feature after I have lifted the kettle from the base seems a little odd in my opinion, considering the fact it seems to be quite intelligent in knowing that you've done so by turning it's lights off etc. Other than that, this is definitely a five star kettle in my opinion. Also has a very clean boiled water taste, not at all metallic which you can get sometimes with other heating element kettles."},{"reviewerName":"Gerry","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Worst kettle I ever purchased","reviewDate":"July 7, 2016","reviewText":"Worst kettle I ever purchased.\nI purchased 2 of these blunders, the first one died after 6 months, the lettering on the handle disappeared within 3 months.\nThe 2nd one, the lettering on the handle disappeared within 5 months and then it started leaking at the base of the handle.\nCuisinart never stands behind their product when it is faulty.

The first is a lid that opens all the way vertical, so you can fill it easily. The second feature, is so simple, I am not sure why it is not on every other kettle, it bleeps when it is boiled, and is quiet while it's boiling. The third feature, is it keeps the water warm for up to 30 min. after it boiled.\n\nThis was a present, and I was very happy with my old capital, it's having given sterling service for over seven years.

They just don't last as long as you would expect an appliance whose SOLE job it is to heat plain water. When the kettle works, it's perfect for AeroPress coffee and teas that need less than boiling water. It's easy to set the temp you want, and it heats the water quickly.

It works perfectly, quietly, and quickly.\n2 complaints. I wish it were smaller. It'd be great if they made a half size \"personal\" version of this kettle. I never need more than .5L of water, so I hope I'm not doing any damage by only filling it to the minimum line every day.\nSecond complaint is probably common to all metal kettles. The pour lip has a small bump inside where the lip is welded to the body of the kettle. It seems to make the water dribble unpredictably as it pours out (I'd much prefer a smaller, more focused stream). But worse, I can't fill the kettle from my filtered water spout on my refrigerator directly without the water hitting that little lip inside and spraying all over the floor. Maybe I can grind it down sometime when I get the energy.\nBut otherwise, it's great, and the water seems perfectly heated."},{"reviewerName":"Carly","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Reeks of plastic!","reviewDate":"December 26, 2016","reviewText":"I had high hopes for this \"stainless steel\" kettle, but alas it does have plastic parts.

Hopefully they will decide to be known for good customer service.\n\nCuisinart\nattn Phil Schwartz\n150 milford rd.\nEast Windsor NJ 08520\n\nMr. Schwartz,\n\nRecently we purchased a Cuisinart CPK-17 tea kettle from Amazon for almost $100.. After only 2 1/2 months the kettle stopped heating water. We fill the kettle and push the buttons to turn it on. The lights flash like normal but after a minute or so the kettle beeps and turns itself off. I've tried it several times and it's clear that it's broken. I've checked the online reviews on Amazon and almost 1/4 of the reviews list this behavior. It's pretty clear that this is a known problem (or at least a consistent one) with the CPK-17. Is it a design fault? A supplier/construction issue? Hopefully you are reading the online reviews and taking appropriate action to fix this issue.\n\nI called your customer service line and your representative informed me that I would have to pay shipping to return your faulty product. When I told her that I had a problem with this, she said \"check your warranty, you agreed to this\". Now, I understand that the fine print may state anything at all, and technically this *is* the letter of the legal agreement, but in light of the fact that many other companies eat the shipping for their own faulty products, and that so many customers have the same issue with the CPK-17, I strongly feel that you are taking advantage of your customers. True, it's only a measly $7, but it's almost more insulting that the amount is so low. It seems extremely short sighted to sell your reputation so cheaply. Did some bean counter with no thought of customer service or the long term reputation of Cuisinart come up with that number? If so, he or she has done much damage to your reputation for nothing in return.\n\nSo I am writing to let you know that I will no longer be purchasing Cuisinart products. You have treated your customers shabbily and I do not feel that I should reward your company with my patronage.\n\nI hope your reconsider your actions and decide to become a company known for good customer service. It may cost a little more up front (specifically, it may cost you $7), but in return you will be known as a company that values its customers, treats them fairly, and converts them into \"Raving Fans\".\n\n*UPDATE*\nSomeone at the company contacted me and offered to ship me a replacement unit at their cost. So far (2 months) the replacement is working fine. I am updating my rating from one start to 3 stars (neutral). I'm sorry that I had to go through so much trouble to get the company to do the right thing (and be so public about it), but I'm glad they did so in the end. Here's hoping they do away with the silly $7 self-destructive nuisance fee."},{"reviewerName":"Andie","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"... electric kettle as a Christmas gift and we absolutely love it!

Before this I had a cheap plastic kettle that was working perfectly fine for over 3 years but I wanted a cordless and larger capacity kettle. It worked fine for 6 months and we liked different temperature settings. Recently I began to notice that it is taking much longer to boil the water. The kettle would start boiling, pause for a few seconds, work again and pause again until you hear the beeping. I thought it was just my imagination but once my husband noticed the same thing I decided to call Cuisinart.\n\nThe customer representative was very rude and disrespectful. I explained him the situation and he just cut me off to read through the pre-recorded limited warranty crap saying that I have to pay for the shipping both ways if I want a replacement. When I asked how would I know if this is not going to happen again after paying $30 for shipping, his response was \"this is an electronic machine, this can happen anytime, this is an electronic machine\" he must think that I am an Amish who is using an electronic device for the first time in my life.\n\nLong story short, I got him to a point where he agreed to waive their shipping cost but I was so upset with the way he treated me that I am not sure if I want another Cuisinart. Cuisinart should understand that customers do not chose a brand and pay a good amount of money because they are idiots or naive. We want to be treated with respect and kindness since we chose you over so many competitors. I am confident that just like me, many people switched over to another brand because of the way you handle your customers. I rather pay another $60-70 and buy another brand than pay $30 to replace my Cuisinart.

Cuisinart customer service informed me that they would replace but I have to pay for shipping to and from ($35 total). So in short they build a cheap product that stops working after 5 months and I have to pay half the price to replace it. The cost (not price) of this product is around $15 by the time they get it to the US so they give me a new one and I cover the most expensive part of the exchange. The question is what is driving this company to improve its products if the customer carries the bulk of the warranty? Shocking way to treat your customers and a poorly designed bad quality product.

And it was...only not for long. It broke down and stopped heating water before the warranty expired. We've requested and got a replacement from Cuisinart, only to have the second one break down in the same manner after a few months. I won't even mention that the lettering on the buttons has almost completely worn off during the same period.\nConsidering that I have a Cuisinart food processor for more than 15 years now and it still works fine, I'm severely disappointed. I guess their quality control went downhill since then."},{"reviewerName":"JoAnn Sapp","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Wonderful Electric Kettle","reviewDate":"July 14, 2014","reviewText":"Love, Love this Cuisinart Electric Kettle.

We received the new one in the mail after calling twice to see where it was, and finally received it after the second all about a week later. We have been using the second kettle about 3 weeks, and it already has rust on the bottom of the inside of the tank.\n\nWe like the features, but don't want to be drinking out something that rusts.\n\nWe also find the handle awkward, and it is burning hot on the outside so that you can't touch it.

I was previously using a stainless stove top kettle, which made it a bit tricky at times, to get the water to the right temperature for the tea I was brewing. I decided on this one because it does everything I want it to do; boils water quickly and provides various water temperatures for different varieties of tea. It was also at a reasonable price point. I brew whole leaf tea and this makes brewing a fresh cup an absolute breeze! Easy to use, aesthetically pleasing and so far, nothing I would change!\n\nUpdate 4/29/11\nPurchased this Kettle in 10/10\nIt is now going to hit the trash.\nIt no longer heats up at all and I contacted Cuisinart.\nThey will send me a new unit if I pay shipping both ways, no way!\nNot heavily used at all and very disappointed!\nThankfully, I have a traditional stove top kettle to use in it's place.\nEverything made today seems to be so disposable and not made to last.....sad!"},{"reviewerName":"serialquiller","rating":"4.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Pretty Solid but...","reviewDate":"August 18, 2010","reviewText":"I did pretty extensive research before buying an electric kettle. The CPK-17 appealed to me on a few different levels. I liked the design, the materials used and the functionality. Although it's nice to have the option of different temperature settings, it's really only useful if you drink a lot of tea, which I don't. I generally use the \"French Press\" and \"Keep Warm\" settings, and there's also a Boil option (which is the next setting up from French Press). On the design side, it's a great looking appliance made from mostly stainless steel. Of course a big concern of mine is the use of BPA-leaching plastic in many kettles on the market, but there appears to be none on the interior of the CPK-17. The water level, as far as I can see, is covered with another sheet of steel. The only non-steel component I see on the kettle's interior is a silicone nub near the bottom, which nearly all kettles have and which are also heat-resistant. Another thing I like about the CPK-17's design is the 360-degree swivel capability of the kettle while resting on its heating element. And of course, the illuminated water level (on when the kettle is in use) is very attractive - a nice soft blue color. The pouring spout is perfectly-shaped which makes for a fool-proof pour every time. In terms of functionality, the CPK works exactly as advertised. Heat-up time is quick and the controls are responsive.\n\nThe major complaint I have with the CPK-17 is the fact that it's already scaling at the bottom and I've only had the kettle for 2 weeks. To me, this is crazy - especially considering I use filtered water by Multi-pure (one of the most advanced filtration systems available), so the water is as clean as it gets before it even goes into the kettle. No chlorine, no calcium, no lime -- so what's with the scaling deposits already? It's annoying, and I wonder if other owners have had similar issues. Anyway, I'm giving this product 4 stars. To recap...\n\nPros:\n- great design, little if any interior plastic\n- smooth functioning, fast heat-up\n\nCons:\n- Scales easily after only a few uses\n- Pricey"},{"reviewerName":"datrade","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","reviewTitle":"Help our environment, stop selling these kettles.","reviewDate":"September 4, 2016","reviewText":"This kettle keeps heating water for 30 minutes after you start it. It is the default settling, what a huge waste of energy. Think about it every one of these kettles that is sold heats for 30 minutes after use. You have to turn off the keep warm setting, otherwise it continues to heat. I purchased two and will be returning both. I thought I didn't know what I was doing, it continued to boil, the bottom of the cabinet has an unusual amount of condensation. I hope I am wrong but can't find any other explanation.
