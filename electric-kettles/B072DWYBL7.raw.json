The AmazonBasics price was and still is amazing.  We knew we did not want plastic, which is typically at this price point.  The kettles view port for seeing the water is plastic, but thats the only piece that is plastic, outside of the lid and handle.  The operation of the kettle was straight forward and we loved how the boiling base remained behind and the kettle could be taken to the table.  The stainless was also pretty swanky looking and we appeared to have paid way more for something than we did.  It seemed we had fallen in love with our stainless steel beauty.\", Like most relationships, nagging things began to show up.  It never left its wet towel on the floor or refused to put gas in the car, even when empty, but things cropped up., \"Even when fully opened, the lid remains firmly in the way of an average adults hand trying to clean the inside.  When you do manage to get your hand and sponge or cloth inside, you are blindly wiping the interior.  Sometimes you feel like you did an amazing job, look inside, and realize you missed an entire area thats still foggy-looking while the rest of the stainless is sparkling.\", The cord is approximately 24 inches, which is fine, but it has nowhere to go to when not in use.  So this length of cord is always introducing itself to other items on the shelf next to it.  Most times it likes to be a loner and no matter how hard we stuff it in, the cord pops out and dangles from the base\\s perch.  You try to wrap it around the kettle, but at 24 inches, it is not long enough to get a good clinging wrap.  So it again pops out and dangles with a \"How you doin\\?\" to the items below it on the shelf., These pale in comparison to watching the rust begin to form.  Clearly the direct visible bottom is stainless and the seam at its edges is not.  So now add the aggravation of trying to fit your hand in to clean and now trying to do something about the rust.  My photo is after me getting a good wipe for the photo.  The photo is looking down inside and the vertical post is where the handle exists.  Rust is forming at the seam and even where that post connects at the inside bottom., \"For the price, this was a great little kettle.  We had no issues as other reviewers experienced.  It just worked.  It was used on average, once a day.  Wiped clean, the best we could.  And rust where the stainless ends and seam begins.  Can I say I got my moneys worth?  Yes.

In addition to being able to brew myself a hot cuppa, I can now boil my own eggs, cook my own rice, make dried beans edible, and kettle cooked oatmeal and potatoes are on my list of things to try.\", Pros:, -Large, insulated handle. Easy to grip even with my massive hands and sticks out far enough that I can sit the kettle on the edge of my counter with the handle facing outward and then easily scan the edge of the counter top to locate the handle without risk of burning my hand or knocking it off the counter, a vitally important safety feature to the independant blind person., -Easy to fill and just the right size for making kettle cooked meals for one person., -Retains heat well when left close and full of hot water, but cools quickly once empty and nearly instantly if refilled with cold water., -The cord is neither frustratingly long or frustratingly short., -No annoyingly high-pitched beeps., Cons:, -Outer shell gets hot enough to burn., -Opening is a bit narrow for pouring canned goods and makes pouring from a measuring cup a bit tricky. I intend to buy a funnel to address this issue., -It\\s tall, narrow body shape makes stirring contents without being burned by steam difficult.

This issue doesnt seem to extend to say, adding dried beans or rice to already heated water and reheating to a boil.\", \"-Dried beans have a tendency to get stuck between the wall and a mounted on the inside of the kettle and in the corners of the viewing window. Rice just stickes to everything. Also, even with the filter removed, the spout wont allow for pouring rice or beans out, and dumping them by inverting and opening the lead, the lip catches a lot.

I spent a lot of time reading reviews making my choice, reading reviews, and this one seemed the best bang for the buck. I\\ve had it about a week and so far so good. It boils quickly. I typically boil around .5L, the \"minimum\", which takes 2 minutes to come to a full boil that activates the auto-shut off. It starts to bubble at 1.5 minutes. The auto shut-off works like a charm. The on/off lever lights up when the kettle in on and clicks off when the water reaches full boil. The light is large enough to be sign but not large enough to be obnoxious (some of these seem to moonlight as Barbie\\s Dream Disco). The handle does not get hot to the touch. There\\s also a small black disc on the lid that you can use to close it (if you\\re peeking at it before it auto shuts off ) that also does not get hot to the touch. I got this kettle partly because it was smaller, just 1L versus a more typical 1.7L, thinking it would take up less room on my counter. However, I actually think the larger capacity kettles are just taller, not necessarily wider. A friend got me one for a gift (after I had already ordered this one) and even though it\\s 1.7 L, it looks to be about the same size. The kettle isn\\t large, just not significantly smaller than one with almost twice the capacity. The bottom has a place to wrap excess cord which works well enough.

I also like the window so that I can see the water level when Im filling it (which is a feature more quick kettles have though, I think).\", \"There are a few minor things I dont like. For one, the lid doesnt quite fully open and with my particular sink, it gets in the way a little. No big deal. Also, I dont think the pot clicks into the base with the authority I would like. I have a few others (I forget the brands at the moment) that do have a better more secure click, but again this is probably minor since it works and its not going anywhere unless you knock it hard with your hand. Also, the kettle does get hot, so you have to be sure to grab it by the handle. I sometimes forget if it turned water on or not and typically I brush my hand against my plastic (and one double-walled) kettle to see if they feel warm or not.

It will heat 0.5 litres of water to a rolling boil in about 2 minutes. I live with just my husband so this is just fine as we dont need anything large or industrial-strength. If you have a big family or kids that are prone to being rough with kitchen appliances, this might not work for you. It is made of a thin metal alloy and is not reinforced on the outside by a layer of plastic like some more expensive, heftier kettles.\", This kettle is fairly easy to clean, although the lid only opens up to about 60 degrees. If it opened a full 90-degrees or wider, it would be easier to get my hand inside (and I have tiny girl hands)., \"There is a screen before the spout which is not the easiest to remove or replace. Since you are only supposed to boil water in this thing, and not make your tea in it, Im not sure why the screen is necessary. It shouldnt be a problem, as I dont see myself needing to clean it very often at all.\", \"The cord can be wound into the base, making it take up less space. It is nice but I dont like storing electric cables that tightly as they tend to stay kinked and resist straightening and it may place strain on the wires. I used to be a sound technician so am kind of nit-picky when it comes to storage and maintenance of cords and cables.\", \"One thing I dont like is that you are supposed to boil at least 0.5 litres at a time. Since I often only want one cup of tea for myself, Im usually left with more hot water than I need. But all kettles probably have a minimum recommended capacity for the consideration of safety, and is not something particular to this one by AmazonBasics.\", The complaints I have about this kettle are that the thin uncoated housing does get very hot. So be careful not to touch it while it\u2019s heating, or while it contains hot liquid because you could definitely get burned. This makes this kettle not a good choice for households with small children., Because this kettle is rated at 1500 watts (same as a space heater), it can overwork your household breakers if you\u2019ve got it plugged into the same outlet as another appliance. I had to reset the breaker for my kitchen one time because of that. Since then I\u2019ve been cognizant of making sure I plug it into its own outlet whenever I use it., Lastly, the material on the bottom has started to discolor (see pic). It hasn\u2019t affected flavor and does not appear to be coming off, so I don\u2019t think it is harmful., In summary, this is just an OK kettle. It has some problems, with the potential to burn users at the top of my concerns.

Granted, my Ovente is not brand-spanking new, but its larger capacity might mean that it would have an edge in this comparison., \"Stylewise, I feel the Amazon kettle is nothing to write home about; it looks nice enough, but its just utilitarian in looks. On the counter, I think it looks much nicer than the plastic Ovente, and of course its footprint is smaller as well.\", Aside from the heating time, the other primary functional things about a pot like this are how it opens and the on/off switch. The Ovente opens by pushing the dot on the top of the lid, which I like, and then has the power switch on the handle. I like this layout. The Amazon has the lid opening on the handle and the power switch under the handle. I know lots of these pots have the powerswitch under the handle, but it feels a bit awkward to me. When \"opened\" using the switch, the Amazon pot doesn\\t fully open, however, it\\s got enough room to manually open the last bit, so that the lid is 90-degrees to the rest. I\\ve used another electric kettle that wouldn\\t open that last bit and was then hard to clean, so this is good.

I almost didnt get this as it had fake reviews. I gave in and turns out, that it is good reviews are true and is probably worth more than what it costs. I initially bought the Proctor Silex and didnt like how everything is made out of plastic. So I got this one and so far I am impressed from day 1.\", Design and build:, The build quality of this kettle feels heavy duty from the plastic, weight, and how everything is put together. Everything feels sturdy including the lid which seems to flips up seamlessly. The open button is a button type mechanism where you just push down until the lid pops open. It has a reasonable weight at around 1.5 pounds for the main body and .25 pounds for the base station if you care to transport this around., This Kettle is made of part stainless steel and plastic. The only plastic material that is in contact with water is the water line indicator and the lid plastic lining inside. The plastic material is advertised as \"BPA\" free, and it does not have any sort of plastic smell out of box and after boiling water. Inside the kettle is a concealed heating element on the bottom which is flat with a mirror finish., \"The base station seems to be built less sturdy. The only part that is metal on this base are the sides which is just lined with stainless steel strip. The rest of the body is plastic from the bottom up. The plastic has a bit of flex to it and could crack if you drop it on a hard surface. It should not be an issue at all if you dont move it that much.\", As this kettle is made of Stainless Steel, the body can get quite hot to touch after boiling. The single metal layer body is the least ideal material to retain its heat for next left over use. This will only keep water warm for about 1-3 hours depending how hot you like your drinks. Thankfully there is a plastic circle on the middle of the lid so you can close it with your finger., Performance:, This kettle holds 1 Liter of water and heats up with 1500 watts of power. Most other kettles uses 1000 watts of power which is slower to boil by 1-2 mins (in my experience with the Proctor Silex). In my test, this boils a full container of water in 4 mins, half container in about 3 mins, and about 2 mins for the minimum amount. Since I live in a relatively high elevated area (Las Vegas Nevada) from sea level, water boils here at 208f, instead of 212f at sea level. So performance varies depending where you live., The heating system is branded with Strix British thermostat as shown in pictures on the base station. I was afraid that this kettle uses an unbranded or generic thermostat since no one seemed to provide info about it. This company has been making thermostat for temperature regulators in kettles for decades and tested for quality, so this brings my mind at peace about safety., This kettle auto turns off flawlessly if used as intended. This however does NOT auto turn off when the lid open and continues to boil water until the lid is closed or turn off manually. The extended time of boiling does not seem to improve the temps when comparing temps to auto shut off runs., The on and off switch is lighted and protrudes about 1 inches long. It has a good amount of resistance to turn it on while requires less force to turn off manually. The orange LED amber glow is is easy to see in sun bright areas which I like. As you could turn this device on manually, I would not obviously run this when it has no or little water. The plate on the mirror plate on the bottom tends to discolor if there is no water to transfer heat to., As for the amount of noise this makes when boiling water, I would say it is on the loud side. Louder than the Proctor Silex. It is much louder than a filter coffee brewer which sounds like heavy rain hitting the roof of a house. This of course is a trade off for fast boilers that uses 1500 watts of power. This may not be suitable for enviornments that require low sound to avoid bothering others., This kettle will inevitably leave some powder or rust marks as you use it more. This is left over minerals left by boiling or evaporated water called water scaling. I do have some signs of it after using it for several weeks. Given that this is a flat bottom heating element, all you have to do is pour vinegar, let it sit, and it will to dissolve calcium deposits and the rust looking stains. These stains varies depending where you live and if your hard/tap water is soften or filtered., Final thoughts:, \"I would recommend this kettle for someone who wants a small capacity for 1 -3 people, and/or boils just a cup of water in 2 mins at the lowest capacity. This kettle is just enough to boil water for noodles AND a cup of a tea or french press coffee. I havent used it long enough, but for  the price you get for quality parts and design, I would say this is absolutely worth it.\""}, {"reviewerName": "Francesca V.", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "reviewTitle": "Attractive kettle.", "reviewDate": "July 30, 2019", "reviewText": "\"Growing up in England, we ALWAYS had an electric kettles I was excited when I had the opportunity to review this product.

The lid doesnt open as wide as my previous kettle, and it was a little hard to get my hand in there to clean before using it.\", After cleaning it, I filled it up to the max with water and pushed the little power button down to start heating the water. It took exactly 7 minutes an 46 seconds for my water to boil and for it to automatically shut off. The kettle is then removed from the base for easy pouring as the cord is attached and coils around the base. There is a button on the handle that you push on to open the lid which is an upgraded feature from my previous kettle that had to be manually pulled open., \"The handle is made of a heat proof plastic did not heat up like the rest of the appliance.

It\u2019s almost like a hotel coffee maker in that there\u2019s just one button that lights up orange as it\u2019s going and then when it\u2019s done boiling it just shuts itself off. It\u2019s really so easy to figure out so I\u2019d feel ok in gifting to an elderly family member as long as boiling water isn\u2019t a safety concern. Definately safer than boiling on a gas stove though and bc it shits itself off could be a great safer solution for an elderly mom who loves tea., Only thing I didn\u2019t love was that the top of the inside is curled in so that if you were to brew tea or something right inside it the leaves or anything would get caught right in there and would be hard to clean out.

They both work well, and there are advantages and disadvantages to both styles.  For this style, the primary advantage is the \u201cwindow\u201d that shows the measurements of water in the kettle and also lets you see exactly when it starts boiling.  Yes, it does shut off after it starts to boil, but it takes a good 20 seconds or more, and sometimes I am definitely in too big a hurry.  It also is lighter in weight than the double wall.  The primary disadvantage is that the exterior gets very hot., With a double wall, you can\u2019t have the window, but the exterior stays much cooler.  That could be important for folks with little kids or pets who get where they ought not.  However, the double wall makes it heavier, so inconvenient for some folks., I decided to go with this one as I really, really like the window and I don\u2019t care about the hot exterior.  It\u2019s also very fast., My only complaint, for which I am deducting one star in my rating, is that the cord is very, very short, only about 26 inches.  Manufacturers claim that makes it safer (although I assume it really is just because it is cheaper for them), but for those of us who live in very old apartments with designed-by-a-man kitchens with very few and very hard-to-reach outlets, it actually makes it more likely to cause injury.

I was impressed by how quickly the water boils. It seems like a better way to boil my tea water than the microwave. I gave it 4 stars because the lid does not open completely and the pot gets very hot, just like a pan would. I put my fingers on the body of the pot and it was uncomfortable. As I was wiping out the kettle, I was worried I might break the lid off. If you are careful of the lid, this is a very fast kettle.

Idk if its because Ive used it every day since I got it or what, I did the vinegar treatment per the instruction manual but it didnt help much.
