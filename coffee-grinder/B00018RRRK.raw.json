So, we had to replace it and why not go with the same unit when we had such great success using it to grind our daily coffee?! This is a very nice burr mill that we have gained much use from over the years and now we replace it with a brand new unit that is exactly like the other one and hoping we get another 8-10 years out of it.\n\nWhy do we like it?\n* It has a nice look with the majority being shiny stainless steel housing.\n* The hopper on the top holds a half pound of beans.\n* You have a choice of 6 settings for every type of grind you choose.\n* It does great on coarse grind for our French Press coffee, very uniform.\n* You hit the button and it stops when it is done grinding.\n* Once you figure out what grind you like, how much you want and what setting you prefer it is a simple process and then you just have to decide what kind of bean you want in there. It does the rest.\n* It is fairly easy to clean up, doesn't take up too much space and best of all it works great and does it all quite fast.\n\nIf either of us had anything negative to say about it, we'd have to say it is loud, but then if you aren't hand grinding, what isn't loud when it comes to grinding coffee via electricity?\n\nWe're happy with the product or we wouldn't have purchased a second one of the same exact type eight years after the first one. Plus, it must be others feel the same because eight years later the company is still making the same model! Hope if you get one you like it!"

            "reviewText": "I wanted to get a burr grinder to make cold brew coffee. I needed coarse grounds. This grinder produces the coarse grounds well, but it also seems to pulverize some coffee into a fine powder no matter what the coarseness is set to. This isn't great because now my cold brew ends up with a lot of sediment in it, and I've actually been filtering the final product through a paper filter as well just to get all the extra fine grounds out of the brew.\nI think the possible reason for the pulverization is the high speed the grinder spins at. I might take it apart to see if there is something I can do to slow it down.\nI had to edit down to 2 stars. Just started another brew and paid close attention to the grinds. It blew me away by how much fine powder was in the bin. Going to order a hand powered grinder to have something to compare this to. As-is I don't find this acceptable.\n\nEdit 8/12/17: Added a photo of the grind on the most coarse setting. You can see the nice grinding on the right, and the fine powder that is always present. Grinder would probably be fine for drip coffee, or another paper filter method."

            "reviewText": "Products like this are tough to review because it's all about getting what you pay for. You can't give a Ford Escort one star because it doesn't ride like a Cadillac. :)\n\nIn this case, we have one of the lowest price mill grinders you can get. My prior coffee grinding has been with blade grinders. I had been shaking them gently while grinding just to get better uniformity. I've been through 3 blade grinders in 3 years due to broken blades, or warn out lid switches, etc.\n\nThis time I decided to try a mill grinder and found this one. I wasn't ready to spend $150+ to grind my coffee (as much as I love my coffee a certain way). After using this product a few times, here are my observations:\n\nNEATNESS. It is true that it is messier than using the blade grinders I used before. It is a bit dusty. However, I have been able to minimize this issue after grinding using the following steps: (a) leaning the grinder forward and tapping the back, (b) gently pulling out the filled grind bin, (c) covering the opening with my hand (leaving the lid on), tilting the bin at an angle, and tapping again on the counter to make a nice pile for pouring, then (d) removing the lid and pouring directly into the coffee grind basket of the coffee pot, lightly tapping the bin. Even doing this, it's a little dusty, but not horrible.\n\nGRIND UNIFORMITY. Grind uniformity isn't amazing, but it's way better than a blade grinder.\n\nCONTROLS. The number-of-cups switch, which is really just a way of setting the automatic grinding time, is way off. At least the way I like my coffee (which is about a tablespoon of whole beans per 6oz coffee pot cup). For me, I have to take the number of tablespoons of beans I'm using, multiply by 3, and that's the approximate timer setting. So for 6 \"cups\" that's max setting on the timer of 18. For more cups, I have to run it twice. I think there's much room for inexpensive improvement for the product in this area. The timer should be much more generous. Also, to turn it off manually, you have to slide the switch to the off position. It would be more convenient if pressing the START button was really a START/STOP, but not a huge deal...\n\nMAINTENANCE. I could imagine that if I ground a variety of flavored coffees in this machine, it would be a bit of a hassle to clean it between each change-over. It does leave some grind and chunks behind. But for me, I'm pretty much consistent in the type of coffee I use, so no biggy for me. I do clean it out anyone once in awhile. The nice thing about the unit is that the removable pieces are dishwasher safe.\n\nMORE MAINTENANCE: There are several negative reviews that have said that their Cuisinart DBM-8 just stopped working after some time. Mine did exactly that after approximately 2-1/2 years of use. I decided to take the unit apart and found that, over the course of 2-1/2 years of grinding coffee a couple of times per day, there were a lot grounds into the cavity of the grinder workings compartment (see[...]). This comes from \"blow back\" of grounds when grinding beans back through the exit shute of the grinder. A little bit blows back on each grind, and how much probably depends upon how finely you grind your coffee. (We grind ours at about 30% of way around the indicator, from the finest position). In the 2-1/2 years, the unit accumulated at least 8-12 dry ounces of coffee grounds. It resulted in the slider switch being insulated and never allowing the unit to turn on. After cleaning out all the grounds and using a Q-tip to gently wipe the slider switch with 91% isopropyl, the unit works fine again.\n\nMy recommendation is, if you are mechanically inclined, take the unit apart every 6 months or so and clean out all the coffee grounds. That would include both the bottom cavity and the top cavity (they are accessed separately). The bottom cavity is accessible by pulling off the replaceable rubber feet and removing 4 screws. To get to the top cavity, you need to remove 4 screws that you can see recessed deep in the bottom cavity (you'll need a long stem, small or medium Phillips head screwdriver). There's another screw near the top where the grounds container goes. So that's 5 screws to get to the top cavity. You'll need to take out 4 more screws to remove the slider and push-button circuit card so you can clean it up before re-attaching it.\n\nA possible design improvement for the unit would be a better seal or some kind of gasket around the small, square connection between the grinder and the grounds bin."

They even asked me what kind of beans I had putting in the grinder. Apparently, Starbucks beans are too greasy for it and cause it to clog. Does it say that anyway in the instructions? Not that I could find. I am VERY unhappy about having to pay to return a faulty product the second time. The first time- I had to cut the cord and pay $10. I now have $30.52 into a replacement grinder. When this is resolved, IF they resolve it - I will NEVER buy another Cuisinart Grinder again. They are seriously lacking in their customer service!"

            "reviewText": "I wanted to love this coffee grinder. I have used it for three weeks, but I'm finally giving up. I liked that it had a reservoir for beans, but that turned out to be the only positive feature. My issues were:\n\n-The noise. It is hard to describe how loud the sound is. The only thing I can compare it to is when I enter the workshop while my husband is cutting wood on the saw and I can't even shout to him; I just have to wait until he's done. It's that level of volume, and it has some of the saw sound's high-pitched quality that is the LAST thing you are prepared to hear in the morning before you have had coffee.\n\n-The time. It takes a weirdly long time to grind the beans. Maybe that's just a burr grinder for you, but coupled with the unacceptably loud sound, it's a horribly long wait.\n\n-The mess. Somehow this grinder creates a wild amount of static. I have no idea why, but it means that the grinds don't pour cleanly into your pot for brewing. They flutter, they fan, they stick to the outside of the grinder and to the outside of the pot. And they stick INSIDE the grinder so you have to get in there with the brush end of your bean scooper and try to free all the stuff that's stuck to the side.\n\n-The grind. I have mine set all the way to espresso-size fine, and I still see large hunks of beans. Perhaps a fine grind is just my personal preference, but I don't see how big chunks of unground beans are going to make a cup of coffee for anybody."

            "reviewText": "A large proportion of product reviews, whether positive or negative, are subjective declarations of personal tastes that are either met or not. Likes and preferences are debatable. What is not debatable is the fact that the grinder that I purchased failed to operate 10 weeks after I first started using it. Dead, nothing, zero.\n\nI had been grinding a measured amount of beans sufficient for one mug-full of coffee daily. I consistently cleaned the grind chamber after each use and thoroughly cleaned the bean hopper, burr grinding plates and the grind release area once weekly.\n\nThis product, The Cuisinart DBM-8 Supreme Grind Automatic Burr Mill, has long been criticized for:\n-Noisy during operation: Short of taking a reading with a decibel meter, I found it to be unacceptably loud. But that is my opinion.\n-The grind size is inconsistent on all settings: Not that much of a problem for me but again, subjective on my part.\n-The grinding times are not dependable: Even when set for the longest grinding time, the burr mill would routinely stop before completely grinding the 35g of beans that I had pre-measured. Since I never relied on this feature to begin with, that this function routinely failed to operate correctly was an annoyance but not an important feature for me.\n\nThe mediocre performance of this machine gave me little user satisfaction but I was at least able to make a decent cup of coffee with the fresh grounds that it so ineptly produced. Despite this machine's considerable number of flaws, I would not have reviewed this product had it at least continued to work. I would have lived with the sub-entry-level-grinder deficiencies that plague this machine which at this price point are not unreasonable to expect.\n\nThat the Cuisinart DBM-8 Supreme Grind Automatic Burr Mill utterly failed after such a short period of light usage and regular care and that so many others reported having had a similar experience, are the facts that I cannot overlook. These are facts that I believe to be worthy of your consideration before making this purchase my friends."

I will call Cuisinart tomorrow.\n\nUpdate: I called Cuisinart... the rep was nice and said it is under warranty. They will ship a new one to me. I was told I have to pay $10 to ship the old back! I protested and said I will use other shipper which is cheaper than UPS. The fee is waived but I have to bring it to a shipper to ship it back. Buyer beware!!!

I don't care of the other grinds, so this comparison is only on how it works for them. In a nut shell, the grounds for this were EXACTLY the same as the hard earned grounds from the hand crank burr grinder. Perfect for an espresso. In case you were wondering, the cheap blade grinder, no espresso setting came out exactly as course as the brew pre-ground grounds you buy from the store.\n\nI included some pictures with measurements of this machine, and a comparison of the results. On the upper left are the cheap blade grinder grounds, lower left pre-ground bag grounds, and on the upper right this machine and lower right the hand crank burr.\n\nAlso, I only did two scoops (scoop included) which is enough for one shot of espresso. I just put it on the espresso setting at the lowest 4 cups. No problems with the very small amount. The catch cup has a lid, so be careful when you take it off to pour the grounds out (use a corner, not a flat side) straight into the deal to pack for espresso. There is static, so some grounds do stick in the bucket, but actually less than in the cheap blade grinder. This is easy to rinse out.\n\nI don't know of course how long this will last, like any modern appliance it is mostly plastic. But it looks like it's fairly well made and treated well shouldn't have a problem. Until this breaks (and I'll update if it does soon) I would HIGHLY recommend this as a great grinder for the price point. If this review helped you, please click below and let others know!"

I don\u2019t touch the slider to change the length of the grind and it never grinds the same amount of coffee twice in a row.\n\nI bought this to replace a Baratza grinder that I've had for many years. It served me very well but finally had an electrical issue and for the cost to repair it, I was able to get this grinder. My model of Baratza doesn't seem to be made anymore, but it looks exactly like the Encore that you can buy on Amazon for $139. I certainly didn't pay that kind of money for it way back when. I really liked the Baratza except for two things. It was very messy (grounds got everywhere in the vicinity of where it lived) and the knob fell off with almost every use. So how about this one?\n\nPros\nClean. Yay! the design of the grind chamber with a lid on it and a small opening to where the grounds come out of the grinder means the grounds stay in the chamber. Thank you designers \u2013 that\u2019s a massive improvement.\n\nCons\nIt\u2019s been impossible to set the time (number of cups) for the grind with the little slider consistently. I make a big pot of coffee first thing in the morning and then single cups in a smaller pot a couple of times later in the day. I could never get the same amount ground for the two pot sizes as I set it back and forth. I never had this problem with the Baratza. I\u2019ve finally just decided to leave it at one spot and run two cycles for the first pot and then a single cycle for the singles. My big pot is bigger than two times the single serving pot, so I either have to go light on the big pot or heavy on the singles. I do the latter (cuz I really like it strong first thing in the morning) but that means I\u2019m using more coffee than I really need for the later singles. I suppose I could grind more than I need and just measure out the right amount for each pot, but hey \u2013 fresh ground coffee, isn\u2019t that the point?\n\nI like my coffee strong. I use a French press and a lot of coffee per pot. So a coarse setting and a setting of about 8 cups for my big pot. That fills the chamber almost half full. The slider goes up to 18 cups. If you set it to that, you\u2019d overfill the chamber and I\u2019m not sure how the grinder would deal with that. On the Baratza, the maximum turn of the knob only filled the chamber about two-thirds. The importance of this is if you need to grind up a bunch of coffee for a vacation trip (I don't take my grinder with me). It seems like Cuisinart could have designed that slider to be a lot more robust and easy to set over a range of grind times that aligned better with the chamber.\n\nThe grind chamber is not the best shape for pouring. So even though it\u2019s now clean around my grinder for the first time in forever, I tend to spill some of the grounds when I pour them into the pot. The shape of the Baratza grind chamber was better in that regard.\n\nMy last con is a weird design thing. The hopper for the beans is round at the bottom but angling outward to square at the top (the Baratza hopper is round bottom to top). You rotate the whole hopper to set the coarseness of the grind. With the grind I use, that means that the grinder looks off-kilter. If you\u2019re OCD about symmetry, this would drive you crazy. You\u2019d probably have to rotate it to align symmetrically after each grind and then move it back to your coarseness setting for each grind. I\u2019m not OCD about symmetry, but it does look kinda weird sitting on the counter \u2013 like there\u2019s something amiss.\n\nOn balance this grinder seems to be okay. Hopefully it will give me the many years of multiple-times-a-day service that the Baratza did.\n\nJuly 2019 update: gave up the ghost (electrically) today, so it lasted less than 2 years."

Shipping cost to the return center comes out to be around $12, and there is no option to purchase a prepaid label from Cuisinart at a lower rate. Furthermore, we were also instructed to include a $10 check/money order to cover for the return shipping. Altogether we will be spending an additional $22 just to receive a replacement for a defective product that we only worked for 2 months. Terrible Customer experience, I will not recommend this product to anyone.

Yes, there were a few bigger pieces that got through somehow (see the picture) on the finest setting and some small stuff that got out (probably just got jammed between the wheels and another coffee bean) for the larger, french-press setting, but all-in-all, 95% or better of what came out was exactly the size set on the wheel. You're not going to get that from a bladed chopper...and if you're grinding beans for anything other than a drip coffee maker, having that consistency really matters in the cup.\n\nYes...it's loud...but it's not that much louder than a bladed chopper, and to get a good, uniform grind, it's well worth it.\n\nI like that there are so many grind-size settings. Some machines can be very finicky about the grind size...just a bit too small or a bit too large and you get something less than it could be giving you. With this burr grinder, you can literally dial in the exact grind size that makes the perfect cup of coffee...the one that tastes best to you.\n\nSure, you can spend $15 less and get a bladed chopper, and I used one for years...until I got a burr grinder for a Christmas present one year. That one finally wore out (I work from home, so I use the grinder A LOT!) and there was no way I was going to get anything but a burr grinder again.\nGo ahead and spend the money...get this grinder. You'll thank yourself within days once you have that perfect setting dialed in and are getting the best-tasting coffee you've ever made."

There I opened a small coffee shop to supplement my savings while I lived there, and for the adventure of doing so. Now I had an older, single group, commercial espresso machine that I bought (very) used, and a (very) small budget. As such I did not want to buy a commercial grinder. I bought this very same model from a brick and mortar store for $50 and took it, fingers crossed. It worked flawlessly, making beautiful ground espresso, and in much greater volume than you will at home. I had seating for 20, and didn't close until after midnight on weekends (packed until closing with young people drinking coffee and having a good time). I did this for 5 months. I did well enough to have money to buy tacos after expenses. When I left to return to the U.S. I sold off my equipment. I have a smaller, non commercial, espresso machine these days, and I make a lot less coffee at home. When I seen this on Amazon, I did not hesitate to buy it."

Go ahead, left your DBM-8 to your ear, turn it a little bit, don't you hear those plastic bits falling around inside of it?\n\nI bought one of these, but, because they are such poorly made devices, I am now on my third (technically, though I never actually laid hands on the second).\n\nThe first one broke after a few grinds. It ground, then ground to a halt, never again to grind.\nHot tip! Get your replacement through Amazon, who will do it for free, and not Cuisinart, who will charge you $10.\n\nThe replacement DBM-8 was shipped to me, but never arrived, some snafu of UPS sent it back to Amazon, sight unseen. So Amazon shipped me a third. Kudos to Amazon for excellent support here.\n\nI waited to place this review. I wanted to see if the first broken unit was the exception, not the rule. The new one arrived around January 2019. It lasted until today, Sep 26, 2019, where it ground to a halt after some tens of grinds. RIP DBM-8.\n\nThe thing is, I generally perceive Cuisinart as a quality brand. Food choppers of all forms mostly. But this experience shows me that they will slap their name on the worst quality of manufacturing garbage to take your $36 and leave you wanting.\n\nDo not buy this machine. Think twice about buying anything from Cuisinart ever again. Clearly the brand quality is not what it used to be.\n\nI will now go order some much more expensive grinder made by whose brand is not Cuisinart, not because I want to pay more, but because I want one that works and has more mechanical staying power than an egg shell.\n\nYou have been warned."

Just imagine having to grind your coffee every day just for that one or two cups, end up with expresso grounds (and unground beans) in your coffee maker, when you really needed a grind for a drip machine....\nThis grinder is exceptional in service, has several levels of grind possibilities, takes 1/2 lb of beans at a time, and only takes a few minutes to fill up a container of ground coffee ready to go- wake up to the smell of delicious coffee and not have to fuss with the grinding noise of a cheap machine that doesn't give you what you want.\nBuy it Now- by the way, no one paid me to write this review.

            "reviewText": "No assembly required, other than to unwrap everything. I\u2019d advise a wash of the hopper and the coffee collection box, just to be sure. This will mean getting the hopper off the base\u2026I had to refer to the manual for that. So, it was clean and ready to go in about ten minutes.\n\nIt\u2019s fully intuitive, if you know anything about coffee. It\u2019s easy to tell where the beans go on, where they come out, how to fine-tune your grind and how much you want, and to turn it on. The instructions are great on all of this, and then some, but it\u2019s easy to set up and get right into production. And it\u2019s not huge, and looks good on the countertop.\n\nIt\u2019s loud, that\u2019s for sure. There is no subtlety in the way this thing works\u2014you\u2019re not going to surprise anyone in the morning with freshly ground coffee.\n\nYou get a wide range of settings for grind, from very fine to coarse. The fine is not quite powder, but it is mighty fine, so make sure your filter/mesh accommodates before you go too fine with your grind.\n\nBest keep the lid on, so that when you get to the last few beans you don\u2019t get them hopping up and out of the hopper\u2026which happens. The grinder does work when the hopper lid is off. That means there is no safety mechanism; if it\u2019s plugged in, it\u2019s ready to grind. There is a small plastic dome over the grinding area, but there is plenty of room for fingers or utensils to get in there, so be careful.\n\nHave no fear that you\u2019ll overfill the grind collection box. With the hopper full to the brim and the 18-cup selection made, you\u2019re still only going to get less than half of the beans ground, and that will fill only about half of the box. With a completely full hopper you will have to go to the max-cup setting at least three times to get it all ground up.\n\nThe ground coffee box is nice and compact, and is suitable to put right into the fridge or the freezer, as there is a small gasket on the top which keeps the lid nicely in place. But the small rectangular opening that lets the ground coffee in does not seal in any way.\n\nThe coffee box is not really optimally shaped for pouring the ground coffee out. Your best bet is to go with a spoon or a scoop. A design improvement would be a pouring spout/beak on the box so that you could gently pour the ground coffee right into your coffeemaker.\n\nDocumentation: You get a quick reference guide, in English and Spanish. This suffices to get things moving right away, and in the cleaning section it\u2019ll tell you how to remove the hopper. You get a clever registration brochure, where you can take and text in a photo, which will allow them to immediately capture your phone for future marketing purposes. Or you can email your photo\u2026which gives them your email address. Or you can register online.\n\nThe \u201cinstruction book\u201d is a multi-fold pamphlet. The text is very clear, as are the diagrams and their annotations. There is a customer service phone number, and a physical address for mailing. The flip side is in Spanish.\n\nFor assistance, there is a help URL and a text number to ask for help. No phone number.\n\nPrice: At approximately $38, this is a big jump up from your standard little canister grinder at $10 or even less. This is a nice one to have on the counter, and is a good investment for folks drinking a lot of coffee, especially for folks who like different kinds of grinds and/or are making coffee in different ways. I think that this price is fair for the product.\n\nBottom Line: If you\u2019re really into coffee and you want some variation on the grind that comes out, this is a good item to invest in."

I contacted cuisinart through their \"contact form,\" but after a week I hadn't heard back and I really needed to solve this problem. I then called cusinart twice. The first conversation I had was with someone who kept repeating that my grinder only had an 8 month warranty and I was outside of that window, and that I should return it to Amazon because they sold me a bad product. The second call I had to convice cuisinart that it wasn't Amazon's fault the grinder didn't work, and they reluctantly agreed that they would ship me out a new product if I returned the old product's cut cord at my own expense. After contacting Amazon, who, in turn contacted cusinart with me on the line. Cuisinart told us that I had to pay for shipping for the outgoing replacement unit AND the shipping to return the cut cord of the bad unit.\n\nFor Amazon's part, my customer service Rep Narumi, who listened to my third conversation with Cuisinart, was very understanding and made me feel better about the situation. But to some up, I won't be replacing anything with a cusinart unit ever again.\n\nAlso, if anyone has a recommendation for a good burr grinder, I'm all ears. :)"

For drip or French Press, works great. If grinding for Espresso or Turkish style coffee, I would not recommend. The grinder is on the loud side, so if you don't want to wake up your house mates in the morning you may want to skip this grinder. As for me, I have preground espresso roast that I buy from the store and all of the people I live with are out of the house by the time I grind my coffee. From what research I have done on BURR style grinders, there really is no other option in the price range of the Cuisinart DBM-8 that will solve the problems mentioned above. For the espresso purist or some one concerned about noise of the machine I would recommend spending more for a higher quality grinder.

I ended up with the DeLonghi Dedica (lots of adjustments from the Saeco to the DeLonghi, some good, some not so good, but that's another review). Anyhow, this inexpensive Cuisinart grinder model has worked as well for me as the $300 conical burr grinders that friends have, so I decided - why mess with a good thing? Hence, my third one.

In accommodating those few _home_users_ who brew 32 cups and the folks who want to grind a few pot's worth at a time, the majority get far less chance to conveniently get the desired result. So, it's easy to complain, but I'll propose a solution which wouldn't cost much. Simply cut the range in half. Easy to do with the analog timer. This way you serve the majority, ( I could dial in 18 seconds, reasonably close) and the quantity brewers could simply hit the button a couple times. That would also give the motor a break. Big upside, little downside. I haven't opened the unit yet, but I may, just to have what I bought the unit for, an automatic grind in the morning. The rest of the things people complain about aren't easy to address and for the most part are just the nature of the beast. And custom silicon to count more precisely (line frequency counter) would be another way. But I think a component change is the way to go."

That's great value for the money, as far as I am concerned. We're hoping to get at least the same performance from this one.\n\nThe grinder can be adjusted easily for various grinds from very coarse to very fine. The top-loading hopper is large enough to hold enough beans that you won't be having to fill it too often. it's easy enough to clean the top hopper and the container for the ground coffee. Noise level is what I'd expect for this sort of appliance.\n\nTwo changes would improve it: First, it would be even easier to clean if the top hopper was in two parts. Removing it for cleaning requires unscrewing it from the base, which loses your grind setting. So separating the top hopper into two parts, one of which was only the hopper itself, would make cleaning easier and slightly more convenient. The second is that the container for the ground coffee might be hard to remove and replace for people with grip impairment. Adding some ridges to the sides of the molded plastic container would make that easier."

So bad in fact, the only rational explanation was that the creator's ex-wife ran off with a Starbucks barista and since then, he's had it out for coffee drinkers everywhere.\n\nCoffee grinders have one job to do -- grind coffee at a measured amount with an evenly ground particle size. Inexplicably, this coffee grinder does neither. The gravity fed design of this coffee grinder makes it impossible to pour in a pre-measured amount of coffee and assume you'll have all of it ground on the other end because it requires the pressure of other beans to push the ones you want ground to go through the grinder. Instead, whole coffee beans pop out like a popcorn maker if you forget to put the lid on it.\n\nAs far as the grind, this product grinds beans as evenly as a heavy set man just jumping up and down on beans on the kitchen floor. I can attest because i am such a man and my stomping grind was more even than the grind produced by this machine. My wife would say I'm a lot more expensive but YMMV.\n\nWorst of all is the static electricity that this device produces such that once the beans are ground, when you open the resulting container, an exploding haze of coffee particles engulf your kitchen making a mess. There is nothing a middle aged man, groggy from a night's sleep, enjoys more than cleaning an entire kitchen, especially before his morning cup of joe. This product leaves a kitchen looking like it was rampaged by a family of black bears, hellbent on dispersing coffee particles around the kitchen in pursuit of wild salmon.\n\nI did give it one star for the public performance art aspect of this product. Historians will look back at this product and wonder how a society that discovered nuclear fission and the secrets of DNA made such a disastrous product. If you are a tea drinker with a grudge, I suggest you send one as a gift"

This grinder produces a fine dust along with even the most coarse grind setting, but I suppose that probably happens with other grinders as well. The timer is kind of pointless, unless you guess perfectly how long the machine needs to grind the amount of beans you put the in the hopper. It's on the loud side, but I'd assume that most grinders are pretty noisy anyway. As other reviews brought up, there is an issue of static cling with the grinds (mostly the fine, powdery stuff) sticking to the canister; but it's really not that big of a deal. Overall, I think I'm going to be happy with this grinder. We'll probably see what else is out there when it comes time to replace though.\nAlso, this grinder doesn't employ the same type of burr that you'd see in a hand grinder. Rather, it's 2 toothed plates which crush/grind the bean between them. Obviously this is still considered a \"burr\" style though."

But ever since moving to the Pacific Northwest, though, I have gotten in to freshly roasted whole bean coffees from the many local roasteries (as there are many here). They usually grind the beans for you depending on what you plan on doing with the coffee. However, I did a mail order purchase from a local vendor, and did not realize it was whole bean when ordering. When it arrived, I immediately realized my mistake to my dismay. I then broke down and bought this grinder after doing some research for the best sort of grinder for pour-over or French press styles of coffee. As this is a burr mill grinder, this was shown to be the best sort per my readings. As the price was right, I ordered the grinder. It arrived the next day, and I had it up, running, and grinding away in less than 10 minutes! Very easy to use, and I made some excellent pour-over coffee with my single-sourced, rain forest certified Guatemalan coffee! I then found out later on from a co-worker that she has this same model but was over 10 years old. It finally broke, and they had JUST ordered the exact same coffee grinder. So this little fact about the potential longevity made me more at ease with my purchase as well. If you need a really great coffee bean grinder for pour-over or French press styles of coffee, then this is the one!"

Still messy, but at least the stray grounds are falling into the sink and not into the water reservoir of my coffee pot.\n\nMy only complaint is the reason for subtracting one star and I've uploaded some photos here to illustrate. On the bottom of the reservoir that catches the coffee grounds is a lip, you might even call it a \"base\", that extends beyond the reservoir on all sides except its back side. Perhaps it doesn't go across the back side because that would make it too difficult to place into the grinder? Anyway, as you can hopefully see in my photos, the bottom back of mine has chipped off on both sides. This design leaves this reservoir at it weakest on the two most vulnerable contact points where it needs to be strongest. The grinder still works properly but I worry about the longevity of this plastic reservoir component based on the \"wear and tear\" damage I've observed after one year in service. I will update this review again if the condition worsens.\n\nOriginal Review Title: \"Still on Honeymoon\"\n\nUpdate - March 2016 - I've used this for a year now and haven't encountered any mechanical issues.

It has been used daily for just over a month at the time of this review and if I should encounter durability issues in the future I will update my review. There is a lot to like about this grinder and as of this writing I'm happy with the purchase. I only have one dislike to report so far and that's the design of the grind chamber. I find it difficult to replace back into the grinder and I don't think the square shape is conducive to emptying grounds directly into a coffee filter basket without creating a bit of a mess. Hopefully in time it will get easier. But that aside, I'm happy overall with this purchase and hope that will be the case long after the honeymoon is over."

It grinds the beans according to the setting, the grounds cup is easy to snap in & out, hopper is easy to clean, looks nice, and doesn't take up much counter space.

The flavor of the ground coffee is great, but this is not Cuisinart's best product, and I own quite a few. The mess, measuring, and lack of airtight containers are my biggest complaints. Overall, an ok (but not fantastic) grinder. I don't think saving a little money on this grinder was worth the extra hassle. If I was to buy another burr grinder I'd choose one that kept the beans in an airtight container and eliminated the mess and measuring issues. For more details about these issues keep reading.\n\nMeasuring:\nIt's not easy to get the exact amount of beans ground. I alternate between using a french press, and using a drip machine, and depending on how many cups you'll be making, it requires experimentation to get the correct amount. Often there is a bit leftover in the collection container, which I use the next day, but many coffee connoisseurs would be horrified by that. I don't know if it really matters, because the area that holds the beans doesn't have a great seal anyhow. For that reason, I try to leave as many beans as possible in a separate airtight container, and I wait to pour the beans into this grinder until right before grinding. That requires guessing the amount of beans.\n\nMess:\nEvery time I grind beans, I have a mess to clean up on the counter, and the collection container also gets little blocks of finely ground coffee stuck on the top and sides. This isn't so bad when I'm making a finer grind to use in a drip machine, because I can scrape it into the container and use it for brewing, but when I'm grinding a coarse grind for the french press, those finely ground blocks stuck to the side of the collection container get thrown out. Over time that adds up to a lot of coffee being wasted.\n\nThe grinder itself also gets this finely ground coffee stuck in the hole that connects to the collection container, so once in a while that needs to be cleaned out, or the grinder will stop working.\n\nLastly, I wish the coarse setting went a little bit bigger. It works for a french press, but it's not as coarse as other grinders I've tried."

I find myself grinding beans for coffee and it's frequently not enough ground coffee for my desired strength. Aside from that, it's very handy. If you're using flavored beans you'll have to clean it after each use to avoid contamination. It's easy to drop when you're emptying the beans back into a bag from the hopper and machine. It's best to measure your beans carefully and grind until they're all gone, rather than rely on what the manufacturer deems to be the right amoung for your brew."

Every time I have to move grinds from one container (the nutribullet container, to filter or to jar to store grinds) it was just making a mess.\n\nI can truly say this is much messier than the nutribullet. The container that hold the grinds is a box with a lid. Ground bean dust is everywhere. It is much messier than I expected. However, the reason I am keeping this is now I have more control over how fine I grind my beans.\n\nThe cup size selection doesn't work for me. I must use much more coffee than expected per cup because I need to set mine to 12 cups just to grind enough for 8 cups of coffee. If I use the 8 cup setting, it is entirely too weak and pale when brewed.\n\nI will keep this product and try to figure out how to reduce the mess."

And as Anakin Skywalker says, it's irritating and it gets everywhere. This renders it useless for grinding beans for cold brew or French press, which require a coarse grind. With a commercial grinder, there's very little dust, and most of that is heavy enough to settle to the bottom of the container. On the coarsest setting, the Cuisinart produced dust that's so light and fine that it stays suspended after 24 hours and then passes straight through two layers of filter paper without leaving residue."

I am actually purchasing my 4th Cuisinart grinder today because I really like the way it grinds coffee, the convenient large coffee bean hopper on top that holds plenty of beans, and lastly the large reservoir for holding the ground coffee. Some of the other coffee grinders I have used have very small grind capacity and you have to grind a couple times to fix a large pot of coffee. I use a French Press, Ninja-Coffee Bar System, and a De'Longhi EC155 15 BAR Pump Espresso and Cappuccino Maker\nfor fixing coffee and this grinder does a great job of grinding the coarse grind for my French Press, a little finer grind for my Ninja-Coffee system and extremely fine for my Espresso maker.\n\nThe ONLY reason I did not give this grinder 5 stars is because they don't last very long before wearing out. I fix coffee daily and I only get about 2 years out of one of these grinders. Because of the great job they do grinding coffee and their reasonable price I always come back to this grinder. As previously stated, if these grinders lasted longer it would have been a 5 star review. Do yourself a favor and purchase on of these grinders, you won't be sorry!"

When I grind flavored beans, the fines are sticky, and start to clog the grinder. But I can take a toothpick and loosen them out of the chute where the coffee comes out, and this is where most of the problem is. When I'm done grinding the flavored beans, I can take apart the grinder easily, and loosen up any other clumps of fines easily enough. I have to use a tool to do it, but I can reach everywhere I need to.\nThis does hold most of a pre-roast pound of coffee (maybe 5/6 a pound post roast?)\nWhen it grinds coffee, even plain beans, it does produce fines. These collect and stick near the top of the collection container, and and they can be pulled out easily enough before dumping out the normal ground beans.\nThe first grinder I had like this seemed to have one setting. I'm not 100% sure I had the funnel on far enough, because the second grinder I got is just fine, and adjusts to different coarseness well.\nI said \"second grinder\". Yes, my first grinder shelled out. You have to baby those flavored bean grinds more than I was, or you will burn out your grinder. Only grind one set, then clean, and so on. Flavored beans are much harder on the machine.\nThe collection container works well, fits together easily, inserts easily."

I bought this exclusively to coarse grind coffee for a french press. Unfortunately it doesn\u2019t do a very good job of it. On the coarsest setting it produces a huge amount of tiny particles along with the desired coarse ones. The result is a lot of sludge in the bottom of a cup of coffee from the french press. I found as a workaround, that I could put the grounds in a glass jar and shake it causing the larger bits to rise to the top. Then the coffee could be scooped out and used in the french press, while the smaller particles that had settled could be saved and used in a drip machine. Certainly not an ideal solution.\n\nA second issue is the plastic cup which receives the grounds. The grinding produces a large amount of static electricity causing the powdery pieces to stick all over the cup, inside and out. I found it virtually impossible to pour the grounds into anything smaller than a large funnel without making a big mess. After emptying the cup, so much powder remained stuck to it that it had to be washed after every use.\n\nLike most Cusiinart products, the build quality is excellent and it would be a great value if one finds the grind quality acceptable. For french press use I did not and chose to return it. I\u2019ve ordered an Oxo unit that reportedly produces far less powder and has a stainless steel cup, but does cost nearly three times as much."

It's also a little better in terms of the general coffee grinding mess that ends up on the kitchen counter. Most of this happens while transferring the grinds into the coffee maker, and it's just part of using a grinder.\n\nIt took some trial-and-error to figure out my grind size and cup number settings, but not much. To make 7 cups as measured by my Cuisinart drip coffee maker, I have settled on medium grind and 10 cups for a full-bodied brew. This grinder is BIG but has a quality look on the counter. It holds a lot of beans and is very easy to refill.\n\nCoffee grinds tend to stick inside the catch container on the side that is hit by the ejecting grinds, but this was no surprise. Cuisinart provides a tiny brush for this purpose, but I'm shopping for a better one. If this unit lasts a few years, I'll be very happy."

Bad Customer Service - If you have unfortunate need to call their Customer Service Center, you may wait 20 minutes to finally talk to someone.

I have only used it on medium grind (for my drip-filter coffee maker), so cannot speak to either fine (for espresso) or coarse (for French press) settings. But there seems to be a wide range of settings available. The length of automated grind time is determined by the slide setting for \"number of cups\", and each user will have to determine what setting produces the amount of ground coffee desired; another way of saying this is that the indicated size of the \"cups\" may or may not be commensurate with the individual user's idea of cup size and may require a larger or smaller slide setting for a given number of cups of coffee for desired strength and for a particular bean source. Even though it is a disc-burr and not a cone-burr machine, the coffee grinds appear to be sufficiently uniform and better than a blade grinder machine. I like that both the bean reservoir and grinds reservoir are dishwasher-safe. My sense is that for my fairly ordinary purposes, I could have spent 2-3 times as much for a coffee grinder and not been any happier."

Even though it has multiple settings, it seems that every 3 or 4 notches is really where you notice the difference.\n\nAlso, not all the beans are ground that are put in the holder. I believe this relies heavily on weight/gravity in order to grind the beans. So once you have a small amount of beans in the grinder left, they just jump around while trying to grind. This is problematic if you decide to grind a different bean later as you'll have to remove the unground beans from the container unless you want them blended with your new grind.\n\nIt's not a bad investment if you grind for a variety of coffee makers, but if you use a standard coffee maker, there may be better grinding solutions for you."

That's probably the reason why most people are on this page in the first place.\nThere is one slightly negative feature about the DBM-8, though: it's LOUD! There's no way to ignore the fact that it's one ear-shattering machine... as loud as any very loud, hand-held power tools I have. Except when using those, I wear some type of ear protection.

            "reviewText": "Prior to me ordering this Cuisinart grinder, I ground my coffee with a manual burr grinder (Camano Coffee Mill). I had total control over the grind from coarse to fine. The Cuisinart is different; While a burr grinder, it's a cross between a frappe blender and a leaf blower. A pulsed blade grinder will provide somewhat of a consistent grind. This Cuisinart grinder however, is loud, and makes a fine, or at best almost-medium grind with a lot of powder. And attempting to set beyond a preset coarse grind prevents the unit from turning on.\n\nTo the Cuisinart engineers who designed this, slow down the motor by a factor of 50, and have the ground coffee fall into a container below - you don't need to forcefully blow coffee out the front into a canister. Until then, I'm back to using the manual Camano grinder."

For those emergencies I've relied on a small Hamilton blade grinder, but I've never gotten the results I wanted.\n\nHowever, the Cuisinart is exactly what I have been missing! A world of difference. I can now get the same results as the commercial Bunn grinder at my coffee store.\n\nThe Cuisinart conveniently holds a half pound of coffee beans in its hopper, ready to grind as much coffee as needed. The ground beans are automatically forced into a small rectangular plastic container. You simply pull out the container, take its lid off, and scoop out the amount of ground coffee needed. So easy and convenient.\n\nI recommend this coffee grinder."

I feel like it does grind to much for the setting I put it on sometimes. Probably my biggest problem with this is the static electricity that happens when it\u2019s done grinding. It makes the grinds cling to the sides of the container and if your not careful it explode out of it when you open it. My solution is to cover the back opening with my hand and tap the container against the counter a few times to knock the grinds down into the container. Works like a charm. Also the coarse setting works perfect for cold brew!!! I haven\u2019t tried the fine setting. Overall I love this and it\u2019s a massive upgrade from those 1 pot grinders."

Overall I like the top hopper and the cup quantity selector. If you choose 8 cups it grind that amount of beans. I\u2019ve been happy with that but some people might like more manual control of the bean quantities. The top bean hopper lends itself to making more grinding noise- it\u2019s a good alarm clock for the rest of the House! Also you should understand that the hopper makes you pour in one blend- so if you want to use this for a decaf pot and it\u2019s got regular in it, you have to pour out the beans in the hopper to put in the decaf beans. So, this may be a limit for you. But it\u2019s a really good grinder and I\u2019d buy it again, hoping it\u2019s more durable than the Bellemain I had, it grinds more consistently for sure, better than my Krups too."

We buy a specialty coffee that is a bit on the oily side and it will clog this grinder up once a week. This machine has a slide switch, which basically tells the grinder how long to run. There is no fine control for it. It either runs too long or not long enough. The longer we have this machine the more we hate it."

It\u2019s settings allow for grinds compatible with just about any coffee brewing device I\u2019m aware of.\n\nI use it to prepare coffee for my French press and my cold brew carafe.

However, the grinds shoot out very clumsily from the hop and they end up all over the table and under the chamber eventually (not ever sure how that happens!). The static from the plastic is really annoying to deal with and it decided to stop working today. I cleaned it out, and there was not a lot stuck under the burr or beside it. Now the only way it works is if I hold down the \"start\" button. I suspect there is a loose part inside as the start button is somewhat loose to begin with. I don't have time for this in the morning, and I doubt you do either. It doesn't help that I used this for my espresso machine (I thought it made a pretty decent texture). I am not sure how air tight this machine is, but it makes really fine particles, even if you don't want it to.\n\nIt's pretty loud, but that's to be suspected... About cleaning, as I said it shoots perpendicular into the chamber and the static that's created pushes the particles into the air."

The only downsides to this machine is that it is a little loud, and the cup measurements. The cup dial may grind far less than you need if you like strong coffee. For example, I typically use approximately 2 tablespoons or about 10g of coffee per cup, and I usually make about 4 cups. If I were to set the grinder on the 4 cup setting, it may grind about 13 to 17g of coffee. So you have to know about how much each setting will grind, or just weigh out your amount of coffee, and just dump in that amount and grind it all, which is what I do. Minor inconveniences that I overlook for this great lower priced burr grinder!"

On this lovely, autumn, rainy Pacific Northwest morning, the only thing that got me out of bed was the thought of my ritual slow morning coffee routine.\n\nSo, having my coffee grinder slowly grind to a stop without producing any ground coffee was like waking up to a cold bucket of water thrown in my face.\n\nI did what little diagnostics I could, thumping the thing around, checking to make sure it was plugged in, making sure the hopper was shoved in as far as it could go with top tightly in place. Nothing. Not a whimper.\n\nDisgusted, I threw the she-devil into the trash and stomped on over here to check out replacement coffee grinders. Of course, my mind was mostly on how I was going to get through the day without my pleasant morning of coffee, classical music, and the news. Yes. I am \u201cthat\u201d kind of nerd. And tea just doesn\u2019t cut it. Tea and pop music is for unwinding in the afternoon. Angry rap is for house cleaning, in case you needed to know. (The more swear words the better.)\n\nBut back to Amazon and coffee grinders. As always, I read reviews. People love this product or hate it. I loved mine until I hated it, so I was willing to give it a second look.\n\nAh ha! Lightbulb moment. One of the reviewers said the product required a periodic breakdown cleaning. I have no idea how to do that, so I proceeded. I pulled the beast out of my trash, turned it upside down and whacked it on the counter a couple times. Coffee began to snow, slowly and stubbornly, but enough to make a nice drift on my counter top.\n\nI turned it on its side and noticed the little square the coffee comes out of was almost completely choked with fine grain powder. I used a steak knife and cleared that all out. I then used the steak knife to clean between the grinders, which was actually very easy.\n\nAll in all, I rescued about a quarter cup of trapped, finely ground coffee. Skeptical, I plugged the delicious beast back in, filled it with beans, installed the hopper and, guess what? Coffee in hand, music softly playing, fireplace glowing, rain pattering against my windows.\n\nToday is a good day after all."

No matter how you set it, the size distribution of the grind is very broad, and includes a substantial fraction of powder, which makes for very nasty dirty-tasting coffee, and makes cleaning the collecting chamber, where the dust gets stuck in the corners, very difficult. It's also ridiculously loud. All grinders are loud, but this seems at least twice as loud as the old Capresso I have at home. Don't buy it."

Subsequent grinds were far more in line with what I expected and the flavor was actually excellent using a bean we'd used day in and day out for years (earning it the 2nd star). The grind does make a difference. Then on our 7th or 8th pot when I went to pull the grinds out and the top was full but nothing was in the grind cup. I dumped the grinds, made sure nothing looked jammed, and tried again but it wouldn't turn on. I went to the old grinder, made the pot, and figured I'd try again the next morning. Next morning same thing, turned on, heard grinding noises but no grinds. Packed it up and shipped it back.\n\nDecided not to get a replacement because for as good as the coffee was it was a mess to get it from the container into the filter. With my 12 year old Braun grinder it dumps right in with the excess coming out with a simple tap on the lid. With this? I'm cleaning counter tops and still can't get everything out of the inside. It shows using a brush and yes, that helps, but now the brush is full of grinds and, well, it's not THAT much better flavor."

Recently it was starting to grind poorly and inconsistently, then finally stopped working unless I pushed down on the hopper. I took it apart and determined was a bad winding on the motor. That allowed me to look at the burrs. I was a bit disappointed to see that they were extremely worn, meaning they are not hardened. Also, the adjustment threads are plastic and were cracked. Definitely time to replace this grinder. I decided to purchase the same one since it does offer descent performance for the relatively low $45. I'll just replace it again in 4-5 years, saving my Rancilio Rocky grinder for grinding espresso alone."

Since I only drink dripulator coffee I reasoned that any burr grinder, even the cheapest would be A. Better than a blade and B. sufficient for dripulator coffee. The Black & Decker required that the coffee be measured into the unit, and that the button be depressed during the entire operation.\n\nI decided to buy the Cuisinart grinder because the price seemed competitive and also because my Cuisinart coffee maker continues to perform well and is now 3 years, 8 months old. The moment I opened the new Cuisinart I saw that it was much more of a machine than what I had been using. I always drink the same amount of coffee every day, and the ability to push \u201cstart\u201d and forget it is so much better than going through the entire procedure of measuring in the beans every morning and holding the button while it\u2019s grinding.\n\nThe grind itself, while not perfect in the way a 200.00 grinder would be, has far greater consistency than what I\u2019ve been used to, and the taste during the last four days has been smoother than anything ever obtained, even once, with the other grinder.

The only bad thing I noticed is that the grinds tend to stick electrostatically to the grind cup (maybe because of our super dry air this time of year). Been a few weeks and this still works great, but I have taken the bean cone off and cleaned down by the mill wheel as preventive maintenance.

Thus, I won't be buying another one as I've seen some paying upto close of the price of a new one just for shipping and handling as Cuisinart requires you to do so even under warranty. I wouldn't recommend this grinder unless you are going to use it very sparingly or only upto maybe 8 months to a year."

I had tried so many grinders of all makes and prices that I had given up hope, until this one. It became sluggish a few weeks ago with the coffee beans not wanting to drop down into the blades and so I removed the few parts that I could and cleaned it thoroughly. A job well worth doing, as now it works like new. Last year I purchased another one exactly the same to have as a reserve, but so far, fingers crossed, I have not needed it and it does get a lot of use, almost every day. For the price I think this is an excellent machine and would highly recommend."

Being a burr grinder it's way more accurate than any blade grinder and if you only plan on doing pour overs or drip coffee this is definitely good for that. if you want to make espresso you will definitely need a more expensive grinder. Everything feels pretty sturdy but there's a lot of plastic which is expected at this price. it looks pretty good so no complaints there. with all that being said there is definitely some things that i don't like about it. first of all by far the worst part of this grinder is how loud it is. its insanely loud, and not only that but it's a fairly unpleasant sound. I'm also not a huge fan of the timer, i wish you could just press a button to turn it on then press it again to turn it off. overall if you're only making pour over or drip coffee and can get over the noise it's a pretty good grinder, especially for this price."

Its Fine settings will deliver espresso grinds for use in pressurized filter systems. It works perfectly with my DeLonghi EC155M. However, it will not grind finely enough for use in non-pressurized filters.\n\nIf you're a fan of oily, dark coffee beans, be sure to keep this grinder clean to avoid problems.

I've always used a metal blade grinder for making my espresso in my cheap Mr. Coffee espresso maker, and I was consistently getting very bitter cups of espresso. That's when the researching began. After reading that what type of bean grinder you use makes a huge difference, I decided to buy what I could afford. To be honest I was very skeptical at first, and even held off on buying a burr grinder. I should have never of delayed. Even with a cheaper burr grinder, the difference in taste is more than drastic. I think my taste buds had gotten used to burnt and bitter espresso. In all honesty, I was not getting the results I wanted from my Mr. Coffee espresso machine, so I bought a coffee maker, and got rid of the 'espresso' machine. My coffee was coming out extremely sour at first, but I turned the dial on the burr grinder to a finer grind, still on medium, but a notch more to the left, and I was able to get a really good cup of coffee. I hope to one day be able to afford a real espresso machine, but until then, I can live with coffee, and with this burr grinder. I encourage anyone debating to buy a burr grinder to do so, there is a huge difference in taste. This device is also very easy to use, and to clean. There's a good YouTube video out there on how to clean it as well. You do need to take it apart from time to time, and brush out the dust with a toothbrush, or some sort of brush. You can also run rice through it, grind it like you would the beans so the rice catches the coffee bean oil and cleans it out. I heard if you don't clean it out from time to time your machine can stop running, due to it being clogged with coffee bean dust."

            "reviewText": "My husband and I refer to the bell signifying our coffee's dripped and ready as \"Call of the Wild,\" which should cue you into how important it is for us to get it right without going crazy and spending a million bucks.\n\nThat said, we hoped to get a more satisfying cup of joe with stout full-bodied flavor with Cuisinart's burr mill. But it has been a big disappointment.\n\nFirst, it was very difficult trying to get the two adjustments for an optimal grind to work together, having to fiddle repeatedly with the 18 different grind size choices at the same time as picking the number of cups we wanted ground fresh. (It's geared to grind exactly how much you've selected by pressing \"start\" without having to hold the bar down.) Too fine grounds make for a bitter cup and too large ones don't deliver the flavor. Only now do we appreciate how well our coffee company has perfected this process, which explains why the coffee we usually buy is STILL better preground than the same brand/type beans we've been trying to grind ourselves fresh with this grinder.\n\nThat's because even when you think you've got your grind setting right, it's impossible to fine-tune the number of cup measures if you're not making a pot for a crowd because the choices are limited to 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18. It's like Cuisinart figured everybody wanting a mug or two of great coffee have defected to the \"la-la\" pod makers, which is just the opposite direction of where coffee connoisseurs ever head. If you want to make a single large mug, the \"4\" setting grinds too much (we would have wanted a \"3\"). For two mugs, we would have wanted a \"5,\" but that's not an available choice either. In any case, you are left grinding more beans than you want and either making more coffee than you planned (big waste of money!) or going back to remeasuring and making a mess. And it's a mess because the grounds do not pour out well from the small rectangular bin whether you try to tap them out from the opening in the back or take off the clumsily-fitting top lid. The grounds all just want to dump out in a big lump, but because the bin's plastic and there's no shoot or spout, and grounds static-cling to its sides, too. The bin is also difficult to slide back into the mill, taking multiple jiggling tries--like a bad door key.\n\nThe only pluses are that you can store beans in the top hopper, having to fill it only every couple of days, and that the grinding noise is less than expected, letting you use the machine even before your partner's up as long as you have at least one closed door between the two of you. BIGGEST DISADVANTAGE: the results will cause enumerable fights between frustrated couples!!!\n\nIt's too bad Cuisinart didn't do its homework because it could have made this a sensational product for little more investment. It needs to 1) increase the setting choices for amount of coffee ground cup by cup starting at 2 so that those not making a full pot--most people--can use it (i.e., 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...) and 2) redesign the cheap bin with a usable pour spout or shoot in glass, not plastic. I would have willingly paid $5-10 for these features...and been happy."

The only think I don't like is the lower container, which has a flat -lift off lid just like my old Krups one did. I would really like a solid lid that you could snap on & off without worrying about dropping it. Static is still a problem, but I didn't want to spend double the dollars to get a grinder with a glass grounds container.

Second, the large, rectangular design means that it's next to impossible to dump the grinds into a coffee filter without them scattering everywhere. It looks good, but I recommend you get something else with a smaller, glass receptacle instead."

I also didn't want to pay an arm and a leg for a grinder. Although this grinder is bigger than our small blade grinder, it still fits under the counter and its footprint doesn't take up too much real estate. I feel the setting make the course grind too course, even for french press, so we moved it to a medium setting. I like the reservoir both for beans and grounds. You can make up to 18 cups of ground coffee should you need! We've been happy with the purchase."

While it's a nice looking appliance the grinding performance leaves quite a bit to be desired. Biggest issue is that regardless of what grind setting you are using 5-10% of the grinds are just super fine powder, makes it a pain to have to clean out this dust. There's a lot of static in the bin too so grinds are always left in the bin and needs to be cleaned more often than necessary. Irritatingly noisy too, more of a high pitched whirring sound like a blade grinder and not as quiet as a true conical burr.\n\nA good buy for a decent drip coffee but for pour overs or espresso or any other more precise coffee's you should look elsewhere."

Cons: takes a bit of trial and error to get the grind right, but once you get the amount of beans, # of cups and grind set you're golden... the other problem is that it is messier than expected.

From what I have read this is a common problem with the Capresso over time. After reading many reviews on different models of coffee grinders I settled on this one for the price and look. It does a nice job grinding the beans and I like the settings for different levels of courseness or fineness. HOWEVER, it is very loud, much louder than the Capresso. Many other reviewers reported this same experience and it's the one downside of this grinder. Luckily, we live in a large enough house where the bedroom is far from the kitchen but you cannot even talk over the grinder it is so loud. Just like the Capresso, this receptacle for the coffee grounds gets static which causes a mess with the grounds.

The uniformity of the end product is excellent (except for the powdery by-product which I will get to later).This is the second Cuisinart grinder I have owned. The first was basically an older generation of the same model, and it lasted more than 12 years. This newer model is not \"quiet\" by any means, but it is noticeably quieter than the older model, and its ability to grind coffee at the coarse setting (for French press) is considerably better. In my opinion, the feature which allows you to set a number of cups to grind is useless. I never use it, as I prefer to measure by coffee scoop rather than trust the grinder to do it, and I doubt that it could be very accurate or repeatable given that I am sure the setting is based on time and not volume--in other words, setting it to \"12 cups\" will simply cause the grinder to grind for a longer time before auto-stopping than setting it to \"4 cups.\"\n\nThe major drawback of this grinder is that, no matter how coarse the grind setting, it always produces a certain amount of fine powder in the final product. When grinding enough coffee for a full pot (10-12 cups) this powder collects just beneath one corner of the container holding the ground coffee and is at least one to two teaspoons. If you do not carefully try to capture and discard this powder, it will mix in with the coffee you have just ground. In the case of drip/filtered coffee it's not the end of the world, but it is awful for French press coffee since it winds up as unpleasant murky grit in the final product, and a layer of sludge at the bottom of your cup."

This meant I had to empty the coffee ground already as well as the still whole beans from the device, take the coffee holders off and then unclog the device. This happens nearly every time I use it. Now all other aspects of the device seem to be ok however, when grinding one pound of very normal coffee beans causes the thing to jam, one has to wonder.\n\nIn my opinion this device is not any better than an comparably priced Mr. Coffee or Hamilton Beach product and those sometimes are the subject of sale prices."

The hopper and catcher are also staticky and grinds stick to the catcher, which means you never get them all out and have to clean it constantly. The grinder also produces really small grinds that stick to the top of the catcher regardless of what grind size you choose. Since I use a french press and chemex, this is not ideal at all. I would suggest saving up and buying a better grinder. It's not worth wasting the $40. I submitted for support from Amazon and the manufacturer and did not receive a response from either."

The most irritating thing is that when it grinds the coffee, it gives it a static charge to the finer grounds which then stick the walls of the receptacle and fly around when you try to scoop them out. Always makes a mess when using. I would not buy this again."

I have it set to the 3rd coarsest setting and still see coffee grinds the consistency of confectionary sugar. The ultra fine particles, coupled with having to remove the cover of the grind capture container result in coffee dust ending up all over the kitchen counter. I purchased this specifically due to the burr grinder and the purported consistent grind size that yields a better cup of coffee but this unit is no better than a cheap blade grinder.

There is no easy way to take the ground coffee and put it in anything without it making a huge mess. There's a weird lid that you need to take off to get the coffee out and it goes everywhere when you do.\n\n2. It just doesn't seem to work very efficiently. Compared with my old grinder and some that my friends have it just seems to spin its wheels while it's trying to grind. I bought it so I could make large amounts for cold brew but grinding a couple cups seems to take 10 minutes.

Consistent grind, though I mostly used a medium grind.\n\nCons: Loud. Messy; when you grind, the unit builds up static electricity which causes a small amount of the grounds to \"jump\" out of the grind container when you open it. You will spend some time cleaning up every day you use this. It's not small; unless you have some big cupboards and want to haul it out every time you use it, this will live on your counter."

You select how many cups you want to brew for and hope that you get more or less what you want. I am using this for pour over brewing, so I need more precise control. Putting only the amount of beans you want to grind into the canister doesn't work because the beans end up hopping around inside the canister and do not get ground. 3) I get about a tsp of finely ground coffee near the mouth opening of the grounds container, even though my setting is medium/coarse. I just scoop it out and toss it, but not sure why this is occurring. All in all, for the price - its okay."

            "reviewText": "As a budding coffee enthusiast, I looked long and hard at the grinders here and different information regarding blade versus burr grinders. Apparently, burr grinders produce less heat (preserves the taste) and make more consistent grinds than a blade grinder and so the former is preferable to the latter. With that, I also found that the blade grinders weren't that much cheaper than a burr grinder like this one so I opted for this product.\n\nI must say that I am VERY pleased with my purchase. Like others have said, if you are expecting this thing to never make any powder, or to make perfectly super finely ground coffee, you're hoping too much for it. For my purposes, I don't want my coffee ground that finely anyway---I drink coffee from a french press, so it's supposed to be more coarsely ground. I really like how you can set how much coffee you want, hit the Start button, and it will stop on its own. From what I understand, for the blade grinders you have to sit around and push the button until you get the consistency you want.\n\nYes, this guy makes noise---but would you think that something that is pulverizing coffee beans into smaller grains is going to be a silent affair? I actually am amused by the noise it makes and enjoy watching the beans falling down and coffee being shot into the grind chamber. Besides, unless you're constantly grinding coffee, the noise lasts for at most about a minute, less if you don't grind that much at a time (I only set it between about the \"8-12 cup\" range on the machine)\n\nStrangely, I don't have that much of an issue with static with the plastic grind chamber, which is a complaint I've read more frequently here in the reviews. Yet, I live in an area that has very dry air, hence I would think it would be a bigger problem. When I take the grind chamber out, I just give it a couple light taps (to get the grinds to settle a bit), pull it out, and dump the coffee into its personal airtight container. I then just flick the powdery leftover from the chamber body and lid into the sink and wash them. I'm not sure what's going on with other owners in having the \"static cling\" problem.\n\nI think this grinder is a perfect start-up machine for anyone getting into grinding their own coffee. If you're using it to make coffee for a french press, through a drip coffee maker (in other words, nothing that needs super consistent, super fine grinds), I think this will do it for you. If a buyer does not have unrealistic expectations of what this machine can do, I think he or she will be very satisfied with the purchase.\n\nUPDATE: January 2011\n\nI just wanted to throw out there that this guy is still trucking along just fine. And I still don't have a static problem either, even though I live in the desert, and it's dry as all get-out here. Unless you're a true coffee connoisseur / coffee snob, this grinder will definitely be more than enough for most everyday needs. I actually stop and watch the beans go down and listen to them get ground up....so the noise issue that people complain about isn't an issue for me. Combine this guy with a french press and you've got absolutely divine coffee.\n\nUPDATE: March 2012\n\nThis is *still* chugging along great! So I'm not sure what may have happened with anyone who suffered a durability issue; might have been just the individual product. Still producing great grinds for great coffee =) Noisy enough to scare my cats but a non-issue for the 30 seconds or so it's working at a time for me."

I think the coffee is ground better and I actually can taste the difference compared to my old braun grinder where I kept pushing down on the lid until I guessed about when to stop. I like to make french press as well as drip and the grinds for those should be different. The only drawback as I can tell is if you don't use a brush to remove the grind from the container, you end up with bits of coffee all over. In the old grinder, I just tapped the grind into the brewing basket. I think I can get used to that for better tasting coffee."

We make both drip and French press coffee.\nOur first grinder lasted 3 years and then needed replacing. Unfortunately the container that holds the grounds completely broke last week. I had saved the one from our old machine so thought we had been saved. Not so, I went to use the ground coffee this morning and noticed a piece of plastic in the coffee grounds. Ordered a replacement container since our grinder is less than a year old. It will take about 8 days to get here! I\u2019m not a happy camper. Had I purchased a new grinder, it would have arrived tomorrow. By the way, the lid is not included with the replacement."

Regardless of grind setting, it always leaves an amount of very fine powder in the grind. This clumps up at the front of the container and can be scooped out - which is necessary if you happen to be making cold press and filtering it with a #4 cone (I didn't realize this the first time I used the grinder and that batch took hours to filter when it usually takes about 20 minutes). Fine for the price, but I'll consider upgrading to something more consistent in the future."

            "reviewText": "I love the way it grinds the coffee. I like my coffee finely ground. So in terms of taste and grinding performance, it's great.\nBut it makes such a huge mess every time i use it! The finely ground coffee seems to create static electricity, so when I uncover the box with the coffee after it is ground, coffee flies everywhere. I have tried everything i can think of to avoid this and cannot find a suitable solution. Because of the big mess, I've started grinding my coffee weekly rather than daily--which somewhat defeats the purpose of having a home grinder.\n\nMy other minor complaint is that there does not appear to be any convenient way to empty the hopper on top. For instance, let's say i fill it with caffeinated coffee and grind it, and there's some leftover on the top. Then i want to grind decaf. i have to tip over the machine and turn it upside down to get the caffeinated beans out so i can grind the decaf.\n\nbottom line--i find the coffee great for use, evenly ground, etc. The mess this makes is a nuisance.\n\nThis is an addendum: The grinder stopped working completely on its 10th use or so. I wrote the manufacturer and they sent me another--but I'm afraid to use it! Lots of reports online about the thing clogging up with coffee and then stopping entirely. I cleaned and cleaned it but could not get it to start again. Completely dead. buyer beware."

First, it has 18 grind settings but the difference from one setting to the next is basically imperceptible so there's a lot of trial and error. It could easily be pared down to 1/2 that many settings, maybe even a 1/3. That's more a comment than a complaint however. The biggest con of this unit is the plastic hopper (wish I had taken other reviewers comments more seriously) and the static cling. It is a royal PITA. Good coffee beans are not cheap and the waste and the mess from this hopper is unacceptable. You can't pour the ground coffee from the hopper directly into a filter basket as it makes a mess. I have to put it into a another (glass) container and even that makes a mess. Sorry Cuisinart, Reduce the number of settings, use a glass receptacle, and you'll have a really good product rather than an OK one."

I usually grind only enough for a single serving of coffee and there is substantially more dust and small particles than the $27 handheld conical burr grinder. I haven't done a side by side test but the consistency seems to be barely a cut above a blade grinder. The other issue is that this grinder is fairly loud. The loudness wouldn't be too bad if it wasn't such a high frequency but as it is, it is not very pleasant to turn on.\n\nOverall, for the $39 I paid it is a decent product and decent value. It looks nice, has a large capacity hopper, and is much faster than a hand held grinder."

It\u2019s is too loud to use as a daily grinder, and well, any time grinder. I essentially have to do all my beans at once to avoid the frequent assault to my ears. This grinderdoes not grind small amounts well. Once the hopper is 1/4 full or less the beans do not stay in the grinding area because of the blade. It takes a substantial amount of time to grind them. I would either pick another more expensive burr grinder, or just settle for a blade grinder."

I use a cone filter, and have started sitting it the sink to hold it upright. Then I rinse the rest of the mess down the drain.

I should've known what I was getting at that price for a burr grinder. First of all this is a disk burr grinder NOT a conical burr grinder, if you really care about your coffee a conical burr grinder will give you a much better grind. But back to this grinder, there are different courseness settings but they don't actually change the grind all that much. This grinder also doesn't grind fine enough for espresso, and the course setting is not consistent enough for French press, you will have lots of fine grinds in your coffee that don't get pressed out. This grinder will work fine for people who use autodrip machines with paper filters, there will be some fine grounds that will make it through reusable filters. The plastic grounds chamber is not the best either, the grounds really like to stick to it's surfaces and you will need to wash it out and dry it after every use. This unit is easy to use, and easy to clean. It includes a cheap cleaning brush. The bean storage is not airtight, but at this price I didn't expect that.

It is definitely better than the old blade grinder I used, much more uniform grind and same grind every day. That being said, there are problems, some of which are also posted by other users.\n\nProblem No. 1 is that mine quit working in mid-grind after about 3 months. The company service department was very helpful, immediately sent me a new one on condition I would pay shipping for the new one and send the old one back. Then the same thing happened to the second one after three more months. Same exchange. I am now $50 more or less into shipping costs for the exchanges, more than I paid to start with. But the service is quick, at least.\n\nProblem No. 2 is that the three grinders were very different. I fill it every time using 64 grams of coffee for an 8-cup pot. The first grinder took about 60 sec. to grind that much, and was barely coarse enough for my Bonavita filter brewer even when I set the grinder to the coarsest setting. The second grinder had a better texture of grind but it took a ridiculously long time to grind one pot's worth of coffee--up to 2 1/2 minutes sometimes, very annoying considering how noisy the thing is. The third grinder is by far the best. I get the grind I want on the fourth from coarsest setting, and it zips through a 64 gram pot's worth of beans in 30 seconds.\n\nI am wondering, is there bad quality control, or are these things made in more than one factory, or what?\n\nI have read on line that sometimes the stopping problem isn't the motor going out but some switches that can be cleaned or bypassed. I think next time this third machine of mine stops working, I will take it apart and see if I can fix it rather than spend another $25 on postage and maybe get another one that doesn't grind as well as this one I have now.\n\nAs user after user has said, you get what you pay for."

Construction is solid, hopper capacity is fine, slider control feels a bit flimsy but I've basically left it in the same position since the first time I used it. Operation is fairly clean but static is not your friend here as the ground coffee sticks to the walls of the receptacle and the lid.

Every once in awhile it gets sorta plugged up and I have to take it apart (easy) and clear out a build up of packed grounds, but this only happens about 4 times a year and takes maybe 10 minutes. However, the current one, (our 1st original one) is having trouble starting up when the hopper is full. I assume this is a sign that the electric motor is beginning to weaken, If I play with it enough it will finally get going and grind 12 more cups of beans, and then might work great for several days and the have that problem again. So I purchased one as a back up so that when the original completely croaks, we will have a replacement on hand."

One month past 18 month warranty~~~ hmmm.\n\nWill do more research, but if I buy another, I'll definitely purchase extended warranty.\n\nBought after trying a hand cranked burr grinder. It was hardly any more money than that one anyway. Also, the manual grinder did not have a calibration for grind size either -- my real deal-breaker, since I use for both drip and cold drip. Sure love the ease of use! Kind of noisy. I was surprised however, how fine the coffee gets chopped. I have to use almost the coarsest setting for drip coffee, and the coarsest for cold drip. Someday I will try espresso, and I have no doubt it will grind finely enough.\n\nUse it every two days or so, and it matches nicely with my Cuisinart coffee maker. It is big! Read the measurements before you buy."

            "reviewText": "I Have had this grinder for about a year, and here is how I use it. First off, I primarily use my grinder on its finest setting as I use a Melitta cup top coffee hopper with #2 cone filters. Their cheap and make a good cup of coffee. Yes there is always dust that statically clings to the collection hopper due to the acrylic material. I simply fill my cone over the sink and wash the \"dust\" down the sink. Do I lose some coffee? sure I do. But it is a very small amount. Cleaning the chute is a breeze using a toothpick before I grind. I find that I have to do this about once a week. I just tilt the machine back slightly, clean the chute and slide the hopper back into place (while I still have it tilted back) to catch the residue and it makes no mess. I also find that no matter which setting I have it on, there is a certain amount of dust. On the occasions that I use it to make a pot of drip when we are having guests over; I set it on a medium grind and it does the trick perfectly. The coarser the grind, the lesser dust the machine makes. Again, you must consider the price point of this machine. I have yet to have any bogging problems that I have read about in some of the other reviews and I have never removed the bean hopper to clean it? All in all, I think this machine is hard to beat for the price point."

By the time I finish the last cup of coffee, there's so much sludge left that it feels like I'm drinking turkish coffee (exaggeration, but it's bad). I've heard that, even with the best manufacturers, you're not getting a great grinder for less than $100. This proves it. Maybe it's better for pour-overs or drip makers.\n- There aren't enough 'cup' settings. I end up with not enough grounds, or too many.\n\nSummary:\n- If you want to enter the world of grinding your own coffee, it's a good start if you only have $50. It's definitely good enough for me for now. But I'll definitely upgrade when I get an opportunity."

The lower edges of the grind cup chip off - but it doesn't affect the function at all\n2. Since it is plastic, the interior of the grind cup essentially has been sandblasted by the grinds shooting out - doesn't interfere with function (but the grinds do gather up on those areas)\n3. A little difficult to clean - you NEED to unscrew the hopper at least once a month and clean inside where the burrs are, but the interior area is hard to get to to really clean it well, I didn't realize my this needed to be done on my first one and it ended up breaking because of this after 2 years - but I bought another one because I loved it so much (and have given them as gifts).\n\nUpdate: 2017 - Still have the same grinder 7 years later and it's working like a champ! I clean it about once a month, more if the coffee is very is oily. But no issues!"

Some other reviews have pointed out that more coarse grinds for a French press brew don't come out well. I have not had a problem at all. So far every setting has worked well!\n\nThe only reason I am giving it 4 stars is it can be a bit messy to pour the fresh grind out of the 'catching bin.' I tend to use pretty fresh and oily beans so the grinder beans tend to stick to the side of the catching bin. When I tap the bin, fine coffee grind goes everywhere. That might a a little bit picky, but I thought it was worth to let you all know of.\n\nOverall, love this grinder! Super happy I have it and helps make the coffee brewing process better for me."

Then if you store that statically charged material in a non-conducting container, say, the plastic bin on the Cuisinart DBM-8 Supreme Grind Automatic Burr Mill, when you open said container, you'll get a flurry of tiny, statically-charged coffee particles flying everywhere and sticking to everything.\n\nPossibly if you live in a climate that's humid year-round and/or don't set the grinder to the finest setting, your kitchen won't be covered in clingy brown dust every time you make coffee. And possibly if the designers had made the bin out of metal instead of plastic, it would have reduced the static build-up (inside joke for electrical engineers: I need to ground my coffee).\n\nSo other than the mess it's awesome.

If it had a shape more like a pitcher that would funnel the ground beans into the receptacle without spillage, that would make it 5 stars. And yes, I know it comes with a scooper and brush thing, which can be used for some of the ground beans,but if you want to get it all out you'll still need to turn it upside down and make a mess. Maybe with a drip coffee filter it's fine, but why have a nice grinder for a basic drip coffee anyway? Much cheaper, smaller options exist if that's all you want."

Grinding slowed, then stopped. Opened the lid and smelled melted plastic.\n\nSo I called the CuisineArt customer service line. They warranty their products for 18 months--that's good, and they'll ship a new unit out right away, but the unfortunate customer will be liable for a $10.00 shipping and return shipping fee for a replacement. Also, the return box does won't have the return address on it (the rep had to give me that address). AND, if that wasn't enough, I was also given a 15 character \"service number\" to write on the outside of the box as well as on a piece of paper that was to be inserted inside the box, along with my check for $10.00. I guess I've been spoiled by Amazon's very friendly return process. CuisineArt's return process is very customer unfriendly and I get to pay $10.00 for the privilege? Nope. I'll look for another grinder from another company, and I'll keep this experience in mind when I shop for other CuisineArt products knowing this may be my misfortune again if another product dies under warranty. Thankfully, other options are available."

This coffee mill is perfect for drip coffee makers. There will be some static cling and some powered coffee to clean up periodically.\n\nThe lunatic fringe coffee people may be happier with a coffee mill that is a true burr coffee mill. This model has two rotating plates that does the coffee grinding. A true burr mill coffee grinder has two conical serrated metal rollers that grinds the coffee. These coffee mills can cost several hundred dollars but do turn out a more consistent uniform grind for the purists.\n\nFor the money, this coffee mill gets the job done for me.

            "reviewText": "First off, it took me quite some time to discover some information about this product:\n\n- That $90 list price is, of course, a fiction. If you go to [...], you'll find that it is offered for only about $10 more than on Amazon. Although manufacturers almost always sell to consumers at their list price, so as not to undercut their retail partners, in this case [...] actually is a retail outlet licensed to use the company's name.\n\n- Models CCM-16PCI and DBM-8 are actually the exact same item. Manufacturers often make different \"models\" for specific retailers in order to make price comparisons difficult. According to Cuisinart (the manufacturer), the serial number on my CCM-16-PCI shows that it was made for Sam's Club.\n\nNow, as to the product itself, I've been testing it with French-roast Jamaican Blue Mountain (an odd combination that I was given as a gift):\n\n- I would buy it again, because there doesn't seem to be a better choice in this price range. The\u00a0Burr Mill Adjustable/Pre-Programmed Coffee Grinder\u00a0is cheaper, but it got horrible reviews.\n\n- It works quickly.\n\n- Insofar as it is noisy, because the unit works quickly I don't find it a problem. I am not, however, the earliest riser in the family; so there is not really anyone to disturb. It is quieter than my previous burr grinder.\n\n- I wish the timer had a two-cup setting.\n\n- Nowhere does Cuisinart give their definition of a \"cup\". A standard measuring cup is 8oz. Until a few years ago, most automatic coffee makers defined a cup as 6oz. When the standard capacity of an automatic coffee maker was changed from 10 cups to 12 cups, the size of a cup magically became 5oz. (Do the math, and learn something about marketing.) When I make my coffee, I start with 16oz. of water; so the four-cup setting isn't too far off. I like strong coffee.\n\n- I found that the \"medium\" setting was perhaps a bit fine for use with my filter-and-cone brewing, but I'm still playing with it. I can't blame Cuisinart for that, as brewing techniques and preferences differ.\n\n- At two notches coarser than medium, a couple of large bean chunks made it through. How, I don't know.\n\n- I'll second all of the complaints about static electricity. The square corners on the receptacle make it difficult to get all of the coffee out without making a mess. My old Braun (no longer made) had rounded corners, so you could get closer with the scoop.\n\n- Because of the static electricity, wiping or brushing the receptacle is messy. It's a good thing coffee grounds aren't sticky.\n\n- The exit shoot on the grinder can't be brushed out with the receptacle in place, so anything that gets brushed out of there has no place to go except all over. Fortunately, I don't think much if anything accumulates in there."

It grids as finely as a grainy wheat flour, and that is fine enough for me. It doesn't grind it to an aerosol powder, but is great for cookies or breads.\n\nFor coffee, this would do a fantastic expresso grind, but will barely do it. It will not be the finest expresso, but it will get the job done. For a cone type filter, or regular drip coffee, this grinder would be a delight. It is very nice and is a bit of a luxury item for coffee grinding.\n\nFor my purpose of grinding my own grains for flour, it does really well and allows me to make healthy foods cheaply. This is far less expensive than an electric grain mill, and I don't have to worry about blades breaking off or dulling over time, since it is a burr grinder.\n\nAs far as value for the money, this is a steal of a deal. It is so nice, and about the cost of a good little blade grinder.\n\nI'm happy with this item. Hopefully it will last me a long time. I plan to use it a lot before the warranty expires to make sure."

We didn't buy it through Amazon, but my wife mentioned that we need a new grinder and I didn't hesitate to look up this model for our home, where I expect it to last decades. We do have to perform some maintenance on it from time to time with a Q-tip, a some keyboard cleaner compressed air.\n\nWe don't make espresso, but we do keep it on the finer setting for our Bunn-o-matic. I love that it takes the guess work out of measuring for new guys on the crew. Making coffee for the on-coming watch, they just have to know what number to set it on. Dixie cups with marker on the inside are a thing of the past. It's not too noisy, it's easy to clean, unobtrusive on the counter, and has yet to fall over in heavy seas."

I found this electric burr grinder and purchased it based on all the favorable reviews. It deserves every one of them. The grind is consistent and tastes great with my Chemex coffee maker(the best method in my humble opinion). My only issue with this device is the type of plastic that the collection receptacle is made from. It apparently holds a significant static charge and many of grounds stick over the entire surface area inside and out. Minor, I know, but still slightly annoying. Does anyone reading this silly review have a solution to this problem? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Enjoy!!!\n\nAddendum: Yes it is very loud. So if your up before the other members of your household you may as well grind enough for everyone because they are sure to be woken by the industrial machinery that is your new burr grinder."

Overall construction is solid, which is what I expect from Cuisinart, The hopper holds enough beans for about five 12-cup pots. The box which catches your grounds can be a little tricky to slide back into the unit, but once I got use to it, it's fine.\n\nSome advice for prospective buyers: as with any new grinder, it can be difficult finding the right grind and amount for your taste, so maybe I can save you some time by sharing my own experience. For a 12 cup drip machine with cone filter, my settings are as follows: the volume/amount setting is at 12, and the grind setting is at the 6th dot, going from left to right. This gives me a coffee of \"medium\" strength--flavorful without any bitterness. But if you like your brew with a little \"bite,\" go to the next finer setting. Also, some folks complain about dust-sized grind in the reservoir, which you definitely don't want because it will cause bitterness. My solution: this sticks in a clump to the top edge of the reservoir. I carefully remove the reservoir from the unit so I don't knock it loose, and then flick it into the garbage with my finger. Yeah, a bit of a pain, but for 40 bucks, I'm not complaining."

I thought I would save a few bucks over the Capresso but wasted another $9.52 in return shipping for my trouble instead. In case you are wondering, the hopper on the Capresso removes from the top and gives access to the grinding blade which pulls free so it can be brushed clean in a few strokes. Then, by tipping the unit, a few gentle taps to the body and a few brush strokes clears the grinds from the chamber into the catch bin. Quick, easy and efficient.

The \"cup\" setting is a timer that ranges from 4-12 cups but I tend to use a lot of beans and I found that it was leaving un-ground beans in the hopper when I was using the 4 cup setting so now I just set it to 6 cup and measure the beans my self, so it just ends up running 10 seconds or so after there are no beans left. I think this might be useful if you fill the hopper and wanted to just grind the right amount of beans for each pot of coffee but I store my beans in an air-tight container. I have a drip coffee maker so have only been playing with the \"medium\" grind settings so I can't speak to the grinders ability to make fine or corse grinds but there seems to be plenty of range to make anyone happy. As others have said, it does produce a bit of bean dust that sticks in the output container but no more than my old blade grinder and it there are no whole beans left over like with the blade grinder.\nTwo things that kind of caught me off guard with this grinder are it's size, it is about the size of a 12 cup coffee maker, and it is pretty loud, kind of sounding like a hair dryer. When I am making coffee during the day it does not seem loud but at 5am when the rest of the house is asleep it seems a lot louder.\nOverall I am very happy with this unit for the price. With my blade grinder I was always fighting for a consistent grind and often ended up with several untouched beans or too-fine coffee that ended up making strong but bitter coffee and even caused an over flow or two from the filter clogging.\nMax"

My only problem with this product is that it is not ideal for someone looking to make less than 4-6 cups of coffee at a time. The hopper on top is so large that if you put in less than 4 cups worth of beans, the beans will rattle around for 20-30 seconds at the end of the grind. This is annoying if you are making a small amount of coffee, as you probably measured your coffee and want those last beans. Also, if you put in more beans to force the beans in, they will go stale if not grinded in the first day. Along with that, since it is a burr, there is some production of coffee dust. This can throw off any precise measurements, since the catcher is larger enough that the dust clings to the walls, requiring some scraping if you want all the coffee. I also wish it had the option to continuously grind with the button pushed, as opposed to being limited to the cup settings. In conclusion, this is a great grinder if you plan to grind up a lot of coffee. If you are only making 1-3 cups at a time, stick to a smaller model or a hand cranked grinder."

I've used a Hario hand grinder and I don't have this problem, so I've concluding its specific to this machine.\n\nA lot of coffee guides will tell you to only load the hopper with as many beans as you're going to use. I don't recommend this for this grinder. If the beans aren't being weighed down by other beans, there's a good chance that the burrs will just spit them out and they'll bounce around the hopper. As a result, I usually buy a week's worth of beans from a local roaster and fill the hopper.\n\nFinally, this burr grinder will not give a consistent amount of ground coffee. I've had it barely fill the container, and sometimes I've had it fill too much.\n\nUltimately, this is an affordable burr grinder that will give you better, more consistent coffee than a blade grinder. That's why this gets three stars-the gulf between quality burr grinders and inexpensive burr grinders is pretty vast. But if you have money to spend on a burr grinder, get something else."

I use the grinder for a quick 4 tbsp. grind and make one 20 oz. French press batch that yields two cups of strong Joe. I've had better coffee. I prefer making a batch of cold process (Toddy) concentrate, but when I run low or plan badly, the French press works in a pinch. I use the coarsest setting for French press, and get some powder residue like the other reviewers. If you are very fussy about your coffee, skip over this grinder. If you are just looking for an alternative to blade grinders and you like the pleasant effect of grinding just as much as you need and keeping the whole beans handy, this is a decent grinder. That's all it is. I'd expect it to last a few years before it fails, it is not a commercial grade appliance. Good, not great.\nUpdate: I expected it to last a few years. It did not. After six months of light daily use, it died. I would not buy another."

Tip: grind the coffee, but leave the lid on. You can knock it against your brewer (mine is a french press) to get the coffee out without the static electricity causing it to fly everywhere.\n\nOne thing, I feel it may produce too many fines, even after a cleaning.

Some use a brush to clean the container (yes, a glass container would be preferred) and I suppose that would be just fine. I swipe it out with my finger (gasp) and put it in with the rest of the grinds to make a wonderful brew. The \"sludge\" at the bottom of my cup can be swirled in with my coffee or discarded by the mood that strikes me each morning. The differences in flavor I find in different beans is more of an issue to me.\n\nI am sure there are many coffee snobs who will read this and pass out from the sacrilege, but I find the flavor, on the worst of days, interesting. As to inconsistent grinds, I cannot understand how anyone could mistake this extremely inexpensive grinder for a MUCH MORE expensive one. If you need a snobbishly consistent grind, spend $200-400 and get what you want. I'll stick with this unit that consistently feeds my morning habit and occasionally treats my family and friends to a wonderful afternoon/evening brew of java."

The reason is that the metal burr heads are not given a close enough tolerance when set on the fine setting due to tolerances allowed during the manufacturing process. The setting can vary by .0015 or more making espresso grind too coarse. My first one of these was great. On fine grind it worked well for espresso. My new machine (the old one was lost during our move) doesn't have the same tolerance between the grinding teeth as the original. I guess it's what you can expect for the price. Again, not a bad machine for drip or French Press coffee."

It really looks good sitting on the counter."

            "reviewText": "I've used my new Cuisinart DBM-8 Burr Mill every day for the past month or so, brewing about 8 cups of fine-grind coffee per day. (It replaced a Mr. Coffee burr mill that worked well for about 4 years, until I ruined it by grinding almonds in it one day. No need to dwell here on my stupidity.)\n\nThe Cuisinart's grind seems very precise and uniform.\n\nThe automatic feature is convenient: You choose the number of cups you want, and it then measures out and grinds the beans at the touch of a button. The machine automatically stops grinding when it is done. (My now-departed Mr. Coffee lacked this feature. I had to measure and load the beans each day. Then I had to start and manually stop the grinder.)\n\nThe hopper holds about 8 oz. of beans. That's 4 to 5 days worth, set at 8 cups per day. I would prefer a larger hopper, holding a full pound of beans. But this is a minor complaint.\n\nThe black and stainless machine looks sharp on my kitchen counter. It disassembles for easy cleaning.\n\nI think the DBM-8 has good features and seems well constructed, considering the fairly low price. But, of course, having only used it for a month, I have no opinion yet on its durability. So far it has worked flawlessly. I am very pleased.\n\nUPDATE AS OF NOVEMBER 2012:\n----------------------------\nI now have used the DBM-8 for more than 1.5 years. It continues to work flawlessly."

A few hits from the air compressor cleared out the water and returned normal operating function.

I drink a lot of coffee so now I just couldn't live without it! I recommend it for anyone that grinds their own coffee!!!\n\nUPDATE: I absolutely loved this grinder until I went to grind coffee last week & it was as dead as Lincoln. This is a replacement for the first one I bought. The motor burned out on that one in no time. It will hold 1/2 pound of coffee beans. That's about all you can grind at one time. I always took it apart & cleaned it good after every 1/2 pound. Then I would wait a bit and grind some more, but never over 1 pound in a day. The motor will not take it.

That's the main reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5. Over the years it's worked great. The ability to adjust how fine it grinds is nice, though once we fiddled with it a bit and figured out our preferred level (medium) we never adjusted it again. There's usually some grounds build-up on the side of the canister, but I understand it's common with most all burr grinders, and it wasn't a huge problem.

But, based on my experience so far, this is a nice little machine for $45. It grinds perfectly for drip coffee on the Medium setting (I don't use Coarse or Fine, so cannot comment), and does so quickly. It is no louder than any other grinder. It is as clean an operation as you can expect from a coffee grinder, certainly much cleaner than when I was grinding small amounts in one of those little blade grinders. It is a nice looking appliance as well. My only criticisms: 1) the power cord is too short (about 18\"), and 2) in order to adjust the grind, you have to turn the entire hopper assembly. Fortunately, I don't have to because it comes set on Medium. But if you like your coffee any other way, the hopper will not be aligned with the base of the unit (hopper is square-shaped at the top, btw, not round). Cuisinart, if you are reading this, the grind adjuster band should turn independently."

It is far from perfect, but at this price I didn't expect perfection. I like the multiple setting for the grinder and that I can vary the amount ground at one time.

Only complaint is that the coffee grounds tend to stick around the inside wall of the container, and the square shape is difficult to pour from. I end up having to remove the lid and pour coffee grounds into my french press over the sink, because there's no way to prevent coffee grounds from flying over the edge and making a mess otherwise. I suppose you could scoop it out with a spoon instead of pouring it out, but that pretty much defeats the purpose of having perfectly measured user specified amounts of coffee coming out of the grinder."

I like that you choose your setting, push a button, and get a consistent grind each time. I give it three stars because of the shape of the container which receives the ground coffee. Given the light weight of the grounds and the squarish shape of the container, it very difficult to move coffee from grinder to coffee maker without making a little mess. The mouth of the container is wider than the basket in the coffee maker, so overspill is pretty easy. Since the two products are from the same company I expected a little more coordination of design."

Static is another issue I've run into. Granted, most of what sticks to the sides is powder but it's fairly frustrating to try to tap off the usable grinds while holding the lid on. Of course, you can use the brush every time too but that often makes it worse.\nThe fully automatic feature and multiple grind options are great and it is quieter than my blade grinder. It's easy to clean so far, with removable parts being safe in the dishwasher. The grinds are even and the coffee is better. I will be hard-pressed to go back to the blade even if I don't keep this one.\nConsidering the selection and quality of other burr grinders at this price range, I would purchase this one again despite the frustrations."

The grind is some what consistent overall but there is a small amount (about a teaspoon or two) of very very fine grindings that tends to stick to the side. Those fine grindings contribute to the coffee tasting bitter. The grinder has a function to grind a specific amount of beans. It's never been accurate.

If you are using this for espresso, drip, pour over, or something that does not require a course grind, I'd say you'd be fine.\nAdditionally, one of the screws one the underside of the hopper somehow came loose and ended up in the grinder...definitely not good. I removed the screw and everything is working fine without it, but it's clear that this isn't the best made matchine.

If you want to have really tasty coffee, you should buy coffee beans and grind them at home instead of buying coffee grinds or those cute little onesies.\nYou need to figure out which coffee / water ratio is best for your taste based on type of coffee beans (french roast is very bitter, and espresso next) and the type of coffee maker. I currently use 4 cup setting (the lowest setting) on the grinder for 6 cups of water with my drip coffee maker. I set grinder to fine although the suggestions are medium for drip coffee maker. My theory is the more contact surface the better flavor. This makes enough coffee for two to three people.\n\nThis grinder is very easy to use and easy to clean.\nThe brush is very handy to sweep out the powder that clings to container due to static. No mess no fuss.\nalways have paper towel on the counter top to catch any spilled powder.\nNo need to wash the container as long as you brush out the powder clean although sometimes it seems quite oily."

Great control over grind coarseness. Easy to keep clean. Compact, and not unsightly. This is my second DBM-8, purchased as gift for my son. Considerations: Being able to replace wear parts is a major benefit of this model. My first DBM-8 has lasted at least 6 years, and has required one part replacement. Hopper assembly has internal parts made from brittle bakelite, which I believe cracked from vibration and repeatedly being twisted to adjust grind. Entire hopper assembly was replaced for under $15. Buy one of these and use it gently for many years of perfect grounds."

I mainly use a coarse grind for my French press but I've recently started using a Moka as well and used the fine grind setting as well. It works like a charm. It needs to be cleaned every now and then especially if you use oily beans but it's simple to take apart and put back together. I highly recommend this product. Good value for the price!"

I've heard good things about the Cuisinart, so I went with it.\n\nThe hopper is useful, but I'd prefer to add the beans from my airtight container just before I grind. This one spins the grinder so fast that the beans bounce around the hopper, which means I need to keep beans in the hopper to keep the beans down.\n\nLikely related to the fast grinder action, it is a high pitch nose that wakes my toddler at 6 am, so I end up grinding the night before. The Breville was a lower tone that everyone slept through.\n\nWhen I wear this grinder out (hopefully in 8-10 years), I'll replace it with a Breville. So none of these problems are deal breakers to the point I'm returning it, but they will stop me from buying it again."

The machine was used gently a couple times a day, and only to grind enough coffee for two espressos. I suspect some electronic control inside the grinder gave up the ghost, as the machine shows no sign of life at all. I had expected it to last a lot longer than a little over two years considering it was not used to grind large amounts of coffee.\nWhile it worked, it did a satisfactory job of grinding. The grind selector is very accurate, as is the slide bar for selecting the amount of coffee to be ground. The machine does make a great presentation, resembling a miniature version of the much larger grinders I've seen coffee shops and bars in Italy.\nOn the downside, other than the lack of longevity, is that this machine is not sturdy, being too \"plasticky\" in construction, despite the manufacturer's effort to make it look otherwise by using very thin sheet metal to cover the plastic parts.\nOverall, I don't feel I got my money's worth from this machine."

This one is a little noisier and harder to clean, but it does do a better job of making a course grind.\n\nThe problem is that it clogs up if you use fresh beans that are oily. I got my beans freshly roasted from a place in the bay area and they are roasted and sent to me right away. when I get them they are really oily (i get French roast beans) and the machine clogs up very badly. If I buy stale beans from the grocery store it grinds ok, but I would rather use fresh beans.\n\nI think the problem is that the machine tries to shoot the ground coffee through a fairly small hole and since the beans are oily it clogs up immediately. I don't do espresso grind and I imagine it might clog up even worse with fresh beans if I tried to grind a fine grind."

What I like about it is that I can always have my coffee freshly ground every time, and the smell is amazing. It works fine, kind of noisy but usually grinding the beans for 4 - 6 cups takes roughly 30 seconds so it's not a big deal. The only thing is that the size of the ground beans is not homogeneous (I'm using the scientific term here but you know what I mean). Compare to the ground coffee from the store, the ground coffee from this grinder is coarser even though with the finest setting. Part of it could be really fine but as I said they are not homogeneous. What I did, to make an espresso, I ground the beans with the finest setting then when it's done I stirred the coffee powder before loading it to the machine. With the right proportion, the espresso taste good. Overall I like this grinder and enjoy the ground coffee it makes. 4 stars because the size of the ground coffee is not homogeneous."

One down side is it is very messy. The cup that holds the grounds builds up a LOT of static and when you open it, you get a little spray of grounds. Again, I am willing to put up with this because I know I am buying the cheapest burr grinder on the market, and I just wipe off the counter every day after using it. The other is that as the machine aged, it became less consistent in the amount of ground it produced. I would like to reiterate that I never cleaned my machine (by running rice through the grinding mechanism, or taking it apart and washing it) If you have never had a grinder before, start with this one till you know how much you value the superior grind. Then buy a more expensive machine if you do use it."

(no odd increments.)\n\nThe mill does produce a consistent grind - though it is adjustable, it consistently produces particles of fine grind as well as whatever coarseness you set it on. So for instance, set to a very coarse grind for use in a french press, a significant amount of fine-grind is produced. This is undesirable.\n\nIt is an okay grinder, not bad enough return yet at the same time, not worthy of praise either.\n\n--\n\nafter less than a year the safety switch in the base is malfunctioning and sometimes the grinder is UN-useable."

Once you've set it up, just push the button, let it grind, and pour the coffee into the coffee maker's filter basket.\n\nThe unit is compact, fits easily under the cabinets in the kitchen. It's noisy, but not terrible.\n\nPrevious reviews scared me about the mess it can make with coffee powder. The facts are that the output container is covered. You can remove it with no mess. When you take off the top, you get a little scatter. So do it over the sink! Then pour the contents into the coffee maker, replace the cover (over the sink) and put it back the grinder. Done! It's easier than measuring grinds out of a container.\n\nOf course, I can't speak to reliability. And as best I can tell, you can't replace the grinding parts, so if they wear out you have to replace the unit. Time will tell.\n\nAs an update. It turns out that the grind amount setting is in 2 cup increments, and at that the amounts are strange. 6 cup setting gives 40 grams, 8 cup setting 50 grams! I've downgraded my rating because of this nuisance."

As other reviews stated, not every piece of grind is going to be 100% the same size and consistency, there is some fine powder that does collect, it's true. But in reality, it's not that much and hardly worth complaining over for almost any purpose. If you have such a need, you already know that you should probably spend the $300+ on a top of the line burr grinder.

After 1 year the motor gives out and stops working (this happened on the original unit and the replacement unit). Cuisinart service is very good and they will send you a replacement within a day so you're back in business after about 4 days (accounting for shipping). The grinder is consistent in its grind so the biggest benefit to a burr grinder is you set the grind (coarse to fine), put the switch on the number of cups of coffee, and push the button. The coffee collects in the clear plastic container on the front. Burr grinders generate static so the coffee clings to the plastic container but its very easy to remove so it doesn't present a problem. I rate the grinder 5 stars for ease of use, price, and a great warranty (most grinders have a 12 month warranty) and 2 stars for the motor which doesn't last as long as it should.

When reading about the functions of this item I was impressed with ease of maintenance. I like the way that the grounds stay in the coffee drawer as well as there being a lid on top where the beans can be stored and stay fresh. I like the pre-measured portion selections that allow you to dump the grounds directly into your machine without measuring each spoonful of grounds. The fine to course selection for grinding is also very easy to use. The overall look of the machine is not bad either. We have been using this item for over a year now and have not run into any problems. Also when we got the item it was nice to get the little bonus scoop/brush this really helps to get all of the coffee grounds out of the coffee drawer once it is ground. A great purchase, really enhances the flavor of the coffee and my husband and I both agree that our coffee brewed at home is now just as good as you can get from the coffee shops. I almost forgot to mention that the built-in canister on the bottom also has a lid on it which helps to keep the grounds contained and makes for less of a mess. I suppose you could keep some ground coffee fresh for a day or so in the reservoir if you had a little extra."

I'm not a fan of this method. A handle would be preferred for noticeable grind position - as I change grinds often - making it more pronounced.\n3.) Adding a measuring line to the plastic grounds-receiver would assist in larger quantities.\n4.) The \"Coarse\" grind (French Press) doesn't seem to be much different at all from the medium grounds. When I get my beans ground from a top-tier grinder, the coarse grounds seem noticeably different.\n5.) I almost feel as if there needs to be an on/off switch to the grinder.

The first one's top \"funnel\" broke after a year or so. I bought 2 replacement funnels, but it never worked correctly after that; the replacement funnels were apparently not to the correct spec, and I had to keep downward pressure on the top during grinding or it would not run. Cheap enough to just buy a new one and hope the funnel holds up for a longer period. Grinds are consistent, without an objectionable amount of fine powder. Real coffee aficionados might complain, but for day-in, day-out use with a coffee press, I'm happy."

I've also used it with a French press equally as well. I find that the consistency of grind is partially influenced by the coffee bean. Some beans break apart more easily and thus create a finer grind than what you've chosen.\n\nMy only complaint is that flavored coffees (e.g. amaretto) leave a residue on the inside of the plastic hopper that is nearly impossible to remove. I recently soaked it in very warm water with liquid soap and the residue turned white, leaving the hopper with a frosted look. I haven't tried something more aggressive to clean it, yet...\n\nAll in all, for the price, and for 90% of the users, this is a great grinder."

Unless you are unlucky and get a factory defect, you cannot go wrong buying this grinder.

As I understand it, a burr mill grinder is supposed to grind coffee to a consistent size, which is why I bought this for him. I have a manual burr mill grinder and the beans are gravity fed into and out of the grinding area and are all the same size. This machine does not do that. I don't know why but some of the beans remain in the grinding area long enough to be reground over and over until they are as fine as dust and are next seen in the bottom of each cup of coffee. He graciously gave it back to me and it suits me fine because I use a pour-over system with a paper filter. If you want ground coffee and don't need a consistent sized grind, save 30 bucks and get the blade type. If you want a true burr mill grinder, look elsewhere."

I've been using it at a coarse grind for my french press and my coffee is uniformly perfect every time! The only criticism that i've had is similar to what's stated in the reviews- the plastic case which the grinds go into accumulates a lot of coffee dust, and it doesn't pour all of the coffee very easily. It's also a pretty large coffee grinder, which is convenient, but you should think about whether or not you want to give counter space to something this big too."

It is extremely adjustable as far as fineness or coarseness of the grounds go or the amount you want to grind. The only weird issue is that the grounds don't come out of the catching container perfectly, so I end up scraping some of the grounds off the side every time. But still a great grinder for the price and very functional and adjustable."

It's pretty easy to maintain and clean, although I found the less I do, the neater it is.\n\nAnother \"con\" which happens with a lot of grinders is pouring the grounds out can get a bit messy due to the way the grounds get stored.

With these two settings in place, the Cuisinart does the rest and does it well. There is no guessing on how many beans to grind for the cups of coffee you want. It will automatically grind the exact amount of beans for the cups of coffee you want. Our coffee in the morning has never tasted better!\n\nThe Cuisinart is warranted for one year. Our last Cuisinart \"died\" a couple of weeks after the warranty expired. Oh well. It was such a great performing and easy grinder to use that we just had to buy another one!"

This machine will take care of that for you.\nThe reason I am only giving this 4 stars is because the amount of variables that go into deciding amount/grind size of your beans. The recommendations in the users guide are very loose and basically tell the reader to experiment with grind size and quantity to determine your own favorite cup of coffee. While this is true, I fell like they should have given me more to build on. A taste chart that factors in quantity/flavor intensity/grind size/bean quantity would be extremely helpful.

But the negative reviews about the static electricity making the grinds cling to everything is incredibly annoying, messy, and inconvenient. It grinds perfectly, but either the materials of the collecting cup, or the grinder itself needs to be changed to avoid the buildup of static wreaking havoc with the grinds. You have to scrape the grinds down the edges of the cup to have the full amount of coffee for the filter, and even then, the static makes the grinds fly all over the place. Serious design flaw!"

Beyond that, it's a fine coffee grind. It is very consistent in the range between fine grounds and coarse grounds. I would recommend this grind -- just be sure to put it on a tray or some sort."

Like any grinder you will get some \"dust\" , \"cling\" etc. I solved that problem by purchasing 2 brushes, a small 1\" wide \"paint\" brush with soft bristles and use that to clear up the excess. And a stiff bristle paint brush to clean out the spout opening where the grinded coffee comes out. No biggie to clean up.( It does come with a \"brush\" on the end of the scoop but that thing is annoying to use.)\nGood price. Hope this lasts longer than my last grinder so can buy as a gift."

The hopper conveniently holds half a pound of beans. I like being able to control grind size, between espresso and drip for my AeroPress.\n\nOne important drawback is that the ground coffee doesn't flow through the grinding wheels, but instead has to move sideways through a small opening. This opening clogs up every few times I use it, and I need to take the whole grinder apart to clean out the compacted coffee grounds."

It is a bit loud and the grind selection seems to have more settings than actual grinds, that is, two notches past medium seem to yield the same grind as five notches past medium, or two notches before medium make a coarser grind than expected. Minor stuff, once you get used to it. One problem we had was the cup selector was off and the grinder didn't shut off. After I moved the selector a couple of times, it worked again and hasn't given us any more problems. Overall I like this grinder and hope it lasts a while."

Clearly states it is not for seeds or\nother items...just coffee. So, if you want a great grinder for coffee and don't mind a little noise..this is it."

The reservoir top should be at least hinged to avoid spilling the ground beans when they are removed. It is extremely load when grinding."

Using it is almost effortless: merely fill the hopper with beans (the hopper holds several pots worth of beans, so just top it off periodically), select the grind size desired (this is usually always the same but is adjustable depending on any recommendations on the coffee bean bag); select the number of cups you wish to make and press the button. The burr grinder grinds until the selected amount of coffee is produced then shuts itself off. Remove the plastic container and dump into your coffee maker. Only issue is with the plastic container. Coffee tends to stick to the sides so it may be necessary to thump it on the counter or use a knife to dislodge all grounds. No big deal. And, there's no mess, or very little, to clean up."

Piece of junk!\nI really enjoy Coffee made from fresh beans from a Burr Grinder; much superior to blade grinding.\n\nI almost didn't buy the Cuisinart DMB8 because I was afraid I would have trouble with another inexpensive grinder. After reading many good reviews I decided to take a chance and get the Cuisinart. I have been pleasantly surprised as the Cuisinart is quieter and doesn't jam when using oily coffees, just the opposite of the Ariete.It makes a full flavored cup of Coffee and looks good in my kitchen. Is has a Hopper design that feeds beans more smoothly in to the Burr, another failing of the Ariete.\n\nMy only complaint is it can be a little difficult to put the grounds drawer back in the machine; you must line it up correctly and push firmly. It is a little messy and tends to get some grounds on the counter top, but I suspect all burr grinders with the drawer underneath are just as bad.\n\nFor someone who is either new to Burr grinders or who is not in a position for a more spendy unit I would strongly recommend the Cuisinart"

Let me first say I am very familiar with coffee--we make espresso, drip, and French press regularly. The grinder itself works excellent and it's a fine size for my counter top. It has more than enough grind settings (I wish it had guidelines for where standard drip cone filter, drip flat bottom filter, espresso, and french press should be rather than 18 dots with no standard guides). My problem with this grinder is how loud the motor is and how much of a static mess it creates. The motor is SO loud and has a piercing shrill tone to it. I have 2 babies at home and we can't grind coffee in the morning because of how loud it is. It also is a mess; I've had several grinders but this one sprays static coffee grounds ALL OVER the place every single time. My counter and floor is full of coffee grounds every time."

The 1% of coffee that clings to inner wall of the container can be easily put back in it's place by a bump or two in said container.\n\nThe first problem can be avoided easily. Every single time I grind coffee using this, 99% of the fine coffee powder gets accumulated on one place inside the container. It hangs to the lid and the inner front of said container, probably with the help of the infamous static electricity. If you carefully remove the lid, place a flat thing under the powder (the wide end of the Aeropress stirrer works perfectly) and give it a little bump, all of the powder will fall on the thing so you can get rid of it however you want.\n\nDisclaimer: I have never ground my own coffee before acquiring this."

            "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Cuisinart DBM-8 Supreme Grind Automatic Burr Mill and received it shortly thereafter. Since its arrival, this appliance has been a source of frequent frustration and annoyance. I genuinely had no idea a coffee mill could be so bad. I've had coffee mills and none of them were perfect, so I assumed that the ways in which a coffee mill could be bad would be limited to poor construction or inconsistent performance. Those were issues I was prepared for. What I was not prepared for was getting coffee everywhere. Somehow this device charges the ground up coffee bits with static electricity. When the lid of the grind chamber is removed, little bits of coffee silt and chaff fly from the container propelled by some unseen force. It is very much like working with packing peanuts. Did you notice that I mentioned chaff earlier? Did you know that coffee beans have chaff? Me neither! Ok, so it isn't really chaff, but there is some sort of papery thing in the cleft of the bean. Every other grinder I've ever had has ground this up with the rest of the bean so it goes unnoticed. Not so with this thing. That papery bit gets separated and charged. And then sent flying onto the floor, counter, table, etc. I've tried using a several different varieties of coffee and several different grind settings. It isn't the coffee. It isn't the settings. It's the terrible, terrible coffee mill.\n\nI should also point out that in addition to the above stated issues, it also does a poor job of grinding coffee. Regardless of setting it will always produce plenty of ultra fine, filter clogging coffee powder as well as large chunks of coffee bean. Even though this is amongst the most affordable electric burr mills around it still isn't worth it. If you don't mind a manual grinder, I would strongly recommend the Hario Coffee Mill Slim Grinder, Mini. It's a little cheaper and produces great results. The only downside is that it's hand cranked. But really that isn't a big deal."

For the grind setting of Medium (Cuisinart), the Hario has much more variability in grind size towards the course end (more watery) and the Cuisinart has those super fine Turkish grind pieces that do indeed stick to the wall and can be easily removed.\nPros, Cons and other thoughts.\nPros:\nAccurate grind size. On Medium, it's more accurate than the Hario by far. You will HAVE to pay over $200 for a grinder that works better than this. If you want an espresso grinder and only want to pay $40 you're dilusional... looking at those 1 star reviewers...\nFast, has a timer to stop\n\nCons:\nHas a low torque, high speed motor. For some reason I expected different, but these motors are often cheaper. It's a bit of a whine noise.\nLots of dusty wasted grinds***\nYou need the counter space for this, it's not exactly small. It's similar in size to a nutribullet or similar\nAcrylic like parts. Those are notoriously easy to crack and break (we used them at SBUX where I worked)\nYou probably cannot wash anything here. I will only wipe with a wet or dry coffee filter.\nFor those that are OCD, the entire top rotates based on the grind setting lol.\nSince it has lots of fine bits in it, do not expect to use a metal permanent filter. Also, if you want great coffee, use a paper filter :)\n\nOther thoughts:\nI plan to use the \"wasted\" grinds as cold-brew coffee (maybe 8 hour infusion?) or a coffee rub for meat. Waste not, want not I guess.\nI may buy a very small sized \"colander\"/strainer meant for filtering to get out the dust.\n***For the love of everything that is decent in this world, DO NOT use a pasta strainer as a gauge for grind accuracy"

            "reviewText": "Twenty years with blade grinders, and after one month with my Cuisinart burr grinder, I'm not looking back. You know how it is with the blade grinder: the guesswork on how long to grind, the unevenness of the result, the big pieces floating at the top, contributing nothing to your brew. This grinder improves the whole experience in several ways:\n\nFirst, the beans are stored in the grinder. Refill every few days. Most times, though, when you're ready, the machine's ready.\n\nSecondly, the grind is easy to select, and the results are even and uniform. This comes through in the taste of the coffee and reduces waste.\n\nFinally, grinding is a three-touch process: turn the dial to select the coarseness you need, slide the indicator for the number of cups, and touch the \"start\" button. Grinding for 6 cups takes about 10 seconds and is no noisier than my blade grinder was. If you use the same coffee-making process and the same number of cups each time, this reduces to one touch: start. I make a pot in my drip machine in the morning (two clicks to the \"fine\" side of \"medium\") and a mug's worth in the french press in the evening (two clicks to the \"coarse\" side of \"medium\"). This grinder serves each process easily and quickly.\n\nThe small amount of fine powder produced in each batch is a minor problem. It clings to the holder, making it easy to separate from the grinds, but the powder also finds its way onto your counter. I've taken to laying down a paper towel, which catches everything and simplifies clean-up.\n\nThis product does its job well at a low price. It's improved my coffee and simplified my life. I'd buy it again."

I was disappointed it grinds for what seems like an appropriate time but I end up with a tablespoon of coffee grounds. I've tired different coffee brands and roasts nothing helps. I've adjusted the grind from the highest fine to largest course nothing changes. I've cleaned it out taken it apart and even blown it out thinking it was clogged. Nothing changes. So now to brew a normal 6 cup pot I have to grind it three times on 18 cups to get enough coffee to brew. Whatever they changed in it please change back."

This is the first mill I have ever used, so I don't have much to compare too, but overall I'm satisfied with the performance.\n\nAs usual, this was delivered to me in 2 days, as I'm a Prime member. It took about 30 seconds to assemble and use. You screw the hopper or holding bin onto the base, and plug in. You can adjust the mill to grind the proper amount based on how many cups your brewer is. The settings accomodate 4-18 Cups. I have an 8 cup pot, however, I have found that using the \"8 Cup\" setting, provides much more product than is necessary. One click of a button, and your ready to put proper amount of grinds into your coffee maker and go. My only complaint is one you will see on other reviews- the container where the grounds are sent it plastic. This causes static electricity and the \"coffee dust\" collects on the sides of the containers. To be honest, this is a minor problem to me, and doesn't affect my overall rating. Yeah, it causes a bit of a mess, but in the end, the machine does what you bought it for.\n\nFor the price and ease of use, I would certainly suggest this product to others who are looking to improve their coffee drinking experience from a blade grinder."

Heat, light, humidity, and oxygen are accelerants to deterioration of flavor and aroma of coffee. By using only freshly roasted beans and only grinding as much as I intend to use right away, I have been able to consistently produce coffee at home that is clearly fresher (and better and milder tasting) than Starbucks or most other local coffee roasteries.\n\nWhich brings me to this grinder. So far, this grinder has proven itself to be relatively clean, with a grind collection box that keeps the coffee grinds in one place. The box can be removed easily allowing the grinds to be dumped into your coffee maker. It's a pretty good design and doesn't create a mess at all.\n\nThe grinder also produces a consistent grind, which is important to consistent coffee. One poor mark for this machine is that once in a while the beans will clog and not drop into the grinding part of the machine. However, a careful lifting and shaking of the unit solved this problem.\n\nThe machine looks good on the counter top and I really appreciate the selector which automatically grinds as much as you select with one touch of a button.\n\nA solid four."

At the finest setting, it's probably marginal for a high-end machine. but it's fine for the pressurized porta-filter on this one. It makes a racket, but is quieter than an impact machine. Adjustment is simple, both for grind size and desired quantity. The hopper capacity is substantial and the see-thru plastic is convenient. The discharge hopper will leave a mess on the counter (with espresso grind anyways), unless you give it a sharp rap on the sink edge to knock the powder down before opening. As an alternative to spending hundreds on a commercial machine, this fits the bill."

So this thing has been used max 15 times. Today it continued to make noise like it is grinding but is not grinding the beans. I cleaned it out (the out-shoot was full of tightly packed grinds) and it still isn't working. It even started smoking. I think it's a dud. I would highly recommend NOT buying this. I'm disappointed, to say the least. And it's too late to return per Amazon, so I'm stuck with a dud of a grinder and no coffee for today :(\n\nWe bought this to replace our original Cuisinart Conical Burr Grinder, which we received as a wedding present over 5 years ago. After much use (several times weekly over 5 years) it stopped working. Looking to save a little money, I thought this one would be an adequate replacement. I wish I had shelled out the extra $50 for the conical one again. This one works ok. I usually make coarse-ground coffee for cold-brew (Toddy) coffee. Compared to the Cuisinart Conical Burr grinder, this one 1. is much slower to grind (takes 2-3 times as long to grind a comparable amount of beans) 2. makes a more annoyingly loud noise and 3. does not grind beans consistently. The coarse grind is does not seem much different than the other sized grinds. And, like another reviewer noted, there is coffee \"powder\" that also is made. The conical grinder makes consistently sized grinds and none of the powder. Since there is nothing actually wrong with the grinder, I do not feel I can return it, but wish I could.\n\nPros of the grinder: It is a nice-looking grinder, it does work adequately. The parts detach nicely and are dishwasher safe."

I love the settings that let you grind the correct amount for the number of cups of coffee you are making. This grinder is a lot bigger then any we've had previously so it does take up more space in our small kitchen, but other than size I am very happy with this product."

The French press coarse settings are good in terms of the resulting grain size, but they are not very consistent. Also, there is some dust and removing ground coffee can leave a bit of a mess. But overall, these are minor points, given the price. If the price were $200+, I would definitely return the item, but at $50 it's an excellent value."

            "reviewText": "The Cuisinart DBM-8 is a very attractive stainless and black automatic coffee mill at a decent price ($50); however it's an absolute steal if you can buy one of the reconditioned units at $16.99.\u00a0Factory Reconditioned Cuisinart DBM-8FR Supreme Grind Automatic Burr Mill\n\nThis mill is built around a burr grinding mechanism, which produces uniform sized coffee grounds - far superior to the results from the common blade coffee grinders that dominate the under $30 price range. I have even had good results using this mill to grind up flax seed into meal and rice grains into flour (although the end product is not quite as fine as commercial flour).\n\nThe grind selector offers 18 levels ranging from fine to coarse; however, my primary complaint is that the very finest level is not fine enough for making Turkish coffee, and only borderline for espresso. The mill is designed so that the upper burr grind plate can be removed, so in theory you could install a thin gasket behind it to reduce the distance between the two plates and produce an ultra-fine result; however, I was unable to remove the screws holding the upper plate in place so I gave up on the idea.\nThis Cuisinart is larger than most inexpensive coffee mills - it occupies about a 5\"x7\" footprint, and is 10\" high; but that's mainly because of its large capacity. It features a large clear acrylic bean hopper that holds a \u00bd pound or more of whole beans and seals fairly tightly, so it doesn't require frequent refilling. There is a slide control calibrated in cups (4 to 18) which allows you to set the length of time that the grinder runs, and the clear acrylic grounds container is big enough to handle whatever volume you chose to grind.\n\nI have had my Cuisinart DBM-8 for almost two years and it has performed faithfully. I mainly use it now for grinding meal and flours since I purchased a semi-automatic espresso machine last year that has its own built in grinder."

The good part of this story is that I called Cuisinart, gave them the model and the serial number, and they are sending a replacement to arrive within ten days. No questions asked. They also waived the shipping fee but are requiring that I send the broken one back to their warehouse at my expense. We'll see what that costs."

I called Cuisinart and they sent me a new part (after several days) that was supposed to fix this problem but it did not. Called them again today and was advised that to replace the grinder I will have to pay shipping plus a $5.00 fee and this will take up to 10 business days. To say the least, this is a time consuming headache, and it makes this machine as much or more expensive than if I would have purchased it at a local store.\n\nIf you are still thinking about purchasing this product, I would advise you to get it from a local retail store where you can return it without all the expense and hassle."

After researching the current grind and brew machines I discovered they just don't make them like they used to and most people are going back to separate grinders/coffee makers. I purchased a Cuisinart coffee maker and this grinder. I have many cuisinart products and love them. The coffee maker works great but I had to send this grinder back. I love the design with the bin of beans on top and separate container for the grinds but (like many of the other reviews said) the grinds are totally inconsistent. I read the poor review and purchased this against my better judgement because I really liked the design but it just doesn't perform. No matter what setting I placed it on (fine to coarse) the grinds were wildly inconsistent."

Even before I had had time to package the dead one up for return shipping.\n\nWe have gone to a courser grind on the replacement machine and so far, everything seems to be working as advertised.

Specifically, when I grind on medium, almost all the coffee beans are ground to that level except a small amount that is very fine that spits out on top of the rest of the grounds during grinding. However, it's hardly worth noting."

So, id take this review with a little grain of salt.\n\nI bought this coffee maker because i wanted to start making better coffee without having to break the bank and pay a $150+ for a good coffee grinder (ok ok, i know its not a ton of money but for a college student it kinda is). I had seen this same grinder at kohls for a about a hundred bucks, but when i saw it on amazon for less then 50 bucks new i had to take it.\n\nNow for the actual review. some of the pros of the machine are: it gives an incredibly even grind, and while its grinding the kitchen smells like heaven. Honestly makes the best cup of coffee ive ever had at home (when using quality beans and a nice french press). The different settings are also nice, there is a very noticeable difference between the various settings of how course or fine you like your beans ground. It also has some nice weight to it, so it seems very sturdy and well built. it also just looks nicer then most grinders.\n\nThe only real problem ive had with this machine is how noisy it is. its not unbearably noisy, but it is annoying. especially if you use it when others are trying to sleep. There are some minor issues, like the fact there is some powder that will cling to the sides of the grounds catcher. Or that the power cord is too short. but nothing that is even close to a deal breaker for me.\n\nWell, my verdict is this. Its not the nicest grinder out there, but you will not touch another coffee grinder half as good as this one without doubling the price. Its the most bang for your buck as far as coffee grinders go in my opinion."

Some days it's weak, some days it's strong. I never change the settings and brew the same way each time.\n\nThat's not even the real issue though. The issue is the DUST!! This thing is ridiculous. The dust cakes up on the top (someone else uploaded an image here that shows it) and clings to the plastic hopper on all sides. Just removing the lid causes a plume of dust scattering all over the counter. Setting the lid down causes ANOTHER! .. say nothing about scooping it out. The counter gets covered, the machine itself gets covered and it's a huge pain to clean it out every day.\n\nGranted, some beans hold more oil than others so the level of dust goes up and down with the different roasts, but it really only goes from bad to worse.\n\nOverall..

It is perfect for what it is: a value oriented upgrade from a whirly blade grinder. I've made wonderful coffee from my freshly roasted beans using a drip maker, aeropress and a french press. The coarseness is perfect for french press!\n\nYes, some of the fines stick to the container, but they are easily discarded without them getting mixed into your grounds. Also, as others have noted, the unit is rather loud. This isn't a big deal for me as I grind my beans in the garage on my workbench where I roast my coffee. If you are looking for a high end grinder for your espresso machine, look elsewhere. If you want a step up from your whirly blade grinder and you make drip coffee or coarser, you won't be disappointed!"

We were very pleasantly surprised by the improvement in flavor with the new grinder. The ground coffee particle size distribution between the two styles of grinders probably accounts for the flavor improvement. Periodically having to clean ground coffee buildup in the outlet chute of the grinder to the hopper is the only change that wasn't welcomed. But this just takes a couple of minutes about once a week to clean, and we find the improvement in coffe flavor well worth this relatively minor detractor."

            "reviewText": "I bought this six years ago to replace one made by Braun which was similar in design and function. Though I had the Braun for several years, it often had problems which I thought were common to all consumer level coffee grinders. The Braun had to be cleaned about every third time I used it, otherwise it would seize up and the engine could burn out--as my parents demonstrated with three of them in a row before my second Braun finally died.\n\nBecause I had bought a Cuisinart coffee maker, I bought this grinder simply because it matched. I didn't think it would be any better, and I was willing to go through the maintenance routine as I had for years just so I could have fresh ground coffee every time. But it turned out the Cuisinart is many times better, and makes the Braun look like a toy by comparison.\n\nMAINTENANCE: I very rarely need to do any kind of maintenance on it except sometimes when the weather is humid and the ground coffee is more likely to compact inside the machine. All I have to do at those times is take a toothpick and break apart the hard packed coffee blocking the shoot.\n\nDUMMY PROOF: Once, with the Braun this Cuisinart replaced, after cleaning it I forgot to put the bin which catches the ground coffee back on, started it to grind enough beans for a full pot of coffee, and somehow didn't realize as I walked away from it that it was spraying coffee all over the kitchen. What a mess.\n\nThe Cuisinart wont do that. If the bin or hopper are not properly in place it wont even start. So it's fairly accident proof.\n\nNOISE: It is a fairly loud machine, but very easy to quiet. I used to try wrapping the whole thing in towels and oven mitts until I realized all I had to do was put one small towel on top, and place my hands on either side of the collar if I wanted it to be quiet. Of course, most of the time I don't think about how loud it is, but sometimes if someone is on the phone or watching television in the next room I like to keep it quiet.\n\nSIZE: It's about three quarters the height and width of my current\u00a0Cuisinart DCC-2800 Perfec Temp 14-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker, Black\u00a0and the hopper which holds the beans can hold enough for at least three 14 cup pots of coffee with room to spare. I typically keep my coffee in the fridge, but unless the beans have a chance to warm up to room temperature beforehand they don't grind or taste as good.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: Short of purchasing a professional grade coffee grinder (aka 'burr mill') this is the best. I've been using coffee grinders for about twenty years, have owned a few different ones and this is 'the one' to get."

I'm sure it isn't as good as a $500 grinder. But, moving up from a simple blade grinder. We're very happy with it. It is noisy, but not more noisy than our old blade grinder. I do wish it ground a little finer. But, ground coffee works fine for espresso and cappuccinos if packed into the filter basket of our basic Krupps espresso maker.\n\nAs some have suggested, grounds do stick to the plastic bin. But, it's not a big problem for us. This grinder has markings to control how many cups of coffee for which you want to grind. We make our coffee pretty strong but find that it grinds too much. So, when we make 10 cups of coffee, we set the grinder to 8 cups.\n\nIt's too soon to speak to durability. But, we're enjoying the Cuisinart grinder very much."

Like some other reviewers, I had to laugh at the complaints that this doesn't grind well enough for an espresso machine. I use this to produce a coarse grind for my French Press coffee maker. I also use it to produce a slightly finer grind for my Mr. Coffee drip maker with excellent results for both. A couple of very minor gripes (but, keeping in mind the price).\n\nPROs: 1. Very easy to set up and use. Can't get much simpler than filling the large hopper with your beans, selecting the grind, number of cups and pressing the \"Start\" button. All markings are easy to read.\n2. Very easy to clean. All the cleanable parts come right off and into the sink for washing. The instructions say the parts are dishwasher safe, but I don't use a dishwasher so I can't comment on this.\n\nVERY MINOR CONS: 1. As another reviewer noted, this grinder produces a small amount of coffee \"dust\" when grinding. This dust will settle on your counter top when you pull out the Grind Chamber (suggestion: cleans up in about 1 second with a sponge or paper towel).\n2. Having removed the Grind Chamber to dump your ground coffee into your coffee maker, the Grind Chamber is a little tricky to insert back into the grinder - it has to be jiggled and persuaded a little bit. Perhaps I just haven't figured out the correct method yet.\n\nFor your daily morning coffee fix, you can't go wrong with this one. If you are making espresso, climb a few hundred dollars up the grinder selection."

So, please: take this for whatever it is worth to you.\nALL electric burr grinders are noisy. This unit is no exception. If you want a quiet grinder, use a manual (hand-cranked) model.\nI agree with some previous reviews: the coarse/fine grind settings are a bit misleading; Medium is a little finer than most \"automatic drip\" grinds. But I like a little finer grind than that, anyway - I set it to 2 or 3 clicks to the fine side of medium and it is great.\nThe consistency of the grind is excellent (as long as you keep the machine clean).\nThe convenience of the large hopper is a real plus for me; I only need to fill the hopper about twice a week.\nStatic is always going to be an issue with this type of grinder. Plastic seems to love the oils in freshly-ground coffee beans almost as much as I do!\nSince there is a huge disparity in price between \"levels\" of machines, if you want a well-made coffee grinder but don't want to spend $200 for it, this is a worthy choice. If I could have given it 4-and-a-half stars, I would."

The trouble started when my wife made my coffee one morning, and the French press plunger went down much less than normal. I looked in the press and there was more coffee than usual. I laughed and told my wife she must have run the grinder twice. A few days later I ran the grinder and it produced FOUR TIMES the amount of coffee it was set for. Then it ran okay awhile, until a couple of weeks ago, when it just stopped working. I checked the collection bin switch and it seemed okay, but I don't know where the coffee bean bin switch is. So I wrote to Cuisinart to ask for some advice on how I might fix the grinder, and they DID NOT BOTHER TO ACKNOWLEDGE MY EMAIL. I can take it when I get responses saying there is nothing they can do, take it to a repair shop, but I really hate being ignored. I'll be looking at other makes of appliances from now on."

Good for drip coffee and great for french press (due to a noticeable variation in grind) this grinder is a decent upgrade from a blade grinder at a reasonable price. If someone is looking at this grinder for espresso please do not do it, as someone who has tried to do so the result will be hot water quickly streaming through the grinds at the finest grind setting. If you are looking for a cheap grinder for espresso the only option for under $100 or $50 is a manual grinder and while some would argue that the time used grinding espresso manually will result in a sub par shot it will be decidedly better than the results obtained with this grinder. One caveat would be that I only use this grinder 2-3 times a week but during the months I have owned this grinder I have had no mechanical or performance issues and it has worked great for the price I paid."

Also, I like to grind a bag or two of coffee at a time so that I can bring them to work and every time I make it to the second bag the grinder gets overheated and shuts off.

She loved it so much, and I had long ago tired of my messy little cheap coffee grinder, so I treated myself to this Cuisinart. I'll never go back to preground coffee again. From espresso to a regular cup of joe in literally a minute. Fast, simple, grinds exactly the right amount with many settings from fine to coarse. Love it."

Nothing deflects the ground coffee from flying to all surfaces of the receiving container and the receiving container is made of static prone plastic. As a result the ground coffee is all over the container and is impossible to remove without making a mess. The first time I used the grinder, I tried to tamp the coffee to the bottom of the container and chipped off a piece of the guide that positions it on the grinder. Which is the reason I haven't returned it."

I have trouble fitting the plastic container where the grinds go going back into it's slot once I take it out, but I am sure that is human error. I get it back in each time after a minute but still haven't figured out why I am having trouble. This is a great quality machine. It is a larger, sturdy machine, so if you are looking for something small and compact, this is not it. I have it sitting out on my counter, and I would consider it a small appliance. I have a newly acquired pour over brewing machine and a french press. I am learning which setting works best for both.

            "reviewDate": "June 24, 2016",
            "reviewText": "From other reviews, it seems I was lucky enough to get one with a good motor, it worked well for a year in a 3 pot a day household. Then the grind rate gradually slowed, regular cleanings helped but by 15 months the burrs were so dull it could not grind a pot's worth on a single run. By 17 months it ceased to grind, practically - less than a scoop per run (medium grind, setting 18). So I switched to a different grinder, a small antique (1930's?) heavily used hand crank conical, and started looking for replacement burrs. Seems half replacement is possible via buying the entire hopper assembly (includes the top burr) for about the cost of an entire refurbished unit (sucks), wasted hours looking for compatible parts from other models, and even other brands but couldn't find a rotor head (the bottom burr ring is riveted onto a plastic rotor, no screws).\n\nA week short of the warranty expiration I contacted customer service via email for replacement. Did ask about parts, burr rings/disks or rotor aren't available but they could replace the unit, only needed to send them a shipping address, seemed great. Then a week later they replied asking for the same information again (despite it being quoted in my previous email below their reply), and with bait that for faster service I could call in instead but that the service rep would not have access to the emails, meaning a new claim and my warranty would be expired, so I stuck with email. This repeated a few times for month, then they declined replacement saying the warranty is expired. That's fraud, its purchase date to claim date, no running out the clock.\n\nThat replacement burrs are not available should be warning enough, never ever buy something non-disposable with a high-ware surface that cannot be replaced.\n\nWithout the warranty fraud, I would have rated this two stars, it really did work well for a year, good enough for a pot-a-day household to get several years of service. With replacement burr rings/disks available I'd rate it 3 stars as-is, or 4 stars if they lasted at least twice as long. But no, fraud is fraud, they crossed a line.\n\nI strongly urge everyone boycott Cuisinart. (at least for new consumer products)\n\nBetter yet, instead of buying some new cheap garbage, find something high quality, used, and with parts available, fix it up, and get years of superior service at a lower price."

            "reviewText": "I hesitate to say too much about a product that I have been using for only 1 month, but I have owned four or five coffee mills in the past and I have a bit of perspective about electric personal coffee mills. First of all, I prefer a burr style mill. The smaller mills with high speed blades grind small amounts only and it's tough to get the fineness of the grind to come out consistently. I have read that the high speed blades heat the beans as they grind them, causing some of the bean's aromatic oils to boil off in the process. The coffee would, therefore, be less flavorful. The burr mills, like the DBM-8, have fixed settings that produce consistent grind fineness at any quantity. If I am hosting a party, I like to grind a lot of coffee ahead of time. The timer and function buttons do not appear prone to sticking or jamming - a problem on some machines I have owned. The hopper holds a convenient amount of beans and they slide into the grinder without stalling thanks to the steep sides. The grinds container holds more than enough. Some grinders I have owned had a nasty habit of vibrating so much during the grind that the grinds hopper would sometimes pop forward, resulting in coffee grounds being spewed from the mechanism to the countertop, etc. The DBM-8 appears to hold the grinds container tightly enough to prevent this. So, it seems to me that this grinder is an evolved machine that doesn't have some of the problems of the less well-designed units. The price was competitive as well. I didn't give the machine five stars because I simply haven't owned it long enough to say that it is problem-free. Maybe it is a 5 star machine after all.... time will tell."

It looks great sitting on the kitchen counter all day and the adjustments allow me go from a pour over (fine grind) to a french press (course grind). I would recommend investing in something different if you will be using it for espresso's however. Also this grinder is a bit noisy in the mornings and some times it get tough to zero in consistent grind weights. Overall I think 90% of people can get away using this grinder but I would like to invest in a quieter more accurate grinder down the road."

After thoroughly cleaning the coffee grinder, it would sometimes start to work. Since that time the motor has been inconsistent. Sometimes it works - most of the time it doesn't. Not the best thing to wake up to in the morning. And considering this grinder isn't all that cheap, replacing it with a new one every 2 years seems unreasonable.

            "reviewText": "I am on day 3 with this grinder and I have discovered a couple of things with it. One, it is noisy and takes longer then my blade grinder to grind beans. Two, the middle setting for the beans creates a very fine powder for coffee that in turns makes very strong coffee that I do not care for. So, I cranked it over to the coarse setting not all the way but half way and my coffee was better this morning but still strong with the exact cup setting. Tommorrow morning I am going to crank it all the way to the coarse setting and see if that takes care of the strength problem. If not, I am going to back off the bean grind by two cups. Good grinder but a lot different then a blade grinder. You will have to fiddle with it to get the right grind for your coffee preference. Good little machine though. Looks good and grinds like a champ.\n\n3 month update. I went back to my blade grinder. I got the grind about right but this thing sucks way to much coffee. I am doing a pound of coffee a week now and previously used a pound for two weeks with the blade grinder. Also, it makes a huge mess. I am going to resell it on Amazon."

            "reviewText": "OK, other reviews have complained that it's noisy and I say \"Yes, and ...\" I mean, it's a grinder - the process involves making some noise. If you absolutely cannot have any noise before your first cup, maybe there's a Keurig in your future. I've been very satisfied with this unit so far and even happier with the price. The $200 burr grinders may have some advantages but I'd be hard pressed to figure out what they are. The grind produced is very uniform and consistent. I prefer to weigh the coffee to determine the correct amount per brew and I did see variation in the actual weight depending on the beans used. A little trial and error was needed to determine the output weight for each \"cup\" setting on the mill for different beans. The only minor quibble I have is that replacing the hopper takes a little fiddling to get it into the housing over the bottom guide pin - I could probably fix this with a small file to widen the entrance to the groove at the back of the bottom slot. Not a huge problem and it gives me something to fret about instead of the noise.\n\nUpdate - March 2018\n\nSo, experience is how we learn. I've used this grinder daily since last May. My first impression was very favorable and I opined that I didn't see the need for a $200+ grinder, yada, yada..... Well, I just unboxed my Baratza Virtuoso today and retired the DBM-8. What was the reason, you may ask? I have a couple of gripes that became more apparent. First, the DBM-8 produces a fair amount of dust (i.e. \"fines\") along with the grind. I brew mostly darker roasts that are oily beans and the fines tend to really clog the chute opening into the hopper - so much so that it needs cleaning every 4-5 uses and the hopper has to be washed every time. The second quibble is that the grinder does not feed small quantities reliably. I prefer not to store beans in the grinder - I weigh the amount I want to brew each time. If I load 40 grams of whole beans and grind, I usually get 38 grams of ground coffee with the other 2 grams either clogging the chute or sitting as unground beans in the feed tube above the burrs.\n\nNeither of these issues renders the DBM-8 unusable but I've changed my rating to 3 stars anyway. Relative to the pricy units it's a bargain and will work well for many users. I think that on an absolute rating scale, that deserves a 3. I'll keep mine around for use as a grain mill."

            "reviewText": "This grinder is very well made, sturdy. I use it to make cold coffee, and have found that a medium grind may best. I use a new paint brush (small) to clean out stray pieces of grind. But I use it totally manually: I measure a heaping half cup of whole beans into the hopper and then grind until it is all gone. I put the ground beans in a mason jar, and then add 2 1/4 cups of water, screw the jar lid on tightly and wait at least 12 hours to drink it. I also add a creamer called Hazel Nut. Up date two days later: If you do not want to wait that long for cold brew, Try this: Just grind and soak your beans with a filter your usual way. But then pour the done brew again through the same filter into a second carafe. It's a bit slower than the standard way of one time through. But you can get strong coffee without a lot of bitterness, IF you chose the best type of grind (usually not fine, but somewhere between medium and coarse.) Addendumb? #2 I finally got a STRONG but MELLOW brew! My final recipe is: 1/2 cup of whole beans, ground almost totally coarse. Heat 2 1/8 cups water to boiling point; wait 30 seconds for it to cool; pour over grounds that are in a filtered cone on top of a carafe; after water is drained through the grounds, pour this coffee over the original grounds again! This may require a 2nd carafe or wide jar. I mix in Hazel Nut Coffee Mix by Safeway, one tbls per cup. Well at least mine is not bitter. I also use a roast called \"Sweet Italian\" From Santa Cruz Roasting Co. They can mail you beans every month if you pay ahead with a credit card. Ed"

The motor burned out last week and I started to look around. I wanted to fix some of the cons with this unit.\n\nThe number one gripe is how loud it is. It is really .... really .... loud.\nThe second gripe is the static causes the grounds to cling to the hopper.\nThird would be a motor that doesn't burn out so quick.\n\nAfter researching, it appears I need to spend a lot more than I want for a substantial upgrade. I almost bought another product for $200 and at the last second reflected on this model.\n\nIt is loud and the motor seems to burn up quicker than I would like, but for $42 I can get four of these for the price I was going to pay for the upgrade. Since it makes a good cup I finally bought this same unit again."

It grinds efficiently, but it's kind of loud. Most grinders are loud though, so expect it. This grinder has a WIDE variety of settings for course/fineness of grounds. We used this for our espresso machine a few times, and had no problems. Grounds were plenty fine to allow for adequate brewing. Most of the time, we used it for our drip coffeemaker. The receptacle is made of plastic though, so static and dust is a bit of a problem, and the more you use the brush to sweep the grounds from the receptacle the worse it gets. However, for the price, this might be the best budget grinder available. We will look for a different grinder this time, that has a stainless steel or glass receptacle, but if the price isn't reasonable...we will purchase this one again."

Does an excellent job all around. The only reason I do not give it a 5-star is that it is a bit noisy.

For a great cup of coffee, I'll put up with 10 seconds of grinding noise, which it's probably less noise when compared to espresso machines at my local coffee shop.\n\nThe grinder itself does a great job, and we can taste the difference now when we grind our beans just before preparing a pot of coffee.\n\nWe love the fact that we can set the amount of beans to grind for the number of cups that we are making, and once we hit the start button, the machine automatically stops once it's reached its goal. It's better than our old blade grinder, no over-grinding or off flavor on our freshly ground coffee. I measured the coffee to check how accurate the grinder is, and it did grind the necessary amount for our morning coffee pot. After the first three uses, I had the right grind setting and I do not measure anymore - it goes straight from the chamber to the coffee pot.\n\nThe grinder is built well, the conical holder for the beans is a plus. Unlike other reviewers, we have no complaints about the price or performance so far. Other Burr grinders are more expensive, and to us it is a good buy. It's a coffee grinder after all, and better than our old one, which will now become a spice grinder."

Machine is only a bit bigger on the counter than a \"spice-grinder\" type machine but not as overwhelming as a more elaborate burr grinder would be.

It is designed for a different usage pattern than mine. I like to grind a single serving at a time and I keep my coffee beans in a refrigerated, air-tight container until I'm ready to use them. This grinder's design seems to expect you to dump a large quantity of beans in the hopper (and leave them there) and then it will measure out your portion based on your quantity setting. I find that dispensing the ground coffee is a bit more tedious than my old spice grinder, but I guess that is what is required with the more consistent grind. It does make a better cup of coffee for me ... and that's what it's all about."

The grinder creates an electrostatic charge so coffee grounds spray all over the counter or stick to the interior of the receptacle when transferring them to the filter.\n\n2. The grinder is incapable of grinding beans fine enough for espresso and too inconsistent for a French press.\n\nThis is my second Cuisinart product and found them both lacking in quality. The first, a toaster that became a fire hazard after very little usage because it wouldn't release the bread and it kept on toasting until you manually intervened. I think I'm done with Cuisinart as a brand. They seem to stress style over functionality in their products."

The finest grind setting results in a powder consistency which I can't imagine ever using, while the coarsest setting results in an inconsistent texture with chunks amid the grind. It is hard to find a happy \"drip\" grind. I like the burr grind aspect as opposed to the blade grinder I used before because the coffe is more flavorful. School's still out but you can't beat it for the price."

I usually brew 5 cups in the morning and would measure out exactly 5 scoops of beans using my Bodum 7gr/.25oz coffee scoop. I have found that I get approximately the same amount of coffee with the Cuisinart set on 8 cups. As far as grind, I started with the finest setting on Medium which produced a weak cup of coffee and now I am down to the forth setting on Fine and it's close, but still not as good a cup as the cheaper and mush simpler and LESS MESSY Krups. Tomorrow I intend to try the third setting on Fine.\nDid I mention it's MESSY! This is the reason my new purchase is going to be donated to Goodwill. The plastic collection container produces so much static electricity that the coffee literally flies all over the kitchen counter as soon as you remove it from the grinder. When you remove the top, even more mess and when you attempt to pour it out, it makes a HUGE, ANNOYING MESS!\nI made the mistake of trying to pour it directly into the coffee maker which was a disaster! I now put the filter in the sink when I attempt to fill it and at least the flying coffee is primarily contained in the sink. I still need to clean the counter and I haven't even attempted to deal with all the coffee stuck to the grinder.\nIf you like to spend as much time cleaning up as making a mediocre cup of coffee; this is the grinder for you!"

However, the replacement unit failed two days before the 30 day window expired on the replacement unit. The unit is great when it is working.

Each pot of coffee is consistent (unless we accidentally change a setting) and the coffee is ground just the way we want it. For the price, we couldn't have done any better! We are enjoying the best coffee we have had at home ever!\n\nYes, the chamber is plastic and static electricity holds some coffee to the wall, but that is easily remedied with a coffee brush. While I haven't tried one yet, there are a lot of products that remove or reduce static and if those extra 5 seconds of cleaning ever get to me, I will try one. However, for the price, I can't find anything that will beat it.\n\nI highly recommend this product."

It's good that the thing comes apart for cleaning. It's very bad that the catchment bin is made of plastic and builds up a coat of oily left over grounds in a heartbeat.

Sometimes, I have to grind up to 3 times to get the correct amount of ground coffee. I took the hopper off today to see if it needed cleaning (it did, pretty clogged in the area the coffee pours out of) and noticed that a plastic housing around the burr is cracked, so now I am wondering how long this will last.

I finally found my warranty paperwork and while it was \"near\" the end of the warranty, it was still under warranty. I could not find my invoice and finally remembered that I purchased it through Amazon and voila, there was the proof of my purchase date which was within the warranty time. So now they are requesting screen shots of my proof or purchase.\n\nCusinart quality has slipped and their warranty is not worth the paper it is written on.\nBE AWARE: Cusinart continues to delay the process so that they can give me time to go away."

I frequently use a half caff blend of premium beans that I mix myself right into the top. This grinder even works great for my expresso beans. My only complaint is that the unit is rather loud while grinding. One caution I should mention.. there is no auto shutoff when the grind container is full. I had a friend that was unfamiliar with grinders attempt to grind a lot of beans in 1 session and didnt empty the cup when full. Although she heard the motor straining, she continued to grind and burnt out the motor."

It started with a weak grind and eventually burned out completely. I used it about 4 times a week for about 10 seconds each time. That's right, less than a minute per week and it burned out. If this were a $15 cheapy model no big deal, but I bought a model that is not supposed to be junk. Customer service cordially let me know about the 18 month warranty limit and indicated that in any case I would have to ship it, and send $7 dollars as well for them to return it. It was a moot point because I am out of warranty, but I think what is clear is that Cuisinart is making products that are poorly engineered. Very convenient for them!"

I was out for maternity leave for 3 months and when I returned it was trashed! So it was time for a new grinder, but this time I opted to go for a more industrial style grinder for the heavy wear and tear that we tend to put our grinders through. This machine is awesome! But very very noisy! It sits right by my desk, so it is nearly impossible to have a conversation with someone either in person or on the phone while it is running. My other observation is that the settings for grind and cup size aren't even close to accurate! My first pot of coffee was like tar and others were too weak. So trial and error will be your lot for the first few pots."

            "reviewText": "I've had the grinder about a week now and these are my first impressions after using it 1-2 daily. Overall seems to be a decent grinder, does very well on finer grinds but more coarse grinds get some fine powder. I've used it for Clever Dripper and Aeropress brewing and really like the results with the Aeropress.\n\nMy main complaint is that it creates a ton of staticy dust. I've yet to find a way to keep coffee dust from jumping all over when I use it. Not sure if other grinders create this much, but it seems pretty excessive. It's bad enough that I'm considering an upgrade already as I'm sick of cleaning up the dust every day.\n\nUPDATE: After a few more days of use I couldn't take the dust that this grinder makes and I'm returning it. It creates a lot of static and the dust sticks in the grind bin horribly. I ordered a Baratza Encore and the difference is night and day. The grind is much more consistent and there is no dust! It is a more expensive grinder but the performance is much better."

I selected this particular grinder because it seemed to have quality reviews and was selling at a great price. My friend, who is a major coffee drinker, loves her grinder.\n\nI recently found myself in need of a new grinder, and automatically thought of this one. I ordered immediately and have not been disappointed. I use it most to fine grind coffee for my espresso machine. I love the fineness of the grind. Selecting the grind is easy, and the course grind I use for the coffee press is excellent. It is quieter than my last grinder, which is a bonus.\n\nOverall, I think this is a great grinder and would have happily spent much more money to get it. I'm just glad I didn't have to spend more!"

I had no problems with the first one, but after 5 years, it stopped working. This grinder works fine, I do not understand the negative reviews. Static and ground coffee clings to it?, well it is plastic, after a few uses and washings the static is gone, the noise? well lets be real, you have a small machine that is spinning at high RPM's to brake down a bean, build up of coffee inside the machine? I took my 5 year old one apart and found no coffee grounds inside. I use a drip coffee maker, and it grinds the beans as well as the can of coffee you buy in the store. Those that need finer ground for espresso, buy one made for that purpose. All in all it is a 40.00 grinder that works well. With proper care and cleaning after each use, I feel it will last as long as my first one. I think people expect to much out of most products. With proper care it will last for a long time, but my guess is that most folks do not take the time to really care for the items they buy, from a car to something small as this grinder. Maybe I'm just very meticulous, but I am that way with the things I own. I've gotten 351k miles out of 1 Honda Goldwing, and 250k out of another Goldwing, sold then still running, that was only 2 out of 10 motorcycles, never junked one. Some things are made cheap and that would reflect in MANY negative reviews."

I generally make 5 cups of coffee in the morning. So now I have to make 4 (too little) or 6 (too much). I'm making 6 and then leaving a bit of coffee behind in the ground coffee chamber.\nSpeaking of the ground coffee chamber, I make a mess every time I take it out of the grinder. Little coffee grinds everywhere.\nThis is also not a small piece of equipment. You're going to need counter space for it.\nWhy am I keeping this grinder again? I guess because it's okay. It's not great, it's just okay, but I don't want the hassle of sending it back and trying another one. Maybe it will break soon. :)"

You can keep a bunch of the flax seeds in the hopper, and set it for the minimum volume setting and push the start button. It stops automatically, and dispenses about 50 grams (a very rounded 1/3 cup) of finely ground flax seed powder (on the finest setting). Dump that into your fruit smoothie and viola! It's not a mess maker, and the powder comes right out and doesn't seem to get all over everything, which is nice."

You see, I also grind coffee for my church. And in that sense it has been very dependable. Now, why did I rate it 3 stars? The machine that I received will produce only medium to medium fine grind, and that is at the coarsest setting...ok for drip but definitely not French Press. I said it has been dependable and also very efficient...fast. That motor is really turning the RPMs Maybe that is why it produces a great deal of cake...very fine particulates along with the natural oil of the bean. I don't believe this is characteristic of a true burr grinder, which this isn't. It's more of a burr/blade hybrid as someone else mentioned. For those reasons I believe this unit deserves a 3 star rating."

The price - this thing was cheaper on Amazon than anywhere else that I looked.\n2. Recommendation from a friend - a good friend of mine who s a serious coffee geek has this grinder and loves it.\n3. I wanted a higher-quality grinder to replace my old blade grinder.\n\nI own several other Cuisinart small kitchen electrics and so I had confidence in this one. After using this product for about a month, I can say that I'm satisfied with it on all counts.\n\nHaving worked in a high-end coffee shop for 4 years, I worked with my fair share of high-end burr grinders. This one is definitely not that. The actual burrs are very small and lightweight but for the average American home making one pot of coffee a day, that's not a problem by my standards. The one thing that I wanted from this grinder that I was not getting from my blade grinder was consistency. This grinder produces a nice consistent grind size which makes for a nice pot of joe.\n\nThe only complaint I have so far is that it's kind of noisy (as most coffee grinders can be). If you are the earliest riser in your home and the one who normally makes the coffee while others are still asleep, I would consider grinding your beans the night before.\n\nBut other than the noise, I have no complaints with this grinder thus far. For the price I paid, I don't think it can be beat."

It's really annoying! It's in my home, I know what it does, it's written on the box!\n- An air tight lid on the top as well as an opaque bean container would be a plus to avoid the degradation of the quality of the coffee beans in the dispenser!"

It feels substantial.\n\nCons: This is a replacement for the same model I had for a little less than a year. The last one I had the whole hopper broke and came off. It was returned to sams club and I purchased this one beacause sams no longer carries this model. I liked it so much though, I bought another. It is a little on the cheap cunstruction side. But.\n\nFinal: I dont think you can beat the price. It is a nice grinder with great features. I bought one for my mother-n-law. She loves hers also. I see on the web were this model has been returned many times just because of the same reason mine did. The hopper might break down near the neck of the hopper. Personaly I think it could be rocks and stones that could have made their way into the coffee. Thats just a guess or adjusting grind whil grinding. I really did not feel like spending $100. or more for a coffee grinder, but, you get what you pay for. I think if you are looking for a grinder that cheap and grinds great, this is it. Does a great grind for expresso."

The coffee grinder was branded Cuisinart, a brand I have trusted and respected for many years. This particular grinder does not live up to the reputation of Cusiinart. The instructions claim the grinder can be set for fine or coarse grinding. Not so. The most coarse is roughly equal to \"regular grind\" coffee, and there is a lot of coffee powder so fine that it adheres to the sides of the receptacle.\nThis grinder performs roughly as well as the cheapest spinning blade coffee grinder selling for $19.95. Does anyone make a grinder similar to my manual burr grinder, but electric? This one is not it."

The ability to coarse for cold brew or super fine grind to add to my brisket rub when I BBQ has made it a valuable addition to my small kitchen. I must warn that is by no means a quiet grinder but for the price you can't go wrong. I have had this grinder for 6 months and have used it almost daily, it has worked flawlessly.

It's easy to select the grind consistency and the number of cups you'll be brewing, and then the grinder shuts off automatically when it's done its job. It is a bit noisy, but it is a burr grinder after all. It does a much better job that the less expensive blade grinders, so the cost and noise are definitely worth it."

I was planning to give away my $20 Krupps grinder I bought twelve years ago but have to keep it to grind espresso. At its finest grind, the Cuisinart doesn't even come close to the grind I'm used to for espresso. As a medium to very course grinder, I have no complaints. If I thought I got a defective product, I would just return it (I still might) but I really think that this is as good as it gets for fine grind."

Compared to other burr grinders we have owned, this one is a bit louder, but seems to grind much faster. The container that receives the ground coffee has a cutoff switch that will not allow the grinder to work if the container isn't fully seated. This is a bit too sensitive. It can get clogged by stray grounds and need to be cleaned with a brush.\n\nIt seems to work better for regular drip grind than powdery espresso grind, but it is definitely a passable fine grind."

It seems to be a great match for my espresso maker though so I am satisfied. The design of the grinder is great. The storage compartment is convenient (especially if you've ever used one of the small grinders). If you're one of those with a really nice espresso machine I would spend the extra money for a nicer grinder or you will probably be disappointed. If you have a lower end espresso machine or normal drop coffee machine this grinder will do the trick."

Anyhow, it's worked well to provide coarse ground coffee. Although it does produce a lot of coffee dust which will stick to the sides of the hoppper. I would probably not buy this again.

Espresso is the only thing I use it for and the DBM-8 at the finest setting is not even close to fine enough to be consider an espresso grind, as far as I'm concerned. Also it's very loud and grinds a crazy fast speed so the coffee oil get's lost in the spin cycle. This kind of grinds like a blade grinder but it a burr head. Way too fast for fine grinds.\nThe grinder I was replacing (Capresso) has settings from coarse to extra fine. I use the fine setting and it turns the bean into a talc like powder. I don't know what the ultra fine would do! The Cuisinart just doesn't compare to the grind I get form the Capresso. I will spend the extra few bucks to get the right grinder...Maybe for regular coffee this is ok but I don't know that for sure since that isn't what I bought it for.\nBack to amazon this grinder goes...."

            "reviewText": "I strongly recommend the Cuisinart DBM-8 Supreme Grind Automatic Burr Mill. It is cheap ($50) for a burr grinder (burr is the only way to go for a consistent grind, blade grinders are cheaper but waste coffee), very easy to keep clean, and has a good sized storage hopper for beans. Intuitive controls (select # of cups, hit START), and automatic shutoff means no measurements are required. Simply grind and empty the contents into your coffeemaker. The grind selector is integrated into the hopper, so going from coarse to fine is as simple as turning the hopper to the desired size.\nPlus, it is a good looking addition to any kitchen."

So far I have left it set to four cup mark on amount to be ground and that works good for my two cup (12 oz.) Bialetti porcelain coffee dripper. One problem is the girders prodigious coffee dust production, sort of messy. Keep your damp sponge handy. The motor seems powerful and makes short work of the grind. I tried a hand crank burr mill and I could not take the long, boring, tiring crank turning ordeal. This DBM-8 seems like a good, sturdy appliance for the modest price. It is OKAY."

It took a few emails back-and-forth to get them to send me a replacement, with each very simple response from Cuisinart taking a week or so. So that added up to a long time. And then, even though it failed under warranty, they required me to pay the shipping in BOTH DIRECTIONS for a replacement. That added up to almost exactly half the cost of the grinder. So even though I like the product, Cuisinart is real low on my list of brands to buy in the future."

The unit was so full of packed grounds that the lever to select how much coffee to grind would no longer move. The second attempt at internal cleaning failed so the unit had to be replaced. Somewhere inside this machine, there needs to be a seal/gasket to keep the grounds where they belong.\n\nThe grounds it makes are fine, the noise is expected and there's a lot less static cling than with our new one, the capresso infinity, possibly because of the stainless housing or the lid on the grounds receptacle.\n\nWe grind for french press coffee - quite coarse. I imagine that with finer grind settings there could be more lost coffee to the internal areas of this machine.\n\ninfo not on the website.. made in China."

For cold brew you need course ground coffee which the professional machines at the stores do a great job of, this machine not so much. There isn't much difference in this machine between the grinds.

It does the job very well for drip coffee, although it doesn't really get fine enough for great espresso. It all depends on what your expectations are: if you want a professional espresso grinder, grit your teeth and spend the money on something better. If you are looking for a reliable grinder for everyday use in a drip coffee or French press unit, I would say that this is well worth the (satisfyingly small) investment."

            "reviewText": "I originally purchased a this type of grinder under a different name from a wholesale club over 5 1/2 years ago for approximately $29.00. That coffee grinder lasted for 3 1/2 years before it stopped grinding mid grind. The coffee I have used for the last 10 years is Starbucks Breakfast Blend or more recently Starbucks French Roast Beans. The grinding pattern I use is to grind enough coffee for a 12 cup pot. I pour 4 cups into a large coffee cup and the remainder in a carafe which I use for 2 more days microwaving my coffee. So essentially I use the grinder for a pot for a fresh pot of coffee every 3 or 4 days. In December 2012, after my no name brand died after 3 1/2 years of service I purchased the Cuisinart DBM-8 Coffee Mill Grinder from Amazon.com. I was excited that It appears that Cuisenart purchased the no name brand raised the price, and now I was getting a name product. Little did I know that 10 1/2 months later, my \"Cousinart\" would stop and burn out while grinding Starbucks coffee beans. I called Amazon they, contacted Cousinart and I received a new replacement for the burnt out unit in October 2013. In that time frame, I was doctor restricted diet for over four months, one month in Florida and personal leave for 2 1/2 months where I did not grind or drink any coffee. So from October 2013 until January 1, 2015 (a total of 15 months), I did not grind any coffee at all for 6 1/2 months and the remainder of the time I used the grind coffee and make a pot every 3 or 4 days, the effective use I got of the replacement was 7 months. I called Amazon, they looked into a record and saw that the replacement was handled by Cousinart. I called Cousinart and basically they told me the warranty period from the original purchase and there was nothing they could do. I got the Cousinart Customer Service Manager address and plan on following up with him regarding the shoddiness of the product they sell. In all fairness Amazon refunded my purchase price (less restocking fee) as long as I return the burnt out unit in 30 days. I was going to purchase another Cousinart Grinder/Mill from Amazon until I saw the price was almost $50. I decided against wasting my money again on a poor quality product that lasted only 7 months of effective use and a company that uses loopholes like using the original purchase date as the warranty date and not the date I received a new replacement product as the warranty date. I ended up purchasing a Capresso Coffee Grinder which was pricier but I am sure has to be higher quality than the product Cousinart sells."

I always get complements on the look of the grinder and the taste of the coffee. The largest downside of the grinder is it can be very loud which is not good for an office setting."

Grinding a supply and then measuring out the desired amount would rather defeat the purpose of grinding just before use."

So, I turned to amazon-price was similar, our old grinder could not store any beans,so to use always had to fill with beans. This is so much easier. My one complaint is that it is NOISY-so if you are trying to make coffee while others are sleeping, grind the night before! Otherwise, we love it and it looks great on the counter top with my other stainless appliances."

The only two gripes I have aren't much, but they are gripes nonetheless:\n\nThe vessel in which the grinds deposit collects so much static that it's mostly impossible to clean without the tiny coffee grounds flying every which way. There is a constant coating of very fine grinds all over the vessel and wall behind it, even if it's set to the coarsest grind. Without a tiny vacuum, it's hard to clean. The grinder won't run indefinitely. If you fill the hopper all the way up and set it to the largest amount, which is 18 cups, it will still stop halfway through with the vessel only halfway full of grinds. It means doing multiple batches if you're brewing a large amount (like for a cold brewer, etc). That said, it's great and I'm glad I own it."

It's so affordable that I wouldn't be upset if I had to buy another to replace it after a few years use.\n\nSo far I have had this one around a year or so with no problems at all.

You'll be greeted by the satisfying aroma of freshly ground beans. This is not a premium conical grinder, and it makes a bit too much dust for my taste. Most of this sticks to the ground coffee container at the top, close to where the grind emerges, so you can just leave it there while you're scooping grounds and brush it off when the bin is empty. A terrific value, nicely constructed, far superior to cheap blade grinders."

We use the grinder on its medium setting, and yet we seem to get a lot of fine coffee particles that stick to the sides of the plastic hopper. I use my finger to knock them out in the trash before putting the rest of the grounds in the coffee maker because I'm convinced that the fine grounds make the coffee way too bitter. There's always grounds coming out from the back of the hopper on to the counter top. So... if you're a neat freak like me, steer away from this model. Last thing.. we tend to use oily french roast beans. I think they are contributing to the sticky dust issues and also seem to cause the feed hopper to get clogged. Not a total waste of money, but I'd take my blade grinder back over this."

Got it out this morning to grind some beans and it did not work...the grinder was completely tits up! So I had to get out my old Braun KSM2 to do the job. The Braun does not hold as many beans as the Cuisinart. With the Braun you have to guesstimate the texture of the grind; course, medium or fine since there is no selection setting. But it gets the job done. I've had the Braun for over 20 years. I won't purchase another Cuisinart and I certainly don't recommend them. If you can't get at least 5 years out of an appliance then it's not worth having....instead of buying a cheap Cuisinart DBM-8 go ahead and spend a little extra money and get a Braun KSM2 or a similar quality coffee bean grinder."

Set a couple of dials for how fine you want to grind your beans and how much you want to grind. The ground coffee beans fall into a container on the bottom of the machine which is easy to take out and enable you to scoop out with a measuring spoon. In a manner of minutes, you have fresh ground coffee grinds ready to brew. It is a little pricey but sure beats the cheaper brands where you have to empty out your grinds every few tablespoons of beans and then have a mess trying to transfer it into a container."

Cuisinart has proven the adage once again. You get what you pay for!! My advice is spend the extra $150 and get a good conical burr grinder and save yourselves the aggravation and money wasted on unusable coffee..."

It is quieter than other Grinders that I've used in the past, and I like that there's extra capacity for grinding more beans. The only small beef that I've got with it as it it seems like it has more static electricity then other Grinders that I've used in the past which causes beans two flake and fly away when I pull the lid off. Not sure if that's just because of the environment or the machine so I'm not going to hold it against it. Definitely would recommend. Also like how well the top seals up to keep the air out and keeps the beans fresh."

This has a more consistent grind which is the point i guess. There's a few things i don't love about this machine though despite all the great reviews.\n\nCons:\n1. The \"Cup Switcher\" makes no sense to me. Nor does it seem to do much. The never really explain it very well and it seems like you're just guessing when you're using it. Also, it holds 1/2 pound but you can only grind like 1/3 of that if you use the max cup setting. So what's the point of having it hold so much if you have to dump out the ground stuff 3x's.\n2. It's pretty slow. I could fill up my coffee canister twice as fast using my old grinder vs. this one. Maybe all burr grinders are slow.\n3. It's loud. Most are but this seems really loud and whiny (maybe not unlike this review! haha).\n4. There's a small corner where much finer ground coffee builds up in the catch cannister. Isn't the point of a burr grinder to have a more consistent grind? If every time i'm getting this micro dust it isn't really that consistent is it?\n\nPros:\n1. I like i can fill it up, push a button and come back."

I do not need a lot of coffee ground at once, and even the 4-cup setting is too much for a full K-cup size. I usually leave it halfway between 4 and off. The automatic feature makes it great as well as a removable basket for dumping wherever you need it. Personally I do tend to think the coffee tastes better. Maybe it does not heat up the grounds like a grinder . . . For those who thought that a burr style grinder make more even grinds, it does not with this model. No matter the coarseness I choose, there is always some powder that shoots out as well as larger chunks. I usually do not see the larger chunks until I am rinsing them down the disposal (good way to help remove the smelly disposal smell). I am happy with this model and it works well for my application, be wary if you are especially picky about even grounds."

I priced other burr grinders and they were very expensive so I ordered this one for a start. We really like the fact that we just push a button and grinding is done quickly. We have found that, even though we like strong coffee, we can turn it to a medium setting and still get the same flavor.\nOur only complaint is similar to a few of the reviews I had read earlier - that the grounds stick to the plastic container because of static electricity. Otherwise we are very happy with our purchase!"

It now requires four cycles of the 12-cup position to grind enough beans for an 8-cup carafe. One reviewer has suggested rigorous cleaning, but even that is of no avail. It goes for replacement (along with my $4) tomorrow, but I expect the same results. Instead,the writer who recommends a simple untimed blade grinder may be on the right track.\nThis unit was replaced under warranty by the factory at minimal return shipping cost. The replacement has been in daily use for several months and appears to be entirely satisfactory. Perhaps the key to my current pleasure is daily cleaning of the \"exit window\" which feeds the ground coffee into the collector. Build-up there can accumulate thick and fast and interfere with operation."

What I love about the grinder is the ease of use and no longer needing to measure out coffee beans, you just select the number of cups, hit start, and presto, you have just enough grounds for your desired amount. Would give it 5 stars if it was just less messy, but certainly not a deal breaker."

The coffee grinds stick to the container into which it grinds. Getting the ground coffee into the filter is no small feat. But, we tolerated that until the machine stopped working properly. It would get stuck and whir annoyingly, even though there were plenty of beans to grind. We would shake it gently or tap it to jar it into action. That worked for a while. Now, just 6 months after buying it, it has pretty much stopped working. I waited on hold with Cuisinart for 15 mins to find out that while the device is still under warranty, I have to pay $10 for them to ship me a replacement and then I have to pay to ship my defective device to them! That's about 1/2 of what I paid for the machine in the first place!"

I only paid $49 for the grinder and they want $22 for shipping. I don't understand why Amazon can supply shipping for their Prime customers, but their suppliers can't follow suit.

I'm just lucky I looked at my coffee before making it, if I had been particularly tired that morning what would have happened???\nFor the record I have NEVER ground anything in it other than coffee. Occasionally I buy coffee with hazelnut pieces in it but if hazelnuts could ruin this thing, IT'S STILL A PIECE OF CRAP.\nNot to mention the container your coffee grinds in to sucks. It's impossible not to get grounds everywhere, when you pull it out of the machine they go flying everywhere. Some grinds even fly out while it's grinding.\n\nOverall, IT SUCKS!

Even after cleaning every aspect of the grinder, this product works terribly. I called customer support and their policy is that you pay to ship in the product for return before they send you a new one. If you have that kind of time in your life, then take a chance. For me, it costs me more to return this product than to purchase a new one from another brand. Terrible experience with their customer service team whom only wanted to get me off the phone."

They quoted $28 to ship a $38 bean grinder, I could live with that, as in Canada the grinder sold for about $80. But it didn't quite work out that way; first off, UPS couldn't find our house (in an older Ottawa neighbourhood) and then had the gall to charge us a $22 \"brokerage\" fee. So, in the end, UPS charged us $50 to ship a small, $38 grinder. If you do buy anything from Amazon.com, ensure the vendor uses United States Postal Service, they don't charge \"brokerage\" like greedy ol' UPS."

That fine dust and the oils build up and clog the exit hole after a few days of use on medium grind setting. Good thing it only takes about 5min to clean the clog and its good as new. If you are a coffee snob and can't handle the inconsistent grind and dust this creates I would steer clear."

It has the same noise level as any typical grinder.\nIt can go for many batches in a row, I did around 10 or 11 and it didn't overheat or have any trouble. (This was a problem I'd had with other, more expensive, grinders).\nIt does cause quite a bit of static and grinds fly a bit. But I prepare for that by clearing a space on the counter and holding the dispenser deep in the filter when emptying.\nDealing with the static is much easier than dealing with a grinder that overheats and stops working all together.\nSo far, I love this grinder!"

I then tapped the hopper to get the beans un-jammed. Had to to this several times until the unit stopped grinding. I then removed the hopper and poked my finger up to remove the jammed beans. I accidentally touched the grinder (ring), it was HOT!\n\nI'm gonna give it another try, this time w/ half a cup of beans and more coarse grind setting to see what happens."

Called Cuisinart and they want me to sent it back on my own shipping expend and 10 dollars for processing fee. I don't think I need to spend another amt of dollar after wasting my 50$ for the grinder that didn't work after 1 month of used. Its under the warranty but why do I have to send them 10 $ plus I have to pay shipping for there crappy grinder. Why should I waste my more money for the same crappy grinder. Its not worth the price at all. Get at Costco for the same price and when its stop working you can return it at anytime with no hassle."

            "reviewDate": "May 20, 2016",
            "reviewText": "Let me open by saying, I have a lot of experience with high end, conical burr grinders and blade grinders of all sorts, from commercial and european models to the smaller and hinkier consumer models, so I am no novice when it comes to coffee or grinding. While this seems like a nice (thoughtfully designed, good looking) grinder, it has many faults. I am really disappointed. I looked forward to having a burr grinder for the consistent grinds they offer, but this one falls short on too many counts for me to keep using it. Now I've thrown the cost, three times higher than the blade grinder I replaced, of this unit away, along with the unit. First, it's loud, compared to it's much smaller relative, the Cuisinart blade grinder, and loud for a long time, as it goes through the full cycle. Don't try to converse with company and make coffee at the same time. Second, beans frequently get stuck in the hopper so the grinder has nothing to grind for a moment. Since the amount of coffee is determined by a length of time, this throws off the coffee measurement in the grinds cup. Sometimes, beans get stuck early in the cycle, leaving you with little or no coffee in the chamber. I find myself jarring and hitting the unit like a mad man, to try and get the beans to fall into the grinding cone. A bi-product of the plastic chambered burr grinding process, this unit also charges the grinds with static electricity as they accumulate in the plastic chamber. So, when you tap the chamber out into the brewing basket of your coffee maker, these charged grounds fly everywhere, making a mess. If you are using this unit for an espresso machine, the grind cup is too awkwardly shaped to easily scoop the grinds out of, cleanly. Finally, Burr grinders are supposed to have a very even grind, well, in this case, no grounds are too big, which is great, but much of the grind is powder, which makes for muddy last sips. Overall, I cannot recommend this grinder to anyone, for any reason."

The only problem with it is the grind hopper does not stay in place while you are grinding the beans. You can't set it, walk away, and come back to a hopper full of grinds. You literally have to stand there and push and hold the hopper in place so that the safty cut-off sensor, doesn't interrupt the grinding process. This is extremely inconvenient for when you are grinding a full hopper of beeans."

It appears to have different strings to grind different consistencies, but all settings create the inconsistent grinds. Some coarse, some fine and everything in between. The grounds are also plagued by static electricity so when you try to transfer the FOUND from the grinding container to the filter, little bits stick to your hands, counter and coffee maker. I'm seriously disappointed."

This is a good grinder for people who are grinding for coffee in either a drip or french press. It will give a good grind. I purchased this grinder to grind espresso for my $399 Breville espresso machine. Even on the finest setting available it will not grind fine enough to work on a good espresso machine. For those of you looking for a grinder to grind good espresso for you machine this is not it. After I ground some espresso at the finest setting I could feel it was still to course, but I put it to the test with my espresso machine. I pulled a 2 ounce shoot in about 8 seconds, this is way to fast and left me with a stong cup of brown water. So I did give it 3 stars because it is well built and has many settings.... just not for espresso!!!"

I've never reviewed on that basis. The storied name of Cuisenart convinced me to buy this appliance at what seemed a great price. But it is still true that you get what you pay for. I've used it four days, experimenting with different degrees of coarseness. The result is there is always a lot of powder mixed in with grounds. It looks like I will have to dig around and see if I still have a percolator, because using this grinder, drip coffee of all grind consistencies is almost as weak as water and a terrible waste of some fine and costly coffee beans. Although I probably will just accept that I'm a coffee rube and go back to the blade grinder."

It does produce the proper grind for its intended use, however.\n\nCannot fault the equipment as it does what it was advertised to do; perhaps should be used in a setting where copious amounts of freshly-ground whole roasted coffee beans are produced. Like an upscale coffee canteen in a hoity-toity commercial office somewhere.\n\nIt turns out that the machine is just a little-much for the home breakfast coffee preparation in the morning using a one-cup French press!"

And, for the record, I do not expect it to last a long time. A year tops. It is an inexpensive grinder, and to expect any more than a year from it is insane.

I would compare it to using a blender.\n\nGrinding Options:\n-I read other reviews before purchasing and I knew what I was getting. The different grind settings is wonderful. However as other reviewers have said, it doesn't produce coffee grounds that are consistent (refer to photos). There is definitely fine powder coffee that comes from it even on the \"course\" setting.\n-The option to decide how many cups of coffee works great. I can choose different options from 4 cups to 18 cups worth of coffee grounds.\n-Also having the ability to hold extra coffee on top is another reason why I choose this one over others.\n\nMessy:\n-The grinder leaves a slight mess after pulling the coffee grounds container out (refer to photos).\n\nSo why 4 stars? Because the product cost $50, it works and I'm far from a coffee connoisseur. If you want a grinder that grinds more consistently or is quieter, then I recommend you go and spend more then $50."

But not something needed every day. The oil from the beans makes the grounds stick a bit to the sides, but that is to be expected, and it's not such a big deal. Finding how to remove the top hopper also takes a bit, but it's easy. Just rotate COUNTER clockwise (in the direction from fine to coarse) and keep rotating past \"coarse\". Keep spinning the hopper in the same direction, and it eventually comes off and lifts out. Assembly is just the opposite. Usually don't even worry about it when changing beans. Really cleaning it out might take more time and some extra effort.\n\nNoisy? Not really bad. Hey, it's a grinder. If it were silent I'd be shocked.\n\nFor the money, overall, I'm impressed.

Once that bar is pressed, you can walk away and let the grinder do its job.

Shazam, you're done.\n\nNow, sliding the emptied container back into the mill can be a bit tricky at first, (my husband still doesn't get it), but once you get the knack - - no problem."

I'm not sure how it works as far as grinding beans any finer than the 3 coarsest settings because that's all I have ever used, however I do find that while grinding a half# of beans it does give you quite a bit of fine grind along with mostly coarse ground beans. I have been told though that that is the nature of the beast with a flat disc grinder. On the plus side though, I don't have to worry about it too much if I am using the Toddy maker because their thick material filter catches over 99.98 % of the fine ground beans. Using it for another cold brew system with the metal filters results in a lot of coffee dust in your brew however, and you will need to strain it through a paper filter if you want clean coffee.\n\nThe cup timer is a nice addition, although I usually only use it on 18 cup setting. For me, running the whole hopper takes 2 full 18 cup settings + a bit. Just remember to use the included brush to clean the dust out of the hole where the grind comes into the removable container.\n\nOh and I get lots of static after grinding coffee, perhaps because I like very dark roasts. The trick to that is to wet your fingers under the faucet and spritz a wee bit of water on the beans before you grind and it really cuts down in a big way the amount of static, so you don't end up with lots of grinds all over the counter."

The motor seems to take it all in stride, and it's never sounded like it was under undue stress, so I'm puzzled by all the reviews reporting bad motors. I suspect, at least some of them, are really interlock problems. There are at least two of them: one is under the cup that collects the ground coffee. The other is under the hopper. If the cup or the hopper aren't properly seated, the motor is prevented from operating. This is a safety feature.\n\nThe flavor of coffee ground in a burr mill barely resembles that of beans chopped up in a grinder with spinning blades. The spinning blades keep hitting the coffee over and over, heating it up. If you watch, you will see the coffee turn a lighter shade of brown as it dries out. A burr mill spits the ground beans into a cup as soon as it's finished with them, and the grounds are the same shade as the beans were. The difference in flavor is tremendous, so recommending a burr mill, such as the cuisinart, is a no-brainer.\n\nUpdate Jan 09, 2007: We've been grinding for about 16 cups per day for about a year now. Still going.\n\nUpdate July 27, 2009: 3.5 years of faithful service, but I have to admit that I'm starting to get paranoid. This thing has done a lot of work, and something has got to be on the verge of going out. I'm addicted to my morning coffee (I drink it ALL morning), and I'd be in a bad way if I couldn't partake of my favorite bean. I'm considering buying another one as a back-up.\n\nUpdate Feb. 5, 2011: 5 years, and still grinding."

So if you're not ready to make that plunge, this is a great model in its price range. Just know it's best suited to making big ol' pots of coffee and nothing fancier.\n\nThe main difference between this and a higher end unit is the inconsistency in the grind. About 90% of the output is exactly what you want, and the rest is a fine powder that builds up on the grind container, clogs your coffee filler, and eventually manifests itself as sludge in the bottom of your mug. It's not the end of the world but it's noticable.\n\nYou should also know that this thing is LOUD. I know all grinders make noise but this one really takes the cake."

We kept having to re-seat the container multiple times before the device would turn on.\n* The hopper rotates way too easily, so it takes little effort to accidentally change your grind quality.\n* The grind consistency was questionable. It certainly didn't allow things through that were too big, but we were also getting a lot more \"dust\" than expected. This had a significant negative impact on our pour-over filters, as they were clogging much faster than normal.\n* The device seemed to have a problem with static electricity. The aforementioned dust would stick to the walls of the container. Any attempt to open the container always resulted in a puff of coffee grounds that settled on all the nearby surfaces.\n* It's loud.

            "reviewText": "I have used this for about 12 years without any problems. It is easy to adjust the grind (just rotate the whole hopper at the top). The grind is not super even, but much better than the crappy blade grinder I had before. There is a sliding switch to adjust the amount of coffee being ground (I am pretty sure it is just a timer), but the numbers wore off and it is hard to tell how many \"cups\" I am grinding so I set it up for about 4 cups using trial and error. If I need 8 cups, then I just hit the start grind button twice. Mine tends to grind on the fine side, so for drip coffee, I usually set mine on the most coarse setting (out of about 14 positions or so). I don't know why people say you can't use it for espresso (not fine enough) - mine will make talcum powder grounds on the first 4 settings. The collector cup in front can be a little difficult to pull out as it is held in by detents to the machine and it is smooth rounded plastic on the sides - it would be nice to have a little texture on the sides to help pull the cup away from the machine. When the hopper is almost empty, the last 2 or 3 beans tend to just bounce around off of the burrs - not a big deal. For the money, I think it is a good grinder. I would like more consistent and coarser grounds, but it looks like I will need to spend about 4x as much."

            "reviewText": "I bought this grinder a couple of months ago because I was grinding my coffee in one of those spice grinders which made it either too fine or too coarse. Then I read some reviews on this Cuisinart (after buying it...dumb), and I almost returned it. Most of the reviews said that it was not good for espresso machines, the motor would burn out, etc., but thought I'd take a chance and give it a try. I love it! I only make espresso for myself and the beans are ground perfectly, but when company comes and I want to make a large pot in my ICoffee machine (in which the beans need to be ground at a perfect medium level) it also does the trick. It works well with my coffee press too. I am a coffee freak as you probably already have noticed, and I love my coffee rich and strong. People who burn out this machine probably do not clean it. About once a week, especially if you use dark oily coffee beans, you need to brush out the grinding components with a small slightly stiff brush. Buy a couple of different angle small brushes for this, and make sure you clean the grinders. Don't be lazy. Maintenance is the key to keeping to keeping any appliance working properly. Cuisinart rocks with this product! It's reasonably priced and does the trick."

Then we got progressively cheaper coffee and never really noticed the error of our ways.\n\nThen we would go visit to people that had a Keurig and wow, this coffee is good. Thing is, a Keurig is expensive and the coffee pods are ridiculous in cost and an environmental pain. So we thought it over and we thought why not some decent bean coffee and keep our old Bunn 10 cup? So that's what we did but we're back to the blade grinder.\n\nSo for 1/3rd the cost of a Keurig, we got ourselves this grinder. We use medium roast store brand from Costco. This, my friends, is some of the best coffee I have ever had and I know it's the preparation that's making the difference.\n\nFor the bunn, one wants to use 1.6oz of coffee. I set the grinder to medium grind, 10 cups, and it was spot on the 1.6oz we needed, very first time, so the calibration is right for us.\n\nSo I write all of this to tell you if you are considering a Keurig, don't. Just get yourself a decent coffee pot (I recommend a Bunn 10 cup) and this grinder. You'll be happy you did."

If you prefer French press coffee, it is impossible to get a suitable grind from this machine. The grinding surfaces are simply a couple of narrow rings that are parallel to one another with small teeth on each -- no conical burr grinding in this unit.\n\nWant to grind all of the beans that you put into the hopper? Forget that too. The last few beans will ricochet around the inside of the machine indefinitely while the machine gets louder and louder. The motor will likely burn out before those last beans are ground into a fine powder. The built in timer will cut things short long before all the beans are ground even on its longest setting, probably to save the motor.\n\nWant to keep your counter clean when transferring the finely ground powder from the clear bin? Forget that too. First, you have to remove the lid which sends the powder flying, so working over a sink or a trash can is must for the transfer. Trying to remove the statically charged fine powder from the main bin is even messier. Have lots of paper towels handy.\n\nWant to thoroughly clean the unit? Forget that too. There are plenty of seams and grooves in the case to catch those impossible to remove fine coffee grains. Sure, the hopper and top grinding surface can be removed and run through the dishwasher, which is great. The same is not true of the lower grinding surface, and what lies beneath. I can see this area getting caked up with fine powder in very little time.\n\nPlease do yourself a favor and look elsewhere to meet your coffee grinding needs."

I have to admit, it has been a workhorse when it does work. There were two times in the past few years when we heard weird grinding sounds, and after dumping out the beans, we found tiny screws that had fallen out of the grinder's inside mechanisms. The grinder clogs if you grind too much without cleaning the chute out and the grinds have a tendency to fall out. Lastly, it is extremely loud so if you have to prep for the morning, do so when you know it won't disturb other people in the household.

I may have gotten away with never cleaning my machine because of the grind size which can cause more or less blowback dust. I would expect much more blowback with a fine grind than with a course grind. If you have never cleaned your machine, how can you call it junk when it stops working? Cuisenart has always been a quality company. Go spend 3 to 10 Times the cost of this grinder on an expensive one and you will find the same things happen on all of them.

I've watched a week to write this but my feelings since Day 1 have not changed.\n\nFor ~$38, you should not expect miracles but the device should still fulfill its general intended purpose satisfactorily, plus meet its manufacturer's claims.\n\nDoes it grind coffee? Yes\n\nBut the consistency of the grind is a wide spectrum. In its almost \"Fine\"est grind setting, you get tiny particles that make their way through an espresso shot filter (I.e. turkish grind!) to coarse, drip coffee chunks. See the attached zoomed in picture. This drawback substantially decreases the flavor and texture of most coffees you'll make since (1) variable grind will make it impossible for you to get the right flavor profiles and (2) you'll always get a weird, distinct sandy texture/taste from the particles that make it through your coffee filter. Unpleasant even with the finest beans. And, it makes the centerpiece grind dial pointless.\n\nDoes it deposit the coffee grounds into a container? Yes\n\nBut all those coffee particles I mentioned as being omnipresent are also VERY charged from the metal grinder (drawback from not using a ceramic grinder). The moment you open the container, or even detach it from the grinder, the coffee particles go flying everywhere in the kitchen (no matter how carefully you open the dispenser). Every use of this grinder creates a giant mess unlike I've experienced with any other device. The coffee particles will get on you, on your counter, on the grinder, and probably your floor.\n\nWith the negatives that I've highlighted (of which there are others that you can read about in the reviews), I can certainly understand why this machine does not have a long lifespan with its design.\n\nThe price of ~$38 is hard to ignore but it's a purchase you'll bemoan every time you use the device. I would not recommend this to anyone, not even for the office drip coffee club."

The cup that receives the grind is often quite sticky and hard to put in the device. On further research, I understand that there are at least 2 kinds of burr grinder, flat and conical.

            "reviewText": "Purchased this to replace a chopper type grinder and it does indeed make for a more flavorful cup of coffee. Beyond this, I mostly have complaints. The unit could really benefit from a redesign.\n\nStarting at the top: to adjust the grind setting the entire bean hopper must be turned. I was very surprised to learn this. Rather than the dial at the base of the hopper simply turning freely, the entire hopper needlessly must turn. So unless you like your grind at the perfect center \"medium\" the grinder sits on the counter with a turned, off-center hopper on top that detracts from the look. A stand alone dial would have been better.\n\nAlso, with my old chopper I was accustomed to simply adding the beans I wanted to grind at that time, but that is harder to do with this one since you don't grind according to bean volume but rather according to number of cups you want to brew. It is not easy to add exactly the right amount. If less beans are added than what matches to the selected number of cups to brew, the grinder will finish with the beans and grind air for the remainder of the cycle, which is probably not good for it. The only other solution is to fill the bean hopper and permit your beans to sit in the non-airtight bin.\n\nWith respect to this \"cups\" measurement, most standard full size carafes are marked as having a 12 cup capacity, but this grinder is not on that same page. If you set the grinder for 12 cups it will damn near grind the whole hopper full of beans. After a few days of experimenting I settled on 5 cups to sufficiently provide for the 12 cup carafe.\n\nMoving on to the control which regulates the number of cups to make, this slider control has very fine detents which demark the number of cups to make. Sliding this right or left through the detents determines the volume of beans it will grind. But the detents are very fine and feeling/hearing each so you know where you are on the scale is not easy. Also, the scale is graduated with very small numbers and only about every 4th number is actually provided while the in between stops are denoted with just a line. The slider action is sloppy and clicking through the detents is mushy with lots of play. It is easy to stop on the wrong number of cups. A dial with crisp click-stop action would have been much preferred.\n\nThe collection cup which catches the ground beans does not pour well, making a mess each time it is emptied. Somehow it also generates a large amount of static which causes the grindings to cling inside the cup and fly off in various directions when the lid is removed. You will definitely need a coffee brush with this grinder. The grinding itself is quite loud and is an unpleasant noise. If you are grinding the night before, make sure no one is sleeping already. Finally, the unit is fully clothed in plastic which does not help the look or feel.\n\nYes, it does the job, but lots of missed opportunities in the design."

I loved that it was so easy to set whatever grind you want from fine to coarse and that you can fill it and walk away as it does its job. It beats holding down a button on my old blade grinder. My grinder arrived with a shattered reservoir even though the box was not damaged. I called Cuisinart and a new one came in a week. In the meantime my husband put a duct tape patch on the hole and it worked. There is a fine powder of grounds no matter what coarseness is chosen and one review said that it's actually not a burr grinder and that is why you get the static and powdered grinds. My beef with this grinder is that it lasted a total of 4 months before it crapped out. I won't be buying another like it."

I use it daily or get very cranky.\nThe grinder easily delivers fine or coarse ground coffee. Also, the setting for # of cups is perfect in my opinion. Set it to 8 cups for instance and pour 8 cups of water into the coffee maker = a perfect cup of coffee to my liking. The motor in this thing is a beast. It's noisy. There's a con I guess. This and my drip coffee maker make a -good- cup of coffee. When I'm in the mood for a -great- cup of coffee... nothing beats my conical pour over coffee dripper and my hand grinder. Coffee tastes like a 7/10 from the drip coffee maker but a 10/10 from the pour-over method. What does that have to do with this grinder review? Nothing. When I'm in my usual morning rush to get out the door this is the go-to coffee grinder for me."

Having the grinder over a year, customer support was not helpful. I wasn't trying to get something for free, I wanted to get a new burr wheel and was willing to buy it. I was told there was no support for the product or parts available.\n\nHere is a perfectly good product able to continue service with a bit of maintenance, left as a paperweight because of no support/parts or serviceable resources. The housing and motor are impeccable. The mechanics of this product, can go for years and years. Left for dead because of lack of a replaceable burr wheel. I bought a different brand with a replace-able burr wheel and am quite happy with it."

I only kept it for so long because my husband refused to let me get rid of it. The cup the ground coffee is deposited in after the beans are ground is awful. The hole in the back lets the ground coffee escape once it's removed from the grinder; the lid of the cup is not secured so, if you aren't careful, it falls off when you remove it, and the coffee grounds stuck on the lid spill everywhere. I hated this grinder, and I'm GLAD it died! Now I can get another one that, hopefully, is much better designed!"

Will probably just sell it and buy the Baratza grinder.\n\nGENERAL CONCLUSION:\nJust want a fresh cup of coffee when you stumble into the kitchen? Buy this. Want a refined brew that allows you to taste the subtle nuances and citrus notes of your carefully chosen, locally roasted beans? Don't buy this.\n\nDetailed Conclusion:\nThe average consumer who brews from a french press or an auto drip machine and doesn't really have refined coffee palate (no offense) will find this grinder suited to their needs just fine. I typically enjoy pour overs from my local specialty coffee shops, and bought this to start playing around on my own without dropping a fortune since I'm lazy and usually go out for a cup.\n\nI currently only own a french press and a drip maker, so I have never gone finer on this machine than a medium grind. The first thing I've noticed, is that while 100 times better than a blade grinder, it is still not as consistent a grind as I expected from a burr grinder. I would probably recommend using something like a Kruve sifter (which if you're that serious about coffee, why buy this to begin with) to filter out the inconsistent pieces. I have been wanting to buy a Kalita Wave, but due to the inconsistent grinds, I will probably buy a smaller manual grinder for that for now, but with my french press it tastes just fine.\n\nI will also note that if you are filling the hopper with only the exact amount of beans you are wanting to brew, it tends to throw the last few beans around since it doesn't have any weight to push it into the burrs. I realize this may be the main culprit of my inconsistent grinds. I like to store my beans in an airtight container, not the hopper, so this is another downside for those who carefully measure the weight of their beans for an individual brew. Again, this is better suited to someone who is doing a large batch of drip coffee. Would probably be really good for an office break room.\n\nIt is a VERY loud machine, so if you are a parent or have a roommate, I would hesitate to buy this product. I work night shift, so everyone is awake by the time I use it (much to the unspoken gratefulness of my apartment neighbors).\n\nOverall, this is a very consumer-grade grinder, if the price didn't already tell you that. Keurig, Mr. Coffee and French Pressers will enjoy this grinder due to its \"get the job done\" attitude and reliability at an affordable price. This is not the grinder for coffee snobs. Anything less than $100 will simply not be as refined as we need it to be. Eventually I will be upgrading to the Baratza Encore ($139 best price online)."

When you try to push off the grind with the brush, some inevitably scatters (I mean *flies*) from the bin, repelled by the charge. It is always creating a minor mess. I learned my lesson and I always put the bin in the sink before I dislodge the grinds off the sides into a single corner of the bin. Then I try to dump the grinds into a filter, but the powder always manages to escape in small amounts. This, IMO, is an example of a product that company executives should have been forced to use (under watchful eyes at the office) for a few months before signing off on the final product. The bin did NOT have to be designed from such a mess-making material."

We use it to grind single serving amounts (24 grams of coffee at a time) and not once has it ground all the beans. They fly out of the little hole where they're supposed to be getting ground and if you run it a few times, it's more likely to overheat than grind all the coffee. Thus, I now add a few extra beans as a sacrifice to this stupid machine. Once the grinding is \"done\" there are grinds everywhere surrounding it. They somehow fly out of the cracks between the plastic pieces. Annoying. And when you take the plastic box holding the ground coffee out to use, watch out or the static electricity will send half the amount of coffee flying all over the counter. We had static in our Krups grinder and thought it was a pain, but it was truly nothing compared to the Cuisinart. Only buy this if you don't care about cleaning up coffee every time you use it.

This grinder is fairly loud when in operation, and the only grinder I've used that isn't godawfully loud is the one attached to a $5K espresso machine, but this one is certainly not as loud as the mini grinder I use for spices. I'm pretty particular about appliances and tools, and this one does the job it is supposed to, and does it well. I use the grinder set to the finest setting, and it gives a consistent, fine-sand grind that makes a good cup of coffee every time. I've used this on a variety of organic beans, from hard, light roast morning blend beans all the way to the darkest and greasiest beans, and I get the same results every time, with one variation; the Jeremiah's Pick Blue Mountain Blend seems to grind even more finely than other beans (and it makes my favorite cup, too). When I remember to do it about once or twice a year, I throw professional grinder cleaner tablets through the grinder to un-grease and un-gunk it, and I think this may be why my machine is still going strong (knock wood). ***A warning: an employee did manage to burn out one of these grinders at the store by running four or five (or more?) hoppers of beans through the machine without allowing it to cool off in between. (To this day, I cannot fathom why that was even deemed necessary.) IMO, that is unreasonable use, especially for an appliance rated for home use.*** Overall, I recommend this grinder for the home coffee brewer, especially at Amazon prices. I've seen it priced at an even hundred, and that is ridiculous, considering other outlets don't offer the same level of customer service."

At least two teaspoons of your coffee will be turned into the finest dust you've ever seen and the static electricity generated from the grinding process along with the plastic bin will drive you mad. Why does it matter? First, you're wasting coffee. Secondly, if your grounds are all different sizes, the smaller grounds will overextract while the larger chunks will underextract. If you're going through the trouble of buying whole beans and grinding at home, you probably want the best tasting cup of coffee you can get. This grinder will not do that. You can see from the photos other people have posted that the grind comes out very uneven. Don't waste your money like I did. Buy the lowest end model Baratza and you won't be sorry."

            "reviewText": "First off, this isn't a top-of-the-line grinder. This is an upgrade from the more-common (and cheap) blade grinder that you're probably still using. And in comparison to that, it's a great upgrade. The grinds come out even, and the coarseness selector works well. I like to have a coarser grind for my pour-over, single-cup brews (less caffeine transfer == a more smooth cup of coffee), and a more fine-grain grind for drip (because I need all the caffeine I can get when I get up at 5am for my job).\n\nThe \"cup\" selector for the amount of grinds, however, is a little squirrely. I'm not sure if it is time based or what, but it seems pretty arbitrary as to how much coffee it will grind depending on the coarseness selected. This doesn't really bother me much, as I usually use a scale to weigh the grinds before brewing anyway (at least for single cups--for full pots, it's just the more the merrier).\n\nThe one place that this mill falls short is, as others have stated, in the ultra-fine grinding. Don't get this if you're looking for a grinder for espresso. I'm not much of an espresso aficionado, but I do have an AeroPress espresso maker that I like for americanos once in a while, and for that I still have to use the blade grinder (and yes, I know that supposedly \"burns the beans\" but go ahead and bite me, hipster). Not a dealbreaker, but good to know in advance.\n\nSo there you have it. It's good for brewed coffee, good for pour-over coffee, and lousy for espresso coffee. Make your purchase decision accordingly."

            "reviewText": "I bought this grinder about four years ago. It is inexpensive for a burr grinder, and it produces a much more uniform grind than the blade grinders. I like the fact that I can set the quantity and let the machine grind the beans while I fill the coffee maker with water and filter.\n\nThere are some issues, however:\n\nFirst, the grinder produces a fair amount of dust, particularly at fine grind settings. I bought this grinder in part to get rid of the \"mud\" at the bottom of my french press brew, but it still produces enough dust to leave a fair amount of \"mud.\" In addition, the dust accumulates at the opening to the grind chamber, and will ultimately block it completely. You have to clean out that opening with a small knife every couple weeks or so.\n\nSecond, the safety interlocks on the grinder can be finicky. Coffee gets into crevices around the back and bottom of the grind chamber, preventing it from seating by a fraction of an inch, and the interlock prevents the grinder from working. I almost threw a perfectly good machine away, thinking it was broken, and it just needed a meticulous cleaning.\n\nFinally, and most importantly, the grinder is not designed or built to last. The design puts a lot of stress on the feed tube of the bean chamber. After six months of use, my grinder developed spiral cracks on this tube; I was able to glue the cracks, and the grinder worked for another three years or so, but then the grinder plate on the bottom of the bean chamber became so worn that the screws came off, and the unit failed. I bought another bean chamber, but after I used it once, the grinder plate attached to the motor sheared off.\n\nIt took Cuisinart two weeks to inform me that they will not sell the grinder plate attached to the motor separately. When that piece breaks or wears out, the whole grinder has to be thrown away."

A stiff artist paint brush works great. People also have said that it doesn't grind coffee fine enough. I use strong espresso and french roast beans for my espresso machine and the grinds are as fine as they can be. It'll grind beans any way your coffee maker calls for, from very coarse to very fine.

            "reviewText": "I bought this grinder in 2007 and it finally just died on me yesterday. For the almost 8 years of faithful service, I'm giving it 5 stars. Some of the reviews I've read on here are accurate. For example, the container for the coffee grinder is made of plastic so you definitely get static every time you use the grinder. You have to tap the container lightly to get some of the fine grinds to settle down before opening the lid.\n\nWhich brings me to my next point that the grinds can be a little inconsistent. We mostly grind coffee for our french press, but after each grind, we'll get about 1/2-1 teaspoon of fine coffee powder. This is the stuff that works its way into our french pressed coffee only to end up at the bottom of our cup. It's also the stuff that clogged up our machine.\n\nWhich brings me to my next point, my machine finally died on me probably because I didn't clean it out, ever. I didn't know this until it died on me and I tried to open it up. Lesson: remove the hopper once in a while to clean out the burrs and clean the opening that feeds the ground coffee into the grind container. The fine coffee grind can build up and clog up the machine.\n\nSomething I like about this machine is that there is a \"stop\" button so you can stop the grinding process quickly at any point. On some other machines, I've read you have to twist the hopper which can mess up the machine.\n\nOverall, for your average, everyday coffee drinker who loves fresh ground coffee, this machine is perfect for the price point and performance. I would buy it again except my husband wants an even fancier coffee grinder now."

Not just tapping it out, I mean soap, water, drying, etc. It is the LAST THING WE WANT TO DO with bleary eyes in the morning\n4 - We thought we'd love how the coffee maker grinds it up for you seconds before it brews (AND WE DO) we just HATE THE MESS\n\nSo, we bought this machine yesterday. We may be a little prejudiced because of our intense hate (yep, strong word, HATE, but it fits) of cleaning out the grind chamber in the coffee maker, but this grinder works great. Simple to use, semi-quiet (the coffee maker we have sounds like an air raid siren or tornado alarm, and we are NOT kidding one bit. It freaks out our guests when they spend the night and we set it up to go off in the morning!), somewhat even grind (there is some dust, to be expected at this price point) and quick enough. Run down of some of my observations from playing with it this morning:\n\nPros\n- Can't beat the price for a burr grinder. The grind is far superior to a blade grinder. Save your blade grinder for spices and get this grinder.\n- Easy to use. Dial the grind setting, slide the switch to the number of cups you want to make and hit 'Start'.\n- EXCELLENT flavor extraction. We used about 30% less coffee to get the same flavor and strength. We couldn't believe it. I had to dump the first batch (we like our coffee strong) because it was too strong using the same amount of coffee grounds by volume.\n- Overall good product.\n\nCons\n- Static electricity is an issue but not a deal breaker for me. Give the chamber a quick tap on the sink bottom and most of the dust is gone. There is some residue but it would compromise less than 1/2 of 1% of the volume of the next grind if you total the weight in nangrams... I am semi-anal but if this bothers you, it really shouldn't.\n- Kinda tough to get 100% clean between grinds, but if you are looking at this machine and seriously considering it, you are not a coffee grinder snob and a tiny bit of yesterday's ground coffee in your grinder will not bug you one bit.\n\nOverall, I like it. Works good, less than $40 and the coffee flavor from our regular beans was superb. We used fewer beans with superior taste to the blade type grinder. The small issues with this machine far outweigh the great flavor and for the price, you just cannot beat it."

Espresso setting not even close to fine. Same bag of beans that tasted great in the last grinder tastes like heated water with this grinder. I wish I had the older version back. I pulled out my old blade grinder just to get a decent cup of coffee. I am going to return this one and get a different one to see if I just got a bad grinder. Just like the very first one seven years ago, maybe we just happened to get a bad one. That said, that very first one ground fantastically it just had a bad motor.

So that being said, here was the problem, not cleaning the build up of coffee beneath the burr and shoot. If you do it with every bag of beans then it will last and produce a great flavored coffee, once you determine the grind that works best for the type of coffee maker you use. Between the first and second one, I tried another brand. It was messy and hard to clean which is absolutely necessary with oily bean! I used it one month and then I went back to this model again. I have now had it about 5 years and still happy with it. Yes, there is a little dust. The mess mentioned on the counter, I don't have that unless I have gotten lazy about cleaning it! I also use it to grind coffee for my expresso machine, and French press. The thing that took me a few years to fugure out and reading the book that came with my expresso machine, is you can buy the most expensive equipment out there, but don't expect the first cup of coffee to taste like you get from your favorite barrista. You have to find the grind than works with your coffee equipment and your taste. AND clean your grinder!\n\nUPDATE 3/15/2018...I wrote the review above at least 4yrs. ago about the 2nd DM-8 I was using. Well that coffee grinder just died after being used daily about 9 yrs. In this day and age that is a miracle, especially since it did not cost a fortune. Cleaning it regularly was the Key! I use a dental hygienist tool & brush and remove all oily built up dust under the burr and around and under where the bean holder screws to grinder and also the shoot. I am sure if we had taken it apart over the year as the above reviewer suggusted we might have gotten more years of service out of it!"

Seriously, there couldn't have been more grounds and powder stuck to the sides of the container. I had it set for medium grind and the lowest cup setting for just a few cups and afterward, I'm sure there was at least a tablespoon of grounds and dust stuck all over the sides...hate to think of the amount that would be there when using it to capacity. Please don't waste your money\n\nUPDATE: another user let me know that mine was probably missing the plastic cover for the chamber. It's looks like that may have been the case...mine was missing something. May be a good grinder with that in place. Make sure that's there when you open the box."

There's a slider to set length of time of grind that doesn't move when set. So every day I just hit the start button and walk out of the kitchen. You'll know when it's done!\n2. When I take the little hopper out with the finished ground coffee, I put my thumb over the opening on the hopper. Then I tap the hopper on the counter a couple times and take the top off to unleash the ground coffee. I tap this into a Tupperware cup, use what I want and put the top on the Tupperware. I finish the ground coffee every day.\nAt found a small, round brush designed to brush coffee out of your grinder at SBUX years ago. I use that to clean the hopper when there's too much coffee built up. I don't have a bad dust problem."

Tired of the tedium of major cleanups every day, we decided get rid of our Capresso and try this Cuisinart instead. To our relief, this product has no static charge problem at all [see UPDATE below for more on this]. Like the others, its collector is plastic, so I have no idea why it spares us the messes that others produced, but we're pleased with the outcome. We use a drip coffee maker, and the \"fine\" setting on this grinder works well for that purpose.\n\nInterestingly, some other reviews of this grinder complain about the very static charge issue that we experienced with other brands, but not with the Cuisinart. Maybe it depends on the environment where the product is being used.\n\nUPDATE: After further experience with this grinder, we began to have some problems with static electricity, although nothing as bad as we had experienced with our Capresso. But we have now changed from the Cuisinart to a Bodum (Bodum Bistro Electric Burr Coffee Grinder, Black), which uses a glass container (rather than plastic) to receive the grounds. That seems to make all the difference. So far, the Bodum has been entirely immune to static issues."

You have to manually clean it out. The grinder wheel is behind this shoot and it can turn as the compacted coffee is dug out (I use a thin wooden skewer). I have typically cleaned this out about 3 times during my year of using this grinder. Twice now after the third time the grinder failed to turn on. Pressing the power bar or trying to get the safety shutoff buttons realigned doesn't do anything. I even tried a couple of electrical hacks recommended on a some DIY sites. The grinder remained dead.\n\nThis grinder may be priced well but it's still a lot of money to spend on a grinder that'll only last a year. I'm sure that Cuisinart is aware of this design flaw but has chosen not to fix it since it still sells a lot of these.\n\nUntil I come across a better but affordable burr grinder I'm back to using a blade grinder.

Since the internal fuse hadn't blown and the switches were still working, I suspect that friction from the accumulated coffee caused the motor to draw excessive current, overloading and burning out the circuitry.\n\nIf you already own this model, periodically clean out the chute where the coffee exits the burr mechanism.

This grinder is not meant for espresso, or for fanatical connoisseurs:\n\nWhile this is only slightly above the bottom price rung for burr grinders, it's a huge step above even the best BLADE grinders. For people who want a \"mostly\" consistent grind (which you'd never come close to with a blade grinder) and an overall better taste due to the milling process, this is a great place to start. You're never going to get 100% consistent grinds without, first of all, using a conical grinder (these lower end ones use grinding wheels instead of cones), and secondly getting something that costs about 5-6 times as much as this one. If you're willing to accept 5% lower grind quality, and want to pay 1/5 or 1/6 as much as a high-end grinder, this is the grinder for you.\n\nThe build quality is excellent compared to others in the same price range, or in many cases higher priced models. It's very solidly built and the feature-set is great. The one-button grind is my favorite feature. Walk into the kitchen, push the button, wait half a minute, and you're good to go. The bin for holding beans is much larger than most of the competition as well. They say it holds 1/2 lb, but it actually holds 3/4 lb.\n\nI've had one other, cheap burr grinder, and it didn't come anywhere close to this one. I'd buy this one again in a heart beat."

It got the job done for $50 with a grind that was not terribly consistent but OK. It's near impossible to use without making a mess due to both how much fine coffee dust it produces as well as poor ergonomics. You will also have to clean it regularly if you don't want to infect your fresh coffee with the stale fine coffee grinds that build up on the \"exhaust port\". It also has no insulation so it IS loud. I probably would have given it a 3-3.5 star based on how well it works as a product and the price point.\n\nThe reason for the 1 star review is 2 fold. First, the motor died after an estimated 100 uses, which is unacceptable to say the least. Even worse than that however, is my experience with Cuisinart. As with so many other reviewers they seemed less than concerned both times I called. On both customer service calls the first thing they wanted was a receipt (I bought mine through Bed Bath & Beyond I believe) to prove that it was bought within the 18 month warranty period, which is of course their right to do. Unfortunately, even if/when I do find that, I will have to pay ~$10 to send them them the old one before they will send the replacement that will also charge me $10 for shipping. So on top of all the hassle so far, Cuisinart wants me to pay nearly half the original price of the unit to have it replaced under warranty and go without the grinder for likely 2 weeks or more on top of the week+ I've already been without it before having time to address it. Save yourself the hassle.\n\nI also encourage anyone considering this product to look at the review distribution. It currently has 43% 5-star and 18% 1 star which are both numbers that would concern me. I would not have bought this originally purchased if I saw that first, but I thought Cuisinart was a good company. I didn't go through them all but I have not seen a single response from Cuisinart on any of the complaints. From my experience it's clear that Cuisinart is a company that does not care about it's customers or stand by it's products. I recommend taking your business elsewhere. I will be doing so from now on."

            "reviewText": "I bought this and was thrilled to finally have a burr grinder. The burr style grinders are the absolute best for grinding coffee because they can grind to a range of very consistent coarseness settings.\n\nThe good: This is a bur grinder and can handle a lot of coffee, more than most coffee brewers and presses can brew at once. It has a range of coarseness settings from espresso and Turkish all the way to french press. The grind is quite consistent as all proper burr grinders should be.\n\nThe bad: Well first of all it's extremely noisy, which is just not Cuisinart's style! That I can live with though.\nSecondly the more coffee you grind, the more of a mess you make because the grind hopper isn't the best design. It's deep and plastic which makes a huge static problem throwing grinds everywhere as soon as you open it, and it's difficult to empty if you're not going to just dump everything you've ground straight out into a waiting vessel. This design makes it very hard to pour freshly ground coffee anywhere. All of this I've chosen to just deal with.\nThird, It has a selector which times the grinder and automatically shuts it off to grind certain amounts of coffee so that you can leave all your whole beans in the hopper and grind exactly what you need when you need it. The settings would be nice and convenient if they weren't uselessly inaccurate. I still end up scooping exactly what I need and never leaving beans in the hopper.\n\nBut worst of all, the noise is caused by high vibration which can be expected from burr grinders. What should not be expected is that over 5 or 6 months of very light use (once a week or less) the vibration has caused all of the plastic around the inside of the burr wheels to fracture and break apart. So far the grinder still operates as expected, but every time I take it apart to clean it, more plastic has chipped away. I expect the entire unit will be completely useless soon.\n\nI am hopping that all of these problems are merely a defect in this individual unit. I may buy another soon but will probably end up getting a completely different brand with a much better engineered design."

Easier to use than the blade grinder which I had to scrape some of the grind out when through.\n\nDurability - can not answer because it is new. But warranty is 18 months and you know I have learned a little secret the longer the warranty the longer it should last and most grinders have a one year warranty.

That's 365 minutes a year, and over 700 minutes over the life of the machine. That's 12 hours of time not spend with drudgery, at $2/hour. Not bad."

You can use a lot of force to tamp down the stuff the fine setting produces and get a semi-drinkable cup of espresso, but you're never going to get beyond turd polishing with this machine. You're better off saving up for a few more weeks and getting something more expensive if you're going to make espresso.\n\nFor other uses, it would probably be adequate, but if you don't really care about grind quality, anyone can get crappy grinds from the local supermarket."

I started grinding only enough for a pot and left the beans in the mill. After a few uses, the opening to the container would clog. Now I am grinding about a half pound at a time and putting into an air tight container, then I clean up enough to grind a half pound of a different roast. I accept that I'm going to have a mess at the end, so I prepare an area beforehand and work on several paper towels so I can just pitch them out. My biggest problem is that I like a coarse grind and this thing doesn't grind coarse enough for me. It's got a gazillion grind settings, but I don't see a whole lot of difference in them. But I think it is tons better than the 'blade' style mills."

Our grinder fell off the counter and top hopper cracked at the internal screw threads. I was easily able to order a replacement. This helped extend the life of the grinder.\nThe reason that I am giving this model only 3 stars is that compared to a top-end grinder it doesn't have a consistent grind. There is always some fine powder after every grind, even coarse grind."

I was able to do so with the purchase of my elegantly styled, Burr grinder. I was first sold on the 18-position grind selector. Not all mornings are created equal, and either is my desire for the strength of my coffee. Plus, I drink coffee all day long, and different times of day require different strengths of coffee. I put a lot of effort into finding the flavor in my coffee beans, and I don\u2019t want it diminished by my grinder. I\u2019ve owed a lessor quality grinder and besides the fact that they have not lasted, they pulverize my coffee beans into something resembling my bowling alley coffee shop\u2019s coffee. My husband and I are the usual coffee drinkers in our home, but when it comes to offering others coffee, the slide dial comes in handy. For my book club I made 3 different types of beans using the setting for 6 cups. We had a taste test, but what I heard most was how delicious my coffee was. Another feature I enjoy is when I know I\u2019ll be drinking a lot of coffee all day; I simply fill the plastic basket that sits atop the grinder which is enough for a few pots of coffee."

You can adjust the dial to just the amount of coffee you need. You'll get the hang of the slider dial with a few pots. Best to grind too little, and have to grind a little more, than to grind more than you need for the pot you are making now.\n\nHowever, I use flavored coffees, and the the plastic hopper is becoming discolored. The cup where the coffee is dispensed is worse. The plastic towards the top and particularly in the corners - including the lid is completely milky white. No amount of washing will take that away - I've tried. You can feel it has an etched feeling. This is also happening on the bottom as well.\n\nNote: this is not hampering the grinder's performance in any way; it's just a little ugly to see. It looks like maybe, over extended time. the integrity of the plastic might be compromised. And the way the unit is designed, I can't see anything else fitting in there. Still knowing this I would still buy the grinder again.\n\nIt does make an loud almighty grinding sound (I can't hear the tea kettle's whistle over it) and comes to a squeaky screeching halt, but for what awaits me in that cup, I certainly don't mind."

It grinds alright, but produces quite a bit of coffee bean dust, which finds its way easily into the bottom of our coffee pot. I am sure a paper filter would solve this problem, but we use a metal re-usable filter, so we'll have to deal with it.\n\nIt is LOUD. I don't use it after 8pm because I feel bad for the upstairs neighbor. I mean, it's not THAT loud, but it's loud at night when people are tying to sleep, ya know? I also don't use it in the morning. Same problem.\n\nI do like the container that the ground coffee deposits into. It's very well contained... until you open it, and coffee dust spills on your counter. Just open it over the sink and you'll be fine. But otherwise, while it's grinding nothing escapes, and I leave the unused ground coffee in the container for a few days and it seems to stay fairly fresh.\n\nThe machine is about twice the size I think is necessary for the average person or couple, but if you're going to make plenty of coffee and need to grind plenty of beans, this machine's capacity is great. It IS as tall as my actual coffee maker, though. And to be honest, I like the settings, even though I make my coffee a little less strong. So I just use a little less coffee than the machine seems to think I need. (It supposedly times it to grind for 4, 8, etc etc cups of coffee.)"

It has been very reliable.\n\nThe two shortcomings of this machine have been noted by other reviewers. They should have used glass for the ground coffee receiver to avoid the static cling, and there is some amount of basically unusable powder produced with each grind.\n\nThese shortcomings can be considered as one negative effect: some amount of your coffee is wasted, either as unusable powder, or clinging to the plastic container. At most maybe 5% of your coffee might be wasted this way.\n\nDo the math. At $8/pound, 5% loss is 40 cents lost per pound. To get a really top quality machine that avoids these problems, you might expect to pay $300 more than for this machine. At 40 cents a pound of lost coffee that might be avoided by the more expensive machine, you would have to grind about 750 pounds of coffee to break even. So to me, this is a no-brainer.\n\nIMO, it makes no sense to compare this grinder with some $500 grinder. Compare this machine to others in its price range, and I think you will see that this machine comes up very near, if not at, the top."

With the coarse grind setting for the french press, this grinder produces lots of fines that can end up in your cup--like drinking sand.

The output container requires you scrape the grinds and residue from it but that's the price of a classy looking design I guess.\n\nThe problem is that about 3 months ago, the automatic grind switch stopped working, requiring that we stand there and hold the 'on' switch long enough to get the quantity of grounds we needed. Then, about a month ago, even that stopped working.\n\nEverything about this unit is heavy duty and it hurts me to throw away a perfectly good coffee grinder just because the switch is non-replaceable (and obviously cheap) but there you go...we are a throwaway society because our manufacturers try to save 3 cents on a switch...\n\nNo way I would buy this unit again, because there is no way to get instructions or spare parts for it from the manufacturer.

I used a coarse grind, which fell to the bottom of the collector, but a massive clump of super fine dust collected against the top of the collector. If I could scoop that out before it fell, I got less sediment, but it usually fell off when I removed the collector from the grinder. So this grinder was good enough to get me to make coffee, but not good enough to make me entirely happy with that coffee. I looked for a better model.\n\nYesterday I received a Bodum Bistro and made my first pot this morning. The different is significant. No dust from the Bodum, and much more flavor from the same beans and preparation. The Bodum is about $30 more expensive, but worth every cent.\n\nSummary: It's tempting to pick this up for cheap, but if you're anything like me, you'll want something a little better."

Almost everyone has mentioned the static, but let me expand a little: When you take the lid off the grinding chamber, the coffee grounds actually fly all over the place due to the static. You start to realize that the plastic grinding chamber apparently is statically charged, and the coffee grounds seem to magnetically repel the plastic chamber, and then when you touch the unit you provide a path for the static to discharge, and grounds tend to go all over the counter/floor/etc. I have had several other grinders and several with plastic chambers, but have never seen any with so much static or so much mess!\n2) Clogged discharge chute: I have owned my grinder about three months and use it every morning, and about 5 times now have had to take it all appart when it stopped working due to grounds clogging the discharge chute. This causes the unit to seem like it is broken, until you take it all apart and clean it and un-clog it. And if you keep trying to grind in this condition, it quickly overheats and starts smoking!\n\nOverall, like I said, it does do a good job grinding and it looks nice, and seems like a pretty good deal for the cost, but if you can afford to look for one without the draw backs above you might want to keep looking. So even though the grinder looks nice and grinds well, the mess is an every day annoyance you will be stuck with."

The beans and the finer grind collect up quite quickly and clog up both where the beans go down into the burr, and also where the grinds pour out. Cleaning creates a giant mess. The alternative is that the beans will not go down to the burr to grind and we have to continually smack the top of the hopper to get the beans to go down.\n\nSo imagine, every time you want coffee, not only is there the noise of the machine, which I could deal with because I have never heard a quiet grinder, but the beans are not going through the machine so we are also running over to smack on the top of the hopper. It makes for an altogether violent coffee grinding experience. My husband is practically apoplectic everytime the thing starts to choke up again.\n\nI can't recommend this grinder, esp. if you like darker coffee shop roasts (or even sumatra) and often grind for cone or use other finer grinds."

The grinder works well for brewed coffee applications, and I knew the price dictated that it would not be the best option for espresso makers. If you are a true espresso aficionado, you know that you can not get a decent grinder for that type of application for much less than $100. If you can, you need to post that in your review. Second, plastic + grinding process = static cling for coffee grinds. There isn't a way around it unless you eliminate the plastic, which again dictates a higher priced product. I know of no sub-fifty dollar option that does not utilize plastic as the primary housing component. Further, a 1\" paint brush kept near your coffee making area will alleviate the problem. I have used this grinder almost every morning for three months now and have yet to experience the \"no grinds in the receptacle\" problem, I can't figure out how that happens. The noise is acceptable for a hard working piece of equipment. My son has a Barista unit, priced similarly, that makes only slightly less noise and the receptacle does not lock into place as on the Cuisinart, so if you forget to hold it into place with your hand or some weighted object, you get grounds all over the counter. So if you're looking for a grinder to provide coffee grounds for brewed coffee, the DBM-8 represents one of the best values on the market. If you are wanting espresso grade grounds, look elsewhere."

Since I bought this, it has consistently made a great cup of coffee every time.\n\nMy only complaint (there is always one of course), is that like other people have said, it always grinds a teaspoon of super fine grinds into the container no matter what setting you put it on. This isn't a big issue though as they collect right at the top of the container in a little pile that sticks to itself (coffee is oily ya know). I do French Press, so it means I need to swipe this out before I make my brew, otherwise I get extra grit in my coffee. This takes a whopping 5 seconds out of my day, and while I wish I didn't have to do it, I need only point out that this nice little grinder was only $39. It's a great deal and a great first step up from the push button thermos grinder."

No mess, no cleanup, and I don't use a measuring scoop any more.\n\nIf this thing holds up over time (and I know that some of the reviewers have had trouble with failures), it is a great value. I'm already addicted to it... I never thought someone could make grinding your own beans EASIER than buying them already ground. I'm pretty lazy, and I usually don't dump out old coffee until I'm ready to make the next pot. If you hit the button first, then start rinsing your pot out, filter, etc, it has the coffee ready and measured for you by the time your done! It actually makes my routine FASTER!\n\nOn the loudness--It would probably wake up a light sleeper because it is about as loud as making a margarita in a cheap blender. However, mine does not have a high pitch, and I don't mind the sound to have fresh ground beans. For 30 bucks, what do you want?

Second, the plastic parts are fitted together very precisely and if any joint gets just a little bit clogged with coffee grains, the device won't work. I've gotten used to this problem. Third, the calibrations seem somewhat off. For example, if set it for four cups, it will grind enough coffee to easily make 8 cups of rich coffee.

The main issue I have, is that although the grind is consistent, this coffee \"dust\" sticks to the sides after grinding. Regardless of what grind size you set on the machine, you will always get this extremely fine dust forming on the sides and close to the top. If using a french press, you will need to scoop these chunks of dust off, as they may seep through the metal filter (they conveniently clump up, so they are easy to separate from the main grounds). This is not a huge issue, and pretty easy to deal with. Also, everything sticks to the sides of the plastic container, making grinds extremely hard to get out. However, I made a ghetto contraption to fix this. I put plastic wrap on the inside of the plastic container to form a bag, where all of the grounds pooled to the center. I had no sticking issues, and it fixed the problem perfectly. I will warn that this grinder is very, VERY messy if this bag modification is not performed. Grounds will end up in random places on your counter. Once again, it is a great bargain for an electric coffee grinder, but it is not going to be nearly at the level of $100 plus grinders. Also, the finest grind might not be fine enough for espresso makers. If you are shelling out the cash for a good espresso maker, you should probably shell out the cash for a good grinder, or at least buy a hand grinder."

I've had this machine for about two months now, and I like it.\nI do have a couple of issues:\n1) Static cling: The plastic cup that catches the grinds builds up a static charge. when you pull it off the machine you might get fine grinds shooting out of the opening of the closed jar onto the counter. When you take the lid off the jar, it will definitely shoot grinds into the air. I don't know if that is an issue with burr grinders in general, but it is annoying. I open it over the sink to avoid as much mess as possible. I don't think glass would avoid the issue either. I think a metal grounding wire would have to be built into the container to avoid the buildup of static completely.\n2) One good thing about a blade grinder is that you can measure exactly how much coffee you want to grind. I don't like whole-beans sitting in the hopper day after day because they dry out very quickly. This machine has a switch to choose the amount of coffee to be ground, and i think it runs on a timer although i haven't tested it. It does seem to be accurate and precise IF the hopper contains more beans than you plan to grind. If you measure just the amount of beans you want to grind, they tend be bounce around in the hopper. If the beans are bouncing around in the hopper, they probably aren't going into the grinder. You need more beans in the hopper than you plan to grind, so the excess will push the beans down onto the grinder.\n\nOther notes:\nA) I used to clean my blade grinder using a bit of uncooked white rice. Simply place it in the grinder and buzz it for a few seconds. Wipe out the dust, and viola, the grinder looked brand new every time. I have not attempted that technique yet, but I wonder if that would work for a burr grinder as well. In fact, I have not cleaned my machine at all in the two months of i've been using it (once daily, 8 cups, medium grind btw).\nB) It is a bit loud, but apparently all burr grinders are loud, and this one is about average.\nC) I do like using the machine. I've been getting good tasting results with my drip coffee maker. The grind is consistent which is the bottom line for a burr grinder."

It would spontaneously start without me even being in the room. At first, it would grind for the amount of time set on the selection slider and stop. A week or so ago, it started spontaneously, emptied the bin and kept running. I could only stop it by unplugging it. I plugged it back in and it stayed off until I left the room, when it did it again. I consider this a safety problem. What would have happened if I was not at home when it started to run spontaneously and did not stop. I am concerned that it could have overheated and started a fire.\n\nWell, now, I don't have to worry about that problem anymore because it flat out died.

It works OK but has a few very annoying characteristics that I just can't see past:\n\n1. Probably the most important feature of all is uniformity of grind. I use the coursest setting for french press coffee prepartion but this grinder still produces a lot of powder - there simply is no way around it. It is also very messy because of this. My counter tops are light and I cannot make coffee without making a mess - it is impossible. Just the act of removing and replacing the recieving container dumps powder everywhere.\n\n2. Too much plastic - if the recieving container were made of glass the coffee would not cling to it. The faux stainless plastic doesn't clean or shine very easily and should be used by law enforcement to record fingerprints.\n\n3. This is nitpicking I know but I'd like to be able to remove and replace the coffee bean hopper without spilling beans everywhere. In fact, having two hoppers that are interchangeable would be even better - there should be some sort of stopper in the bottom that is only oppened when the grinding begins."

            "reviewText": "Asked for a burr grinder for Christmas, as an upgrade for my blade grinder. It's definitely meeting that need, as it grinds much more consistently than a blade grinder, and at a decent price for an entry level electric/auto burr grinder. That said, I have two main complaints about this grinder:\n1) The plastic bin that holds the ground coffee is just a bad design all the way around. The small opening is prone to clog if you don't keep it clean, and it's messy, especially on the finer grind settings. It holds just enough static electricity that the coffee clings to the sides, and so you have to make sure to cover the hole when tapping it on the counter to get the coffee off the sides, and when you are trying to pour the ground coffee out into your maker you're likely to end up with some on the counter, because even if you try to use the corners as a way to direct the coffee, some still clings to the bottom and falls out as you upend the container.\n2) There needs to be a pulse setting for the grind. The pre-defined increments aren't granular enough, and so if you need \"just a little more\" coffee than the 4 cup setting, but less than the 6 cup setting (i.e. if you measure by weight), you may have some trouble. Otherwise, you end up having to measure the unground beans and add the right amount every time (so that it grinds 'til it runs out of beans), which sort of makes the hopper less useful.\n\nI think the sweet spot for this grinder is for someone who wants to have consistent freshly ground coffee for drip coffee makers or a French Press, as it does volume and coarser grinds well. I use an Aeropress for my usual coffee maker, and while this grinder works for that application, it's definitely not the best choice. If you're looking for something affordable and low-volume that handles finer grinds better and don't mind a little manual labor, search for ceramic burr grinder and go with the Kyocera or Hario hand crank models."

Even at its finest setting, it produces coffee bean chunks that vary from drip-grade coarse to not-so-fine. If you've got an espresso machine that won't give you that crema unless you feed it consistently finely ground coffee, you'll be disappointed with this grinder. Your espresso machine will blow water through the coarse bits and give you 15-second weak shots. On the other hand, if you need a grinder for drip/filter or French press coffee, this grinder will probably satisfy you since that equipment isn't nearly as \"picky\" as espresso machines are."

It has worked excellently, consistently, for seven years now. The grind adjustment provides a coarse grind that is just right for a french press. I came across another burr grinder with a grind adjustment option, the Krups GVX2 at a second hand store for five dollars, it looked hardly used and I bought it as a back up in case this one ever died. The Krups does not provide a truly coarse grind like this cusinart does but the cuisinart does not provide the talcum like fine grind that the Krups does. For me this is fine as I need the coarser grind for a french press. I only grind one or two cups of coffee at a time so I have never overtaxed the motor. It is as good now as it was when I bought it. The one problem I had was that a tab on the bottom of the grind chamber broke off. That tab was necessary for this to operate as it is part of a safety mechanism. It engages a switch when the grind chamber is in place. Since the machine will only grind when that grind chamber is in place there is no danger of spraying coffee grinds over the room. It was easy enough to buy a replacement chamber from cuisinart. If you are going to make expresso, I would recommend something that grinds fine such as the Krups, for everything else this grinder works great."

One cannot empty the finished ground coffee directly into the coffee maker's basket as the basket is square and large too big so grinds goes everywhere. An alternative of using the measuring spoon to get coffee grinds out of the square bend is, well you know, it doesn't work. The good news it that the grind setting works.\n\nSummary: the grinder should have been designed so the coffee beans could fall freely in the to grinder. If a lid is needed, it should be designed so coffee would not stick to it as it does now with the groves around the sides, maybe with a tap and with easy opening. The bend should be round and smaller than the coffee maker filter for easy empting."

You select how many cups worth of grounds you need with the slider switch and then push the start button. After a certain amount of time determined by the slider switch position, the machine stops automatically. Unfortunately, ours started automatically at 2:30 AM a few weeks ago, which was truly hair-raising, since the grinder is pretty loud. Our solution was to make do by moving the slider to \"OFF\" after grinding, which worked well for a while.\n\nHowever, one of us didn't move the slider to \"OFF\" after grinding a few days ago. We later noticed the bean hopper was empty and the grounds canister was very full, so we deduced that it had started itself again and ground all the beans that were there. Today we tried to grind some more and it failed to operate. I took it apart to investigate and discovered that the motor is fried. It must have run until it burned itself up.\n\nIf the grinder had a simple on-off switch, this would not have happened. Cuisinart food processors are made this way.

The quantity selector is not granular... in other words, there is nothing between 0 cups and 4 cups. I only have time for a single cup during the week (really equals a \"2 cup\" setting if it had one). The plastic capture bin is all static! The grounds adhere to the sides, and then when I try and pour the grounds into my coffee maker, they go all over the place! I hate it so much, I'm just going to just throw the thing out after 2 weeks and go back to my beloved Capresso, which is more expensive, but has NONE of the faults I've described here."

Blade grinders to grind up all the beans completely and burn the beans up. This burr grinder is excellent. I adjust the grind to my liking and away I go. Excellent fresh coffee every morning. The only down side is it's very noisy compared to a blade grinder. It's still so much better I deal with the noise and Cuisinart has never failed me. Down the road after years of use on my 2nd grinder, I'll still look for this one to buy again. No 5 stars due to noise."

When I did so however, the bean hopper had some condensation at the bottom and the grinder would not work until that dried itself out (a couple of days later). In addition, the plastic grind chamber came out of the dishwasher etched -- it looks dirty. After only two months, I ordered a replacement grinder chamber and will hand wash only now. As for the bean hopper, I will wipe clean from now on."

Its grind is inconsistent. You can hear a period of a second or two when no beans at all are between the burrs. It clogs easily, even when grinding at the coarse setting. It's difficult to clean the recessed area below the lower burr. The ground coffee receptacle has a lid on that's difficult to remove \u2014 the last thing you want when dealing with something that's full of fine particles. The square shape of the receptacle, combined with the presence of a smallish square hole in the side through which the grounds are deposited makes for difficult removal of statically charged grounds.\n\nBy comparison, the Capresso is quiet, its conical burr grinds consistently with less static charge, it's easy to clean, doesn't clog, and has a well-shaped basket.\n\nStay away from the Cuisinart."

Set the dial to the number of cups you intend to brew and it will grind the appropriate amount of grounds. This is a positive feature and was the reason that I chose to keep the grinder instead of returning it to the store.\n\nThe grinder worked very well for about 3 months (long enough for the return policy to expire) and then started to die. At first, every few times you pressed the grind button it would do nothing. Sooner or later it would finally start grinding. After a while, the machine stopped grinding all together. It is now dead and sitting in a cupboard.\n\nI admit, I did not bother with the warranty, at this point I don't care as I now use a blade grinder.\n\nI do not recommend this product even though I would normally recommend Cuisinart products."

Each one worked great until one day it just quit working. My husband took the last one apart hoping he could fix it however he found that the inside was all corroded, and there were a couple screws that seemed to belong nowhere. I think that after the 4th grinder, it's safe to say that Cuisinart may need to go back and do some fine tuning on this one, some think this is too loud, but most electric grinders are, and the noise doesn't last long. Still, I wouldn't recommend this grinder just because they just don't seem to last very long, and we only use ours once each day in the morning, and that's it!"

It takes up very little room on the counter. Easy to fill and empty. Stays clean with a few whisks of a rounded brush I got years ago at Starbucks. The best is that we have never had such consistently good coffee. Our coffee is good every day. We use a variety of beans from a local roaster and from Gevalia. Some oily. Some dry. In the past we had good days and so-so days with the same beans and assumed it was the amount of coffee we ground, the inconsistent grinding of our blade grinder, water temperature, etc. No more. With this grinder it's great coffee every day. I'm going to look it over and see if I have build up, though. Too many reports here of burnt out motors. So far, so very good. I recommend it highly."

            "reviewText": "Back around the year 2004, a hurricane hit my area and I lost power for 8 days. My blade grinder was useless to me, so I did the best I could with a bag of coffee beans, a hammer, and a 9\" chef's knife. After that experience, I purchased a hand cranked, conical burr grinder made in Germany. The coffee tasted so much better, I ditched the blade grinder.\n\nNow 8 years of hand grinding has become kind of a grind (sorry!), so I decided to get an electric burr grinder. I settled on the Cuisinart since a friend of mine recommended it. But there were issues right from the start, and these stem from the product's design.\n\nFirst of all, this machine is a burr grinder, not a conical burr grinder. This means that gravity alone won't get the grinds out of the burrs, the burr wheel needs to spin at high speed to fling the grinds out of the burr wheel. The result?\n\n*The brew came out more bitter using this machine; I grind medium to coarse for drip and sometimes pressed coffee.\n*Inconsistent particle size; there is more dust than with the conical burr, which probably explains the bitterness due to over extraction of the dust.\n*Overheated particle; spinning the grinder so fast to fling out the product puts way too much mechanical energy into shearing the beans. The energy is imparted to the flake / ground / particle as heat, which alters the flavor in the grind. Not good to re-roast the coffee!\n*Noise!!! My lawn mower makes less noise than this grinder.\n\nSo, just three weeks into using this machine, it finally just stopped and wouldn't start, not even after cleaning. What a relief! The folks at BB&B were good about taking it back.\n\nNow I'm on the hunt for an electric conical burr grinder with a reduction gear. Slow grinding is important. Consistent particle size is important. Yes, they cost a little more, but for the price of a couple of bags of coffee, you can get a machine that gives you better flavor out of your beans. I will never consider a flat burr grinder again; either they grind slowly and you have a lot of grinds left in the burr wheels and delivery chute that get stale and go into your next pot, or they run too fast and get hot and dusty.\n\nNow, the noise is gone, I have great tasting coffee, and I'm ready for the next hurricane. (I'm keeping the hand crank.)"

The purpose of buying a more expensive burr grinder is to get a more uniform, consistent grind. This product will not provide that. With every grind, there was really fine powder and coarse grounds at the same time. A really good burr grinder will have solid metal burrs doing the grinding. This has two thin metal plates attached to plastic pieces. If you want a good burr grinder, go with a Baratza. If price is a concern, I have also had luck with Capresso 560.01 Infinity Burr Grinder, which is less expensive than most."

After googling around I found that these units have two safety switches - one on the hopper and one on the output bin so that it won't operate if these are not in place. Seems like the switches they use are junk and go bad pretty easily. Took mine apart (because who has time to try to replace under warranty - I NEED my coffee now!) and found that the safety switch on the hopper was faulty. Easy solution was to take it out of the circuit so it is always \"on\".\n\nPut it back together and it works! Made a pot of coffee and could move on with my life. Today it didn't want to run again.

I could hear the motor start and then quickly stop so I asked Mr. Grampy Fixit to take a look.\n\nThe bottom line that he learned is that the circuit board has too much on it. Electrical power gets to the circuit board, but because there are many electrical connective parts and at least one is not working, power gets no further. Cuisinart used to be an assurance of a long-lasting quality product, bought my first Cuisinart processor in 1974 and it lasted around 20 years. I think it was a French product made in France.

Only now am I investing in an expensive Gaggia 8002 MDF and not because the Cuisinart has failed but, because I will need a better grinder to make true expresso. The Cuisinart has performed beautifully from rather coarse grinds for French pressing to medium for drip and fine for Moka pot. I have never taken it apart to clean the burrs although I probably should. The grinder which was an upgrade from a blade unit has delivered my money's worth over the years."

It serves my needs quite well, especially for the price and I keep it clearned up...about once a week I unscrew the hopper and brush all of that stuff out and turn it upside down and tap, and also brush out the shoot. Takes maybe three minutes....big deal. Also, the static thing doesn't bother me, as those would have been fines left in my french press coffee. A little bit makes for richer coffee but if it weren't for them sticking to the side and being easy to brush off I'd probably have somewhat sludgy coffee."

However, it WILL NOT grind fine enough for any espresso machine. Worse, its distribution of particle size is poor, as much dusting occurs due to the integral high speed blade. Thus it's very noisy, heating beans somewhat, like a cheap blade, and also deceptively slow.\nThe hopper design is a saving grace, but the receiver bin is awkward to load and fragile.\nUse is therefore restricted to less-critical pour-over methods where uniform particle size isn't as necessary for decent extraction. (Therefore not so good for presses, either.)\nI bought three of these, but the two unused ones are going back, as it's not really better than a $20 blade grinder."

Maybe I'm blind. I also don't like that the beans get stuck in the blade area and it is hard to clean that part of the unit.\n\nCostco has stopped carrying it so they just gave me my money back.

I usually brew with a french press and more recently, a Chemex. I've consistently made coffee with this grinder exclusively and it has met my expectations as a quality entry-level grinder.\n\nI have recently been becoming more educated about quality coffee and more precise equipment. That being said there are some parts that are a bit lacking in the DBM-8. For one, this machine produces a high amount of 'fines' (coffee dust), which is excusable for a grinder priced so reasonably. Unfortunately, espresso is certainly out of the question, as the aforementioned fines production is detrimental to espresso. Also, the lack of variability in grind selection makes proper espresso impossible with this machine. The only other point I can dock this device on is the complete lack of internal cleaning options. There is simply no way to reasonably open the machine up and clean the burrs. You certainly don't want to use flavored coffees in this machine because any other high quality bean will be tarnished by whatever's been previously passed through the machine.\n\nThe bad parts aside, this is a great machine for the basic home coffee brewer. I've never had problems making french press coffee and I'm sure it is fine for drip machines, aeropresses and manual brewers alike. If nothing else you will certainly get a good service life out of the device, just be sure to never put any spices through this thing!"

Basically the motor stops working. I could tell last week something was going wrong because I could hear the motor sputtering while it was running. It initially started to grind less than the desired amount, so I started to stir the beans while grinding...thinking this might help. This did not prevent the inevitable from happening and within 2 weeks of hearing the struggling motor, it died completely. This is wholly unacceptable and I am out the $80.00 I spent on the first one, due to buying on-line. Fortunately I purchased the 2nd one locally, saved the receipt, and will be promptly returning it. One might be asking themselves why I bought it a second time...I thought the first time might have been user error (not really sure how I could have caused it, however, it is a morning product after all, and you just never know what takes place before that first cup of the day...plus, I was giving the name brand product the benefit of the doubt!)

I can live with that.\n\nThe finest grind setting is still a little more coarse than what I'm used to with espresso, and it is a bit of trouble to clean out and switch to decaf.\n\nThe biggest negative is that I had the same switch problems others mentioned; mine died after 8 months. In Cuisinart's favor, they actually shipped me out a new one before they got my bad one. It's possible they had a bad batch of switches and now realize it.\n\nIf you decide to get this grinder, be sure to register it!

I got a little worried after reading some of the reviews, but the more research and experimenting I have done, the more I have discovered how capable this grinder can be paired with my particular espresso machine.\n\nFirst, One of things I have read repeatedly in reviews of this grinder is - \"Does Not Grind fine enough for espresso.\" The problem here is that this is a blanket statement. Many people assume that espresso must be ground to a fine powder. These are usually the people that also assume espresso is a particular type of bean, or has to be a dark roast.\n\nTo clarify, the espresso machine mentioned above uses pressurized portafilters. Many espresso purists will balk at this, but they are not all bad. Through a lot of research I found several articles talking about how pressurized portafilters are good to learn on. They do not require as fine of grind as non-pressurized versions, and they also require less tamp. If you use too fine of grounds and too hard of a tamp, you will most likely choke your machine with a pressurized portafilter.\n\nI have had good results on the next to finest grind setting, and the finest setting depending on the bean. These settings are much finer than a blade grinder, and you get less heat transfer to the beans.\n\nI cannot attest to the durability as I have only had it for a month. I have had no issues cleaning the grinder. I have found that less oily beans will provide a little more consistent grind. For instance, I got really nice grind from some Illy medium roast decaf beans the other day.\n\nExpectations:\nI don't think this grinder would grind quite fine enough for a traditional style protafilter, but many home machines are pressurized, so it isn't an issue. I think the disappointment lies when people expect this to be what it is not. If you spend $800 on an espresso machine, and $50 on a grinder then yeah it probably won't live up to your expectations, but then again those expectations are unrealistic.\n\nBottom Line:\nPaired with the Cuisinart EM-200 I have gotten fantastic results. The unit feels solid, looks sharp and so far has performed well. Don't simply assume that you cannot use this grinder for espresso without doing a little research first."

I have experienced some major issues that were there right out of the box, so the issues did not happen from heavy use. The grounds end up everywhere. The grounds continue to fall out of the grinder once the cup is removed. It also clings to the plastic container rather bed. As the grounds end all over the base they become lodged in the crevices which prevents the cup being placed in a position where it will allow the grinder to turn on. Surprised at the poor design from a brand like cuisinart"

            "reviewText": "My brewing method: I grind beans as needed, boil water in a tea kettle, and use a plastic cone with paper filters. Usually two mugs a day. I've had the... hold on... just turned my unit over to check - grinder model #CCM-SA - for somewhere around six years. (It looks exactly like the \"CCM-16PC1\" now being sold in 2011.) I've only cleaned it a few times but should probably do so more often. I've never had a real problem with the unit; it just does its thing, every time. Consistent grind? I don't care. In fact, I sometimes swing the grind setting thingie back and forth while it's working so I'll get a variety of fine to coarse. Call me crazy. Foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds. (If you're into French Press or espresso or whatever requires a precise grind maybe this unit isn't for you.)\n\nStatic cling? Yes. What this means is that once every week I use a brush instead of just knocking a spoon against the plastic bin to knock the grind out. I use the opportunity to wash the bin. As a negative this is not worth even a quarter of a star deduction. About a year ago all that spoon-knocking finally started a crack forming in the plastic bin. The crack grew only very slowly. (The bin must be made of Lexan or some other amazing plastic.) I contacted Customer Service and they sent me a new bin with a minimum of fuss or bother.\n\nFor decades before this I'd been using those small bladed grinders - one after another as they broke. If that's your current situation I can say that the improvement is definitely worth the roughly doubled price tag. With luck the frequency of replacement might be halved, so the cost will work out the same in the long run. A burr grinder is going to take up more counter space, but it makes better coffee. If/when my unit starts to break down I'd not hesitate to buy another.\n\nOne word of advice: once you've figured out exactly where to set the sliding time control for the amount of coffee you need, make some sort of permanent mark as a reference. It's easy to accidentally knock the control slider out of place and suddenly you're getting coffee that's too weak or too strong. Of course, you may want to slightly alter the setting depending on the strength of the beans you've bought; having the average point marked is even more valuable then."

            "reviewText": "\u00a0The Cuisinart DBM-8 Burr Grinder is provides an highly consistent grind at a very reasonable price. It does have flaws, but once it is viewed against products that are 2x its price. I will caution that it is not easy to clean the \"guts\" of the machine so this may not be the machine for you if you plan to grind a variety of coffee styles or spices. Trust me if you burr grind fresh vanilla coffee beans and then follow it with a bold French Roast... your French Roast will have an unexpected flavor!\n\nPros -\n\n- Inexpensive\n- Multiple settings for grinding - everything from fine to French Press coarse.\n- One-button to push then you are able to walk-away\n- Not much to clean - but clean-up is a snap.\n- 1/2lb bean capacity\n- Nice finish - it does not look \"cheap\". From the looks you would expect that it cost 2-3x the actual price\n\nCautions-\n\n- Again, it is impossible to clean the inner-workings of the machine so you will have residual that will be mixed into your next grind.\n- Not overly powered - at times it seems like it is straining which makes me worry about long-term durability.\n- Pretty loud - I am not sure if it could be made \"quiet\"\n- Pretty large footprint - you may want to make sure that you have counter-space\n\nFinal Verdict - I may change my review if the Cuisinart DBM-8 dies a quick death, but for now it has surpassed my expectations. There are better burr grinders available, but be prepared to spend considerably more money.\n\n5 Stars"

This winter, after 18 months of use, my grinder started having the same challenges. Now it is somewhat impossible to transfer the ground coffee to your machine or drip system without grinds going everywhere. My solution is to wipe the counter with a wet cloth after using, and sweep the floor more often. I anticipate the problem will lessen as the humidity levels rise throughout spring/summer. I also own a Maestro Plus, and that grinder has no static electricity problems but did cost 3 times as much."

The container for the grounds was delightfully static-free when removing the ground coffee. If you make only drip-style coffee, this would still be a good choice; if you want a consistent find grind, you will want a different grinder.

            "reviewText": "I use an electric espresso machine during the week and a french press on the weekends, so having a coffee mill that adjusts accordingly is crucial. The finest setting is perfect for the Bialatti electric espresso machine, creating a powdery coffee grind that extracts a lot of flavor. And the highest settings create a perfectly course grind for the french press for those weekend mornings when I have more time to linger over my cup(s). When grinding, however, the mill does produce a fine dust that gets all over the counter, so that's a bit of a pain. Perhaps most disconcerting, however, is that both the coffee bean holder & the grounds holder are made with #7 plastic, which is reported to be one of the less \"stable\" plastics (in other words, it releases toxins into food--especially if scratched). In the end, the price is good and it does the trick. But I wish that Cuisinart would opt for better quality plastics (or better yet, safer materials altogether)."

The plastic bean chamber that threads into the drive using a plastic shaft cracked, I guess from changing the grind size.\n\nFortunately, a replacement ordered at Cuisinart.com only cost 8 dollars. Unfortunately, a month after ordering it and receiving two shipping dates, I just received an email telling me that \"due to high demand, the product is out of stock\" and they hope to ship in 30 days. A replacement part that is out of stock due to high demand is not a good thing. I cancelled my order and bought the Capresso model thru Amazon..hopefully it is better. At least they didn't charge my credit card.\n\nOh, by the way, the unit didn't even work that good...the consistency of the grind was no different than my ten buck blade grinder."

I eventually figured out that the safety switch wasn't working. I had to put a piece of tape on the bottom of the grind bin to activate the switch that tells the machine that the bin is in place and ready to use. When I did get it working, it started shooting ground coffee all over the place, because the grind bin was too short, leaving about a 1/4 inch gap where it should have been totally enclosed. I didn't want to waste additional money on returning the unit, and I really couldn't wait for a grinder, so I double-folded tape around the lip of the grind bin so it would cover the gap and make less mess on every use, which it usually did anyway. Even if it was of an adequate height to fit the unit, it still makes a big mess because there is coffee powder all over the underside of the unit every time you use it (where the grind bin goes).\n\nIt was quite noisy in comparison to my current grinder, the Cuisinart DBM-8 is about the same volume as a vacuum cleaner. After months of daily use, it started sounding funny, like a low rumble. I would now compare the current volume level to a lawn mower. Fearing that the unit was going bad, I got a\u00a0Capresso Infinity, which is a superior product in so many ways. No mess at all, and the grind is much finer and more even, which is a must for good espresso. It is also exponentially quieter, you could even hear talking over it. Unfortunately I didn't have the luxury of trying them out before my purchase.\n\nI am not expecting the Cuisinart to perform at the same level as the Capresso Infinity, but the point is, don't waste your money on this pile of garbage, there are many options in the under-$100 category to choose from."

            "reviewText": "I needed a wedding shower gift and since the bride and groom love coffee and I love this grinder I thought it would be perfect. For some reason I started reading the reviews and frankly I was shocked. I have been using coffee grinders for several years and I have owned this one for at least six. It could break down tomorrow but I have absolutely zero complaints if it does. I liked the grinder so much I also purchased the Cuisinart Coffee On Demand coffee maker. I'd recommend that too. Not only has this grinder outlasted all the others, for an inexpensive grinder it has the same exact features as the pricier ones. I can't believe some of the things people have complained about.First when you are grinding you do not ever leave the grinder. With anything like this there is a chance of beans getting caught and bogging down the motor. If this happens you should stop it immediately and clear the blockage. Otherwise you can burn the motor up. I have seldom had this happen but it's the owner's responsibility to stop the machine when it does. Expensive grinders are not an exception to this.Second, yes there is some static in the plastic and every time there are a few grounds that make their way to my countertop. Simple solution: dampen a paper towel and it wipes right up. Not too complicated and well worth having freshly ground coffee every day.Third, at the end of a grinding cycle turn the machine back on to make sure all the coffee has cleared the chute. Run it without any beans so that nothing is left to block the free flow of ground coffee. It will sing loudly but you do not want a clogged chute. At least once a week wash the plastic container to keep your coffee fresh.Last, if you don't like noise perhaps you should think about buying your coffee already ground. I love this machine and with a just a minimum of care it will grind a perfect coffee for several years. I know sometimes there can be defects. If that is the case it is not because this isn't a great grinder.That's going to be my gift to the lucky couple because I don't think I can get anything better even at the higher prices. Learned a long time ago more expensive doesn't mean better."

None of this worked and the grinder continued to get worse such that it now will not grind at all. It just stalls and grinds for maybe a millisecond and then shuts off. Very frustrating because I expected years of faithful service from this Cuisinart product. Now it sits in a drawer collecting dust and I'm thoroughly unhappy with it.

I typically make espresso one or two shots at a time and I have had no trouble adjusting the grind time to get the proper amount for just one shot.\n\nThe only complaint I have has to do with the plastic grind reservoir. The static energy charge on it does create a mess when removing the grinds. However, this was true with the La Pavoni and I suspect will improve with time."

And about 8 complaints per page! Guess Cuisinart doesn't practice RWT (real world testing) because this grinder is a big failure. I'm taking it back to the store and will look for another brand. The problem I believe is too many safety switches, all those little buttons must be pressed or motor won't turn on. One site suggests to open bottom, remove fuse, and solder wires together. Too much trouble, just make a grinder that works."

It's ended up gathering dusk because I would have to grind it in the Cuisinart and then follow it with the Krups mini grinder (which does a fantastic job in itself). Now I just skip the Cuisinart and use the mini grinder from Krups. If you are buying for your normal every day coffee pot, then go for it. Otherwise, I couldn't recommend it."

It may not be a professional-grade superstar, but it's still a big step up from the old blade grinder that you have to stand there and hold, hoping you get the timing right and never getting consistent results.\n\nI have had this grinder almost a year, and I've used it daily without any problems. With the \"fine\" grind (a few clicks above the finest grind setting), it makes beautiful espresso with a rich crema using my Starbucks Barista espresso maker.\n\nMy biggest complaints are that:\n1. This builds up a ridiculous amount of static as it grinds, so when you open the lid of the container to scoop out the espresso, coffee grounds literally go shooting out all over the counter and stick to both the lid and the sides of the container. Very messy. It helps to keep the lid on and bang it against the counter a few times to knock the grinds down into the bottom of the container before opening it.\n2. On the fine grind setting, the little chute into the container can clog up pretty badly after a while (a couple of months, in my experience) if you don't brush it out regularly.\n\nOverall a good machine and definitely worth the upgrade from a blade grinder."

Whatever the setting, it produced fine grounds mixed with a high degree of dust, which meant the machine frequently clogged. Although it was easy to clean, dust is subpar for french press coffee. Yes, I should have returned it earlier (when it was still under warranty - 18 mos.), but that's water under the bridge now. Anyway, I just wanted to chime in about this machine as I am shopping for its replacement this morning, which may be a Bodum model."

Just pulled the hopper up to see plastic shrapnel. I put it aside for a few months because I was so disappointed in it. I finally took a closer look and saw that one half of the burr mechanism, made of metal, is screwed into the plastic tip of the hopper funnel. Did not see buildup of grounds-- just that the plastic part shattered--right in the exact places where the screws are located to attach the burr plate to the funnel. Why this manufacturer would make ANY part connected to the burr mechanism out of plastic is beyond me. I found I could replace this piece (hopper clear part + funnel brown part + attached metal burr plate) for $12 so I'll give it another try. Good grief!"

Also, the on off switch is secured inside the case by two thin (1/6th inch) plastic rods which go through the switch and are melted on top. The least stress pulls the switch off the rods making it inaccesible to the outer sliding switch...You then can't turn it off. Save your money and buy a decent grinder.

What a mistake. The combination of coffee dust and static cling is incredibly irritating, as is trying to get it all to grind - there's always one or two pieces bouncing around, refusing to go down through the grinder, which means I run the noisy thing longer than I should. There's coffee dust all over the place, all of the time. The coffee isn't very evenly ground either, IMHO. Does it make a better-tasting cup? I'm not enough of a pro to be able to tell, but I know it was a MUCH simpler process with my blade grinder, and a great deal less messy. I regret asking my husband to buy this big, loud, messy monstrosity for me. I actually grind coffee less often. The only reason I'm not giving it one star is because some of this might be my own inexperience, and I have yet to try using it to grind finer-grind coffee...if it makes a good cup of Greek coffee or espresso, I might forgive it."

We used it for both espresso and french press and never had any complaints.\n\nBut I could tell from day one how flimsy the unit is, and it didn't take long for the hopper to pretty much disintegrate. It didn't look so flimsy in the pictures when I bought it, but looking at the pics again you can see the poor quality of construction if you look closely.\n\nSo for $20 I might give it a good review, but this thing is almost $100 and for that much money I expect at least a little bit of durability.\n\nWe just ordered the Kitchenaid grinder from Amazon. It's a bit more pricey but it's solid metal construction and both the hopper and the bins are glass instead of cheap plastic. It looks like it will last 20 years, and all the other burr grinders I looked at in this price range look like cheap plastic too. Even some of the really expensive ones look cheap. Maybe some people don't care that they pay good money and get poor construction but I do. Frankly, the quality of construction is almost insulting.\n\nSo maybe for light duty if someone is extremely gentle with the unit it might be a good grinder, but for daily use I'd say pass. To me it doesn't matter if it's half the price of the Kitchenaid grinder if it won't last."

It won't stick so you have to stand there and hold the switch down to grind your coffee. Recently the opposite happened and now the switch is stuck in the \"on\" position so you have to operate the unit by plugging and unplugging. Just today, the motor gave out. All this within a year and I don't even use the thing that much. Looks nice and I like the design, but it's total junk. Do yourself a favor and buy something from another manufacturer. That's what I'll be doing today."

So the cup setting is worthless. Beware if you have a problem with the grinder, keep your receipt. When you call Cuisinart, they run the serial number to see when the unit was made. So they go off of that for your date of purchase. The problem is, if it set in a store or warehouse for a long time, your screwed if you can't supply a receipt to prove when you actually purchased it. Also, you have to pay for shipping to Cuisinart and inclose a check for $4.00 for return shipping.

            "reviewText": "I have had the DBM-8 coffee mill for several months now. I am not one to have great expectations for coffee mills and I have adapted my use to manage the quirks in the machine. For example, when the mill has finished grinding, I pull out the bin and rap it on the counter. This kicks loose the powder clinging to the sides of the bin, making it easier to dump it into the coffee maker basket.\n\nThere are two features of this mill that can be liabilities. The first is the automatic portion feature. Slide the slider to the number of cups of coffee you are making and press the Start button. Very simple to use, but I have discovered it grinds a lot more coffee than I like to use. For example, if I am making 4 cups, and I set the mill to 4 cups, I get about 6 tablespoons of ground coffee. Some may like their coffee that strong, but I prefer the old one-tablespoon-per-cup rule. As a result, I\u2019m left guessing which setting will get me closest to the amount I need, or using a coffee scoop after all. Using a coffee scoop to confirm what the mill should be doing automatically bugs me.\n\nThe other feature is the nice, big bin to hold the whole beans. It\u2019s great unless you like to switch coffees from time-to-time. I like to use a different coffee on weekends. To do that, I have to empty the bin and reload it with weekend beans. Monday mornings I reverse the process.\n\nIn all, it is a pretty good mill for the money. I just wish it would deliver the correct amount of ground coffee for the setting."

No matter what grind setting I use, for every four or five tablespoons of beans ground, there is at least a teaspoon of very fine powder. Much of that clings in a clump to the side of the bin opposite the hole the ground coffee is blown out of into the bin. I suppose one can try to separate and throw out that powder, but there will obviously be plenty left mixed in with the grounds that will end up in the coffee poured from a French press.\n\nFrankly, I think a $15.00 chopper leaves one with less powder than this machine, especially if one chops in bursts and gently shakes the chopper a few times during chopping to mix the beans a bit. Also, with a chopper I find that most of the powder, in smaller amounts and not as fine as this machine generates, is at the bottom of the chopper and the ground coffee can simply be poured out leaving the powder.\n\nCleaning this machine is, of course, much more involved than cleaning a chopper and it does not appear to me that one can actually really get the grinding mechanism in the machine body cleared of the powder it produces. Maybe you could if you keep an air compressor and hose handy in your kitchen, but I think that's not a common kitchen appliance."

But the convenience of not having to fill each day is nice; a trade-off.\n\n1/2/2016 Update: When the motor burned out, Macy's replaced it free, because it was still within the warranty. We are still using the replacement model to this day and it works fine. We like that it gives a consistent grind based on settings.

I was motivated to write this review, though, because I am tired of the noise. I cringe every morning I turn it on because the thing is so loud. Some times I cover it with a kitchen towel or two to dampen the noise. I have often fantasized about making a quilted cover similar to a tea cozy that fits the machine so I can slide the hood over it while it grinds. The other downside is it makes a big mess of ground coffee on the counter when you remove the lid due to the static electricity mentioned by others. Now my routine is to remove the container and tap it in the sink a few times to get all the grounds to settle before opening it over the sink, but even this method does not completely avoid the mess. All this has made me consider getting one of the all-in-one grinder/brewers to avoid the mess and so that I can set the timer to go off when I don't have to listen to the noise. Alas, I am an espresso drinker and all that integration is available mainly in investment-grade setups."

So all in all we like it and were disappointed when it broke.\n\nNow, the break probably had something to do with a user error issue, but I won't get into that here. But the reason I'm bothering to write this review is that when I emailed Cuisinart support to ask about repair/replacement, they were extremely responsive and immediately offered to replace the thing for $10. But I was busy and didn't get around to sending the old one back for a few days, and within a week a brand new one just showed up on my doorstep even though I never even paid the shipping cost.

One review is right about the plastic container and that the static makes the coffee stick to the sides, but as you try to cut costs Glass is expensive. I like that you can just grind just what you need 2 cups, 4 cups, 12 cups or shut the grinder off in the middle of grinding. Granted I grind about 1/2 lb. at a time, and then clean my grinder up with the included brush, thus haven't had any jams.

We're just trying to grind coffee for a drip maker so we don't need a perfect espresso grind. It has a nice big bean hopper but the collecting jar capacity is much smaller so you can't really grind a whole bag of coffee in one go. This is not a big deal but you need to keep an eye on it. Keeping an eye on it is a real problem though. The machine makes an unbelievable squealing noise while grinding. I thought blade grinders were bad, but this is intolerable. The only solution is to shut the thing off or leave the room. However, you can't do the latter if you have just filled the bean hopper, or else the collection jar will overflow. Finally to add insult to injury, the mill would get jammed on beans because the motor is too weak.\nOverall, it was a waste of counter space.\n\nPros:\n1. Compact design.\n2. Esthetic styling\n3.

Purchased an aeropress - the day it arrived was when grinder #2 died. Is it really that hard to manufacture a decent grinder?"

It clogs much more readily with the oil coated beans. Dry beans, such as starbucks, are much less likely to stick in the opening. The reason my 1 star is that the threads on the hopper disintegrated after a while and the hopper would no longer screw into the base. The threads are made of plastic and are a bit delicate. Would have made more sense if they were steel, as this part of the hopper is an integral part of the grind chamber. Well it is the trash hep for this one."

            "reviewText": "I've used this coffee grinder for about seven months and have mostly been happy with it. It consistently yields a solid grind with very little powder or inconsistent sizes to the grinds. I've never tried to make an espresso grind with it (I suspect finding any good espresso grinder in this price range is unrealistic) but have used it for both french press and my Bonavita coffee maker. I've found that the many grind options are great for drip coffee as I can experiment with finding the perfect grind depending on the roast I'm using that week. I tend to like lighter roasts and avoid the stout bitter taste of a dark roast but I've found I can usually manipulate the texture/taste of the coffee quite well with the grind settings. It allows me to enjoy some roasts I might normally avoid if I couldn't get the right grind texture.\n\nMy main criticisms of it (like others on here) is not the quality of the grind but the usability of the grinder. The grind receptacle is made of plastic and thus you get a lot of static cling. When pouring the grinds into your coffee maker, it can often make a little bit of a mess, and in fact, I've gotten to where I pour the grinds into my filter over the sink. Otherwise, I get grinds in the coffee maker or on the counter. The receptacle also doesn't always slide neatly into the grinder. I've found that something as simple as putting the receptacle back into the grinder can be a little irritating, especially when doing this in the morning before really waking up (the cruel irony, I suppose, of coffee equipment is that you use it before you're fully alert).\n\nThese are all things I've learned to live with, though if the new Bodum grinder had been available seven months ago, I probably would have bought it instead. But based on price range of the machine and quality of the grind, I very much recommend it. Just anticipate a couple of annoying user issues."

            "reviewDate": "September 26, 2010",
            "reviewText": "Device operated well for 3+ years then wouldn't operate unless I maintained pressure on the hopper to engage a safety switch embedded in the base of unit which prohibits operation when the hopper is unscrewed. Not much chance I'd be attempting to shread carrots using this device, but I'm sure it has saved countless finger tips. I ultimately located a radial crack in the threaded section of the bean hopper which I glued to restore the function of the safety switch. The following info was discovered during investigation to potentially defeat the safety switch. I removed the bottom rubber feet, removed the base and was greeted by a 1/2 cup of grounds that spilled out. Removing the top I had at least a cup of ground coffee plop out in compressed coffee cake form. Why? The burr grinder includes a set of agitating metal blades to expel ground coffee from the grinds collection area below the grinding surfaces. The action of the blades on the ground coffee itself had scoured the sides of the ABS plastic body and ultimately wore a slot in the grind collecion reservoir inside the grinder chassis. This opening allowed coffee to enter the interior body of unit. I initially thought it was an ABS casting defect but then saw a distinct wear pattern. Looking down at the chamber with the discharge chute at 12 o'clock the most wear was at 11 and tapered off counter-clockwise. The scouring energy of grounds builds at 1 o'clock and is greatest prior to exiting the discharge chute at 12 o'clock. I urge Cuisinart to review this design. There are several issues of concern. The risk of fire from coffee collecting within chassis and proximity to motor, electronics, etc. The health risk of brewing ABS enriched coffee. Now, who can recommend a full metal chassis burr grinder? Follow Up: I repaired the damaged area with a piece of sheet metal that I glued into the damaged collection area. 6 months on the grinder still chugging along."

            "reviewText": "Our unit lasted a little less than a year with daily use. Before breaking (more on that later) it performed only... okay. Certainly better than the whirly-blade grinders, but don't think that you'll get the equivalent performance of a $200 machine. Grounds are less uniform and the poster that mentioned the fine powder, no matter the setting, is absolutely right.\n\nBuild quality is certainly not top-notch, which is expected at this price point. Build quality is to blame for the failure of our unit - there is a column at the bottom of the bean reservoir and the top plate of the grinding mechanism is attached to the bottom of that column. Beans flow from the reservoir, through the column and in to the grinder. While the top grinding plate is metal, the column that it is attached to is plastic - this is the part that broke on my unit, rendering the unit completely useless.\n\nBuy this unit if you don't want to spring for something four times as expensive, but be aware that it'll have less than 1/4 of the life-span of the more expensive unit and it'll be outperformed by a noticeable margin."

When opening the plastic receptacle, whatever coffee didn't stick to the inside would pop out all over the kitchen counter. Even in the summer it was a problem. Now that we are into the dry, 20 below Minnesota winter, I almost went back to buying ground coffee. I did, however, come up with a solution. I cut a half-inch strip of aluminum foil from the end of a roll and inserted about half of it into the plastic container. The remaining 6 inches was left to dangle out the front. I found that this totally resolved the static problem and the foil can be re-used forever."

Paying $20 to replace a defective $45 item seems excessive to me. The replacement grinder works. However, as many have reported, at the finest setting it doesn't grind finely enough to make espresso. In retrospect, I would have been smarter to apply that $20 to a grinder that can grind for espresso."

Unfortunately beans such as Starbucks French Roast will clog the grinder within a short time, and if you are not impeccable with cleaning it, your unit's fuse will blow rendering it useless. The Baratza line has a multi-use fusing circuit, that once your grinder cools down, it resets and you can continue using your grinder. The Cuisinart has many nice features, otherwise but this \"cost focused\" design is a major limit. For a self-liquidating price Cusinart will ship you a replacement unit during the warranty period. Recommend the Baratza line as much better alternative, until you find Cusinart listing \"overload reset protection.\" Cannot recommend this unit."

So much so, that on the first batch of beans, it had already caked up on the opposite side of the hole where the grinds come out. I can live with a little dust in my house, but, I don't want dust in my coffee... yes, I know the dust in my house is different, but, that's besides the point I'm trying to make. The point is, if the mill is making THAT much fine dust on the coarsest setting, then it'll be a LOT of sludge in my coffee.\n\nThe second thing I didn't like so much, was when I was taking it apart to clean it so I can take it back, my thumb brushed over top burr, and got a smatter of grease on my thumb. I don't know off of which part it separated itself from, but, eventually, it would've ended up in my coffee... I want grease in my burgers, not in my coffee.\n\nI wish I had the same luck as the majority of everyone on here did with it, but, I certainly didn't.

But even if you get over how loud it is, the plastic grind bin is the worst product design I've ever seen. The plastic gets a static charge which make grounds (I grind \"medium\") cling to it. I defy you to dump the grounds into a coffee pot without making a colossal mess. I've had 5 different people try it (to make sure it wasn't just me) but there are grounds on the counter, the floor, and all over the coffee pot itself. How could this have gotten thru product testing?!"

I had a Braun blade grinder for 10 years that we only retired because the plastic top finally got eaten away, but for a regular pot (filter or press), it made perfectly good coffee. It didn't do espresso, but then, neither does this."

So far the Cuisinart is holding up quite well to twice daily use but there are a couple of minor details that could use a bit of improvement.\nFirst, Cusinart touts the fact that the bin will hold up to a half pound of beans. Unfortunately, I prefer to alternate the varieties of coffee I use so there is absolutely no advantage in pouring a half pound in at a time. This fact also made it a bit tricky to correctly estimate the amount of beans needed for a single pot. ( Perhaps adding some sort of measurement indicators on the bin would help?)\nSecond, the bin holding the ground beans is extremely difficult to slide back in, a flaw the Krups had as well."

If the tab doesn't click into place, the grinder won't grind.\n\nMy question is why any engineer would place the entire functionality of a product on the durability of a SAN container. The container fell out of the drying rack and --pop-- off came the tab. Grinder no longer works.\n\nIt would have cost the manufacturer ~$1 more to make this container out of polycarbonate, which wouldn't break even if you stepped on it.

I do like the fact you can set the grind for fine to coarse but eliminating this the less expensive and quieter and quicker mill grinders suit my needs just fine. The machine states it grinds a half pound at a time but in reality the hopper holds about this much and it takes three or four cycles to empty the hopper. We are returning ours and going with the older mill grinder. Think twice before you buy."

While I appreciate the 6am workout (sometimes), I'm going to repurpose this machine into something it may be designed to do like particle reduction for items going into the compose pile.

It produces very thin shots because the grind is not fine enough and therefore the crema is almost nothing. It looks and tasted more like coffee than espresso! BUMMER!\n\nI called Cuisinart Customer Service to see if there is anything I could do to refine the setting so it was finer and she told me that that the machine should produce the correct grind. I explained I have seen many other reviews (now that I have bought it) that say it does not! She said sorry there is nothing wrong with the machine so you can't return it. I asked to talk to a manager and they were all in a \"business meeting\" ARGH!\n\nSo I will update this review when I hear back from them, hopefully with better news than I am out of luck and $50.00 into a grinder that does not grind as good as my $5.00 for Espresso Machines!"

But that leads to another problem, they put a micro switch that recognizes if the bean holder is on or off so cutting the 'stop' tells the machine to stop so you must open the machine ( which voids the warrenty) and bypass the micro switch. There easy right? I did it and it work well. I suggest just spending a little more and get a better one . Good luck!"

Whenever I did a coarse grind, there was also a fine clumpy powder that would stick to the lid. Which would make a nice coffee slushy but not a proper cup of joe. This grinder was a gift to me, so I thought I would stick with it but after three years the internal mechanism stripped the threads on the plastic hopper making it completely unusable.\n\nMy advice spend another $40 and get a better made grinder. The cuisinart was bad from beginning to end."

I've found that even on the finest grind setting, the results are much too coarse and uneven to brew proper espresso. Furthermore, this grinder is LOUD; the first time I ran it I thought the steel burrs were grinding themselves together.\nOther problems: The minimum setting is for 4 cups of coffee, which is far too much for a shot (or even a double shot) of espresso. And a good deal of grounds (about 2 cups worth) ends up stuck inside the machine, so to get freshly ground coffee you really first have to grind 2 cups and empty the bin, then grind what you need. This is a waste of coffee. And if you forget to put the plastic lid on the hopper when you slide it into place, grinds will fly everywhere, and there's no way to stop the grinding or put the lid into place short of unplugging the machine from the wall!! This is a serious design flaw.\nAnyhow, for making large amounts of drip coffee this grinder might decently serve the purpose, but otherwise I'd look elsewhere."

            "reviewText": "I'm a self proclaimed whole bean coffee snob. I've owned several grinders over the years and have become addicted to grinding my own beans when I'm ready for brewing my trusty cup o' joe. Since I have an espresso machine, drip coffee maker, and a variety of french presses I can't just use the one-grind-fits-all approach. But why have 2 or 3 grinders taking up cupboard or counter space when I can now just use this?\n\nThe traditional whirling blade grinders take a lot of practice to get the timing just right depending on what level of grind you are looking for. More often than not I ended up settling for something a little too fine or a little too course. Enter the first burr grinder of my amateur barista world: I loved the consistency of it but couldn't get a fine grind for espresso. So for the last year or so I've had to use both...\n\nNo longer! This Cuisinart grinder has been a blessing from coffee brewing heaven! The variability of grind options is amazing with this machine! I can grind up my beans to a powdered perfection for espresso or chunky enough to make cowboy coffee worthy of Jack Palance's Curly from City Slickers.\n\nAs far as the quality concerns another reviewer mentioned it must have been a bad unit. I've used this one daily for over a month and not even a hiccup! This grinder is well worth the price!"

However, it was not too long before our coffee started to taste really weak, and I knew something was wrong. When I took the machine apart, the entire burr grinder was jammed with ground coffee and the spot where the ground coffee exits into the holder was so clogged that only a small amount of coffee was actually able to make it out of the machine. The supplied cleaning brush was next to useless so I used a thin wooden skewer to scape the jammed coffee away from the sides of the interior. Doing this every couple of times gets tired real fast, and I am at the point of taking it back to the store. If only they could have designed it so the coffee does not get jammed! We use French Roast, or Blue Mountain which tends to be greasier than other types, so perhaps the problem does not occur so quickly with other roasts. But! I am absolutely certain that no matter what beans you use, your machine will get clogged.If there was no clogging, this machine would get 5 stars!"

If you own some French presses, you'll hate this grinder. If you own an espresso machine, you'll hate this thing. Also, you'll need a tray, because this thing is MESSY!!!"

This unit does suffer from the static issues, in that the collection bin is made of plastic and causes the ground coffee to stick to the walls and will make a mess when you open the lid to pour out the coffee. We're ready to try a better burr mill grinder now.\n\nGOOD:\n\n- Affordable\n\n- Nice looks\n\n- Adjustable grind settings\n\n- Auto shut off\n\n- Grinds designated amount of beans, so it's hands free\n\nBAD:\n\n- Very LOUD!\n\n- Plastic bin produces static grounds, making a mess\n\n- Inconsistent grind\n\n- Produces clumpy grind\n\n- Clogs\n\n- Hard to clean due to design"

It would only operate if the button was held down. Then it would only operate for a couple seconds after the button was pressed. So then I would have to sit there and press the button repeatedly for 5 minutes just to get enough grinds for one cup of coffee.\nNow it has stopped working altogether, except for a little purr when I push the button.\nI have tried cleaning it. I have tried resetting it. I have gone online to see if anyone else has this problem.\nLots of people are having this problem.\nI know it is a corporate trend these days... but...\nShame for making a disposable product that breaks so easily. This is contributing to the exponential mountains of TRASH and environmental destruction...\nI will not buy Cuisinart products again.\nSpend hard earned money on a company that respects the consumer and the environment."

            "reviewText": "This machine does not live up to its appearance, nor price.\n\nA burr-grider is supposed to:\n\nA) Produce consistent grids\n\nB) Operate at lower speeds then blade grinders.\n\nC) Be capable of making esspresso grade fine grinds.\n\nAfter $90 CAD and evaluating it against a $15 blade grinder with 1lb of beans, I can safely say that it does none of these. A complete let down. First off, it's extremely noisy, and I would wake up my entire house using it. Second, it operates at an enourmous speed, always producing ultra-fine powder in any grind level, even coarse: something a burr grinder should elieviate. Lastly, the finest setting is no where near fine enough for espresso. Upon further investigation, the burr used in this is the same as that used by Krups models and a few others, which also don't work that well. My guess is the design of burr dictates crazy high grinding speeds that ruin its performance. You pay for the lovely, seductive Cuissinart look, but that's all."
