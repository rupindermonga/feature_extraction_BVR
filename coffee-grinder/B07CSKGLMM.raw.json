            "reviewText": "=== 1 YEAR OF OWNERSHIP REVIEW ===\nI've now owned this grinder for a little less than a year, and I'm sad to say that it has not lived up to my initial impressions. The quality that I initially perceived is just not there with this product. There are three reasons that I'd like to go over to justify why I am adjusting my original 5 star review down to a 2 star review.\n\nReason 1: After just a month or two the grinder started making a buzzing noise when plugged in to the wall outlet, but powered off. The buzzing is not obnoxiously loud, but was loud enough to make me wander around my around my apartment searching for where the strange noise was coming from. I contacted OXO about the problem and they acknowledged that there are issues with this model starting to buzz over time. I was assured it would not impact the performance (which is hasn't) and that they would contact me when a replacement was available with the issue resolved. It has been several months and I still have not heard anything from them sadly. For now I just keep it unplugged on my counter and plug it in every time I go to use it.\n\nReason 2: The grinder now suddenly stops on it's own before the timer is done. In order to resume grinding I need to push down on the bean hopper. When the hopper is locked in place it presses down on a switch (a safety thing I presume) which allows it to start grinding, but even when locked in place the hopper does not sit flush in place and one edge of the hopper is raised up. Now whenever I use this grinder I have to stand over it and push down on the hopper until it is done.\n\nReason 3: This one is by far my biggest annoyance. The grinder no longer ejects all the ground coffee! If I put in 20g of beans, I will get about 16g ejected into the container. In order to get the remaining 4g of coffee out I have to give the grinder a good shake and run it again. I thought this might be happening due to it being clogged internally, so I pulled things out and cleaned everything very well, but it still happens.\n\n=== ORIGINAL REVIEW ===\nFirst I must say that I am thrilled to be the first reviewer of this product that didn't receive it for free. Well, I'm not thrilled that apparently everyone except me is getting free stuff, but I digress. Anyways due to the overwhelming amount of \"received this product for free\" reviews I will say that I was very hesitant to purchase this grinder since I was skeptical of fake reviews.\n\nIn my case it was finally time to upgrade from my Hario Skerton hand crank grinder (which is awful and never produced a consistent grind. A medium setting would produce fine dust and huge 1/4 pieces of beans. I don't know why people give it so much praise to be honest). I took a look all the big name grinders and a ton of the knockoffs that are available here on Amazon as well. I settled on this one because I have owned a few OXO products in the past and despite them being a little on the pricier side I'm always very happy with their build quality and design.\n\nI'm happy to say that this OXO Conical Burr Coffee Grinder is no exception to that! The quality is fantastic and I knew it was well built the moment I took it out of the box. Setting it up was a breeze and I was pleasantly surprised at how quiet this grinder is. It has a small footprint and fits well on my kitchen counter. The grind it produces is consistent whether you select fine, coarse, or anywhere in between. So far I have made coffee using a French Press, an Aeropress, and my new V60. All three turned out significantly better than the cups I was getting from my old hand grinder. If you're looking for a quality burr grinder that doesn't sound like a shop-vac I would definitely recommend this one."

            "reviewDate": "August 21, 2018",
            "reviewText": "I've owned two conical burr grinders in the $100 price range and they both make a big mess while grinding because of the static electricity they generate. The designers of the OXO completely eliminated the static problem by incorporating three design features: a metal grounds bin, a grounded power plug, and a lower motor RPM.\n\nThere is a little metal tab at the top of the bay that the grounds bin slides into which connects the metal bin to the ground prong on the 3-prong power plug. This grounds the metal bin giving the static electricity a path to dissipate to.\n\nI know the motor speed is slower than my previous grinders because it takes almost 30 seconds to grind the 60 grams of coffee I need to brew a pot. Not only does the lower RPM help to minimize static, but improves the quality of the grind. There are far fewer fines in the medium and coarse grind settings I use. The slower RPM also keeps the metal burrs from heating up as much and it lowers the noise level.\n\nThis grinder gets a solid five stars.\n\nUPDATE 9/3/18: I'm still very happy the grind quality. In doing a little more research, I've found that this grinder has 40mm burrs and runs at 400rpm which matches the specs of the highly rated $230\u00a0Baratza Virtuoso."

            "reviewDate": "January 5, 2019",
            "reviewText": "(I am an ex professional barista.)\n\nCONS:\n\n-The grounds container doesn't lock into place and will sometimes vibrate out during grinding. This is the only serious flaw with the product, and I feel it's a minor one. I've gone through many of the reviews and it seems that it's simply a matter of construction inconsistency. Most people's containers \"click\" into place; a minority do not. I was just unlucky enough to get one of the ones that don't.\n\n-You can't remove the bottom burr to clean it. They really did do their best to make this easy to clean and I appreciate that you don't have to undo a bunch of microscopic screws just to clean your burrs, but I really wish I could remove BOTH burrs to give them a thorough wipe-down. It's difficult to clean the one that's stuck inside the grinder. The other lifts out easily by a cute little handle.\n\nPROS:\n\n-High quality, consistent grind. The brewing methods I use most all hover around the medium grind range, so I haven't really tested the extremes of coarse and fine. Can't speak to those. But as far as the medium ranges, it grinds beautifully and consistently. That's what matters in the end, right?\n\n-The beans feed very well, even for single dosing. Never an issue.\n\n-As mentioned above, the ability to clean the grinder is taken into account in the construction. No need to delicately deconstruct the whole thing and keep track of a bunch of itty bitty screws and springs. The top part of the grinder and the top burr simply turn-and-lift out, and then turn-and-lock back into place. So nice.\n\n-It's aesthetically pleasing and takes up little room on the counter. All the materials have a quality feel.\n\n-It isn't super noisy. All grinders are gonna make noise, to be sure, but as far as grinders go, this one has a pretty gentle sound. I've definitely used my fair share of grinders that made me feel like my brain was going to vibrate out of my skull, and this one has a polite hum by comparison.\n\n-The price for this level of quality is unbeatable. I can't even believe I paid less than one hundred dollars for this. Real talk, folks: these are steel conical burrs. Solid construction. 40+ grind settings. Did I mention steel conical burrs? I never thought I would own something like this for less than $250. You cannot beat this price point/quality intersection. You just can't. This grinder is price-meets-quality king.\n\nUSAGE:\n\nYou're working with three variables: time, grind, and amount. There are two popular approaches to working out your dose.\n\nMethod 1: You leave 'amount' as the open variable. With this method, you dump all your beans in the hopper and store them there. You then adjust grind and time until you're getting the right dose at the right grind level.\n\nMethod 2: You leave 'time' as the open variable. With this method, you only deposit the amount of beans you plan to use for each dose, adjust the grind as needed, and let it take whatever amount of time it takes. You're adjusting the amount and the grind, rather than adjusting the grind and the time. (This is called \"single dosing.\")\n\nGo to any coffee forum, and you'll be pages of debate about which of these methods is superior. Honestly, you should use the method that feels best for YOU.\n\nThe reason I bring it up here is because people seem anxious that Method #2 will damage the burrs over time, since you run them all the way to empty every time you grind.\n\nHere's my take: I use Method #2, because I feel that the beans start to taste stale if left in the hopper. (Everyone's tastebuds are different; there's no right or wrong.) This means that I let the burrs run until I hear the sound change from a low growl to a high pitched growl, which indicates that the burrs are grinding empty, and then I manually stop the grind.\n\nI honestly don't see any issue with this, and I don't feel any anxiety about it. Think about it: if you're cleaning the burrs between bean swaps, you're letting them run for several seconds on empty anyway. Even the manufacturer instructions tell you to do this when cleaning the burrs! The only difference here is that instead of intentionally running them on empty for several seconds to clean them, you're running them on empty for one single second every day/dose. I'd never recommend doing that on a fine espresso setting, but as long as you're in the medium-to-coarse range, I don't see any possible ways the burrs could damage each other. There's no way the burrs are touching at that distance, regardless of variables like heat expanding the metal and other things coffee nerds like to debate about.\n\nI hope this review was helpful. I'll update in a year to let you know if this grinder held up through daily use."

            "reviewDate": "August 6, 2018",
            "reviewText": "I generally find this coffee grinder appealing.\nFirst, the stainless steel cup that locks into place during grinding. My previous grinder's cup would slowly vibrate out, causing ground coffee to fill up behind it, requiring clean up. That was resolved by wrapping a rubber band around the unit to hold the cup in place. No more rubber band with this OXO grinder.\nSecond, the timer preset is very handy and helps to consistently grinder the desired amount of coffee.\nThird, the overall dimensions, look and feel complement our kitchen.\n\nSo, with all of this why only three stars? My sole gripe with this unit is I cannot leave it unattended during grinding because it always fails to consistently feed beans down into the grinder. They get hung up for some reason and I have to shake or whack the unity to get the beans to continue to feed. This happens consistently and wasn't a problem with the older Capresso unit it replaced. But, again, I passed on Capresso this time because the cup would not stay in place during grinding."

I really enjoy using coffee grinders to get the freshest flavor from my coffee beans.\n\nI considered a number of different grinders, but I went with this one because it seemed simpler to operate, and there were a number of design features that drew me to it. Plus, OXO's older grinder seemed to get decent reviews.\n\n- This grinder is pretty quiet and quick to operate. I use the 12 grind setting, and leave the timer for 7 seconds and I get the perfect amount for 16 oz of water. I've been consistently getting the same amount of grounds every time.\n\n- The construction of the stainless steel removable burr with the plastic seems solid. I've seen other grinders with the burr in plastic housings that seem like they would fall apart after long term use. This grinder seems solid, but time will tell!\n\n- The chute and grounds cup does not leave grounds falling everywhere, nor is there a bunch of static, so I think this part is well-designed.\n\n- The footprint and overall size is pretty compact and the design is pretty clean and should fit in most kitchens."

            "reviewText": "I almost returned this thing after about two days of use; it had completely stopped working due to an internal clog, and the included de-clogging instructions were useless. However, with a little experimentation, I found a method that works reliably, and without as much fuss as I'd expected.\n\n1) Empty any remaining beans from the hopper into another container and set aside. Set the hopper aside as well, but empty; you'll need it again soon. Set aside the grounds bin as well, also empty.\n\n2) Remove the top burr grinder piece (its handle rotates up, and then you can twist it out) and set aside.\n\n3) Dump remaining loose coffee bits from around the burr grinder at the top of the machine into your separate container (just like from the hopper) and set that container aside. You won't need it again until after you're finished de-clogging.\n\n4) UNPLUG the machine. and get ready to make a bit of a mess (these next few steps are worth doing over a sink if you can, in order to reduce clean-up).\n\n5) Using a soft, non-metal utensil so as not to damage the burrs (I had a soft plastic lab pipette nearby which was perfect), gently scrape out any packed coffee grounds from around the bottom burr grinder on top of the machine. You won't get it all on the first attempt, just get what's easy.\n\n6) Using the same or similar utensil, poke up into the chute that coffee grounds normally come out of. Dislodge as much of the packed grounds as you can, then shake gently so that the stragglers will fall out.\n\n7) Taking the grinder back to its usual home, plug it back in and replace the bean hopper and the grounds bin but NOT the top burr grinder piece.\n\n8) Run the grinder like this, in short (5 second) bursts until grinds stop coming out.\n\n9) Remove the hopper and bin, then follow cleaning steps 4-8 once more. By the time you've done that second run, the machine should be mostly de-clogged.\n\n10) Scrape any caked-on coffee grounds from the top bur grinder, and put it back where it belongs (you'll need to remove the hopper to get access).\n\n11) Run one or two 5-second bursts to make sure everything's worked its way out, but your grinder should now be ready to use. Return your container of beans and bits to the hopper and grind away!\n\nHow does this thing get clogged in the first place? I was trying to grind enough coffee to fill a container to take to work, and the lid on top of this grinder's grounds bin does not provide a good view into the bin. When the grounds pile up to high, the machine backs up and will just keep compressing grounds together inside until it's totally jammed.\n\nHaving learned my lesson, I now take the lid off the grounds bin whenever I need to grind more than a single pot's coffee. This puts me at a slightly higher risk of mess, but the grounds don't shoot out badly and I can see when i need to dump the bin out into another container."

            "reviewText": "The grinder only selects grinding based on time - not on the number of desired cups like many grinders. While this is easy to calibrate to your liking, the grinder only grinds to 30 seconds. When we ground coffee, this was only enough for about 6 cups of coffee. So in order to brew a full pot of coffee, we would have to grind the beans, wait, then grind again - to get enough grounds to brew a full pot. Additionally, the hopper on our grinder seemed to slip out of place, even when in use. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that the hopper doesn't need to be in place for grinding to occur. So if the hopper becomes dislodged, the grinder keeps on grinding - all over the counter top."

            "reviewText": "Update 2: After using this a little longer, and reading reviews on many other grinders (considering replacement), I have decided to restore one star, because other than the failure to feed, which seems to happen with lots of grinders, this grinder really works well. What I started doing is stirring the beans in the hopper with a chopstick as I grind, and that cures the failure to feed, and gives a very consistent 24 grams of (full coarse) grinds on the \"10\" setting, which is slightly higher than I earlier reported.\n\nUpdate 1: I have now had consistent problems with the beans feeding, so I am deducting two stars. I think this grinder may be a victim of its own smoothness--they should have built some vibration into the feeder to help the beans go down. I love the grinder operation, but having to push the beans down, and then figure out how much coffee was already ground (because it will often partial grind), is a real pain. Might just give up and go back to hand grinding!\n\nOriginal Review:\n\nI had previously 'upgraded' from a hand grinder to a cheap electric burr grinder (Bellermain), but was not happy with it--the Bellermain unit was very loud, produced a very inconsistent grind (lots of fine material even on the coarsest setting), and, worst of all, very messy--the design resulted in grounds outside of the cup as well as sticking to the cup and getting all over when poured. I saw this on the \"Prime Day Launch\" page, and decided to order one, as it appeared to address all my concerns.\n\nI've only been using it for a few days now, but it is very quiet, grinds very consistently, and the grinds pour easily and cleanly from the cup. I have had two occurrences where it failed to grind--the beans were clumped a bit, and failed to feed--I'm currently using the Rwandan blend from the local club warehouse, which is reasonably oily, so this may or may not be an issue with other blends. A quick tap of the unit frees the beans to grind--does not seem to be an issue once it starts feeding--only when first started after sitting. I considered taking off a star for this, and may do that if I continue to have problems.\n\n(This section updated to reflect the slightly increased output I am seeing when stirring the beans to get them to feed.) On full coarse, I am getting about 2.4 grams per 'number' on the dial: dial set to 10 yields about 24 grams, etc. Seems like most recommend 7-10 grams of coffee per 6 ounce of water--I like to make mine at about 8 grams/6 oz, and I make about 18 ounces at a time, so I have the grinder set to 10. An easy way to estimate for your needs is: dial setting x2, plus 20 percent (e.g., dial at 15 x 2 = 30 + 6 = 36 grams)--this is for coarse setting--I have not experimented with the other settings, since I only make French Press."

The conical burrs are powerful (DC) and are a feature found only in the best grinders.\nQuiet operation, as far as coffee grinders go. Definitely one of the quietest I have used.\nSimple functions that are easy to use. Set your desired grind, set for how long, and push to start. The doubly expensive older brother to this grinder (OXO 8710200 On Conical Burr Coffee Grinder with Integrated Scale) has some additional features, but I don't think they justify the $200 price tag. You can buy a digital scale for less than $10.\nSpeaking of features, this one has a couple I like - UV protected hopper so you can keep beans up top and overheat protection so as not to burn your beans.\n\nI know this is a new product, of which I would normally be wary, but the solid build and luxurious feel of the grinder along with its quiet operation make me truly happy with this grinder so far."

            "reviewText": "This is a strange grinder in my opinion.\nCON: While it grinds well, deciphering choices is a learning experience - too steep a curve for my patience. Control for SIZE of grind has to be tried a few times to find your preference - not unlike any grinder. But the other control I feel is a very obscure dial for determining how LONG to grind - that is HOW MUCH coffee one wants ground! My other grinder that was too messy has a more sensible control for number of cups. I could easily \"gestimate\" what amount of water to match to it's cup designation. But now I need to estimate based on how long the machine is on - IN SECONDS? If you want to grind and then measure by scoop what you want, not having a problem of leaving some ground in the container until net time - it might work for you. I want to grind only what I use for the pot of coffee I am about to prepare.\nPRO: Other grinders I've used are messy because of static buildup. The ground coffee easily slips out without a mess. This grinder has a nice slim profile on my kitchen appliance crowded counter."

            "reviewText": "This product replaces an old Cuisinart grinder I have been using for many years. I kept it only because I didn't think I could find a better one at a reasonable price. I finally had it with coffee grounds flying all over the place and splurged for the OXO grinder. It is twice the cost of the Cuisinart, but worth every penny. This grinder is so quiet. The grind is so much more consistent. The best part is the stainless steel container. No more dancing coffee grounds. Just grind and dump the ground coffee into the basket with no fear. The unit looks great and fits on the counter as if it belongs there. I have always trusted OXO products and the coffee grinder is no exception."

            "reviewDate": "September 5, 2018",
            "reviewText": "UPDATE 09/08/2018: After having used this Oxo grinder for a few days now, I love it even more and wanted to add a couple of things to my original review. First, I may have been mistaken when I said the grinds container clicked into place. I think I may not have had the top completely on, and what I heard was the top clicking down. Still, I have not had any trouble with it moving out of place. I did press the little metal tab back, though I did not actually bend it or anything.\n\nSecond, I am more impressed with the grind. As I mentioned below, the grind is very uniform and produces MUCH less find powder. This is obvious to me in two ways. The Cuisinart sort of spews the grinds out a vertical opening and into the grinds container through a matching opening in the side of the container. In the process, a large deposit of powder builds up in one corner of the container. The Oxo drops the grinds straight down into the grinds container, seemingly more gently. There is no buildup anywhere and no obvious powder. The other thing I have noticed is that there is VERY little sludge at the bottom of my cup. I make my coffee in re-usable K-cups (I know, I know - Coffee heresy!) These are great, but, unlike paper filters, re-usable filters let through some of the very fine grounds. Coffee ground with the Cuisinart grinder, with its significant amount of powder, would leave a considerable amount of sludge. I would toss out about 1/4\" of coffee to avoid drinking it. I have purposely drunk down to the last drop with the new grinder and found only a few drops of sludge.\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\nI purchased the less expensive Cuisinart just over a year ago as a test to see if I really wanted to grind my own coffee on a regular basis. I have used it regularly ever since but was not entirely happy with it. When this Oxo came out on Prime Day it sounded like just what I wanted, but I waited a couple of months to get some real reviews, which continued to be very positive so I decided to take the leap. Just received it today, but I already like it better than the Cuisinart. It is noticeably quieter, grinds much more consistently, and does not produce powdery \"fines\" like the Cuisinart. Also, the stainless grounds container does not produce static cling like the Cuisinart's plastic container.\nAlthough at first the grounds container did not seem to click into place as it should, it did after a couple of tries. This failure to lock in seems to be a consistent complaint in reviews of this grinder so I will be keeping an eye on it.\n\nI figure it will take a day or two to dial in just the ground size I like and appropriate grind time for my needs, but those are just a matter of mechanics. I can already tell that I will be able to use a grind finer than I was able to use with the Cuisinart. Because the grind was less consistent the setting I used included everything from chunks to powder. The Oxo produces very consistent size grind.\n\nThe Cuisinart was so loud (much louder than I thought a burr grinder should produce) that if I needed to grind in the morning I had to wrap the grinder in a very heavy blanket to cut the noise and avoid waking my wife. I feel pretty sure that the much lower volume level of the Oxo will not require such precautions.\n\nAll in all, I consider this a great upgrade from the Cuisinart DBM-8."

My does not, if your's does, then you have a defect and exchange it. 2) The cup for the grounds does not 'click' into place. I can't replicate that problem, I tried but I can't snug it into position without it locking in. Try removing the cup and then press your thumb against the top of the wall, you should feel a flexible tab, if it doesn't flex (stuck into position) then it may just be a matter of lifting the grinder and visually inspecting and un-stick the tab..\n\nI bought the OXO because it is highly recommended by Consumer Reports. It arrived today and I will primarily use it for espresso. I ran an espresso grind to use this morning and then ran a test run at a medium (Drip) grind. In both cases the grinds were perfectly evenly ground and sized consistent with the settings. It is quite, has a very good quality 'feel' to it, very easy to use with everything working smoothly and as should (no problem 'clicking' the holder in position as some have reported), and is very attractive with a small counter-top footprint. It is a very straightforward efficient design so I see no reason to believe it will not be reliable. It is well worth the $100 price tag, don't waste your time and money buying cheaper brands."

When I grind coffee beans, coffee grinding mechanism is not reliable and stable in terms of keeping jammed and stuck that every time I have to clean the inside burr and somehow it doesn't give out the grinded coffee due to the pressed coffee attached to the path to output cup (small output but a lot of pressed coffee). It blocks the passage to the output cup. In my opinion, this is design defect. I just asked the refund."

            "reviewText": "This is the first conical burr grinder I've owned, so don't know how it compares to others. I do really like several things about it:\n\n1. Super easy to use. Load the beans in the top, and turn a dial to select a wide range of grind sizes. Select the number of seconds to grind and press a large button to start.\n2. It's fun to watch the beans disappear into the grinder!\n3. You can load the bean hopper up with a bunch of beans, but control how many are ground by selecting the time to grind\n\nThere's only one thing I don't care for and wish that Oxo would improve: It's quite loud. How about spending a few pennies and adding some sound deadening material to the inside of the unit, Oxo? It's also pricey, considering what it is...just grinding some coffee beans. This replaces a $13 blade grinder I used for years. Yes, I understand the difference in grind consistency with blade grinders vs. conical burr grinders. Time will tell if it holds up and makes it worth the extra cost. For now, I really like it.\n\nUPDATE 10/1/18:\nI have been noticing a buzzing noise in the kitchen lately. I traced it to the OXO burr grinder. We have multiple appliances plugged in at all times: a toaster oven, a regular toaster, an electric teapot, a Keurig, and an iCoffee machine (we have a big kitchen and often have guests!), and none of these appliances makes electrical buzzing noises when not in use. Anytime a small simple appliance like this makes a buzzing noise I am very concerned. There shouldn't be any noise coming from it, except when it's in use, and now I'm concerned about the safety. I'm not leaving it plugged in....will plug in when I need to use it until I can get a response from manufacturer, or possibly a replacement."

            "reviewText": "I bought this to replace our grinder that finally gave out after three years and three cross country moves. This grinder is looks good, and it offers a very consistent grind. On grind setting one the beans are ground into a near silica like dust for a perfect Turkish style coffee, and at setting 15 it is nice and course for a French press or cold brew. It is extremely quiet as well, at least compared to our old grinder. The hopper feeds the beans consistently, however I have noted that it favors feeding from the back of the hopper, so if you're low on beans in the hopper you may have to make adjustments during the grind.\n\nThe issue I have with the grinder is the \"L\" feed shoot from the burrs to the catch container. When doing fine grind (between 1 and 6) the coffee will pack in there like flour even with routine weekly cleaning. This clogs the feed chute up pretty quickly and results in having to disassemble the unit and shove a flexible plastic straw inside to break the clog apart. I've tried beans with different oils and roast levels (as dark roasts tend to be more oily) and no luck. We live in San Antonio, so it's not overly humid and I buy my beans from a reputable local roasting company. I've never experienced this issue with a coffee grinder before, but I've never seen an almost 90 degree bend in the feed shoot as well. Because of this, we've had to switch from weekly to daily cleaning of the grinder, which is a bit of an added hassle with both of us working, plus two kids and extracurriculars and our normal house work, which is why I'm giving it 2 stars."

My biggest complaint is the mess it makes as coffee goes everywhere because of static it generates when grinding coffee.\nThe OXO on the other hand, hasn't jammed up once since October. The timer (although not digital) is consistent, just like the Breville's digital timer, and there is not static mess when grinding coffee. I have used the same coffee in all three machines, so the static mess is dependent on the grinder not the coffee."

I mean... could it really make that much of a difference? Would it be worth it? I was pleasantly surprised! The consistency of the grind for my pour-over was perfect - SO much better than the inconsistant grind I was getting from my old machine. My morning cup of Joe is better than ever!\nI was also concerned that it would be noisy, but compared to my old mill grinder, it's really quiet. :-) It's easy to use, too. I simply pour in the amount of beans I want, set the grind # for the kind of coffee I'm preparing, set the timer (it usually takes about 20 seconds for the amount I use) and, voila! It auto-magically appears in the metal cup, which really does help with the static issue so many products have. BTW, inserting the cup doesn't really make a clicking sound. I just gently push it in until it feels snug. And, if I feel that it didn't grind all the beans in the allotted time I just push the timer again until the grinder makes a high-pitched sound, which lets me know all the beans are through.\nThe quality is great... I feel like it will last a long time. And, it's rather attractive. If machines could talk to one another this one would probably turn some heads: \"Hey Yo, OXO! You're the queen of burr... lookin' good!\"\nAll to say, I'm very happy with my purchase. Thanks OXO. You've made my life a little easier!"

While emptying the container the grounds \"jumped\" and stuck to the lid, outside of can, countertop and outside of grinder body. It made a huge mess and I was annoyed. I was ready to send it back after one use but decided to call the company first.\n\nAn OXO rep said they didn\u2019t know why some folks experienced this static problem while others did not. She said one employee has the same problem at her house but she remedied the problem by wiping the outside of the grounds container with a paper towel before she used it. They think it may be caused by atmospheric pressure or level of humidity in the air. This explanation sounded like BS to me - only ONE employee has troublesome pressure and/or humidity at their home? Do they live on a mountaintop in Arizona?\n\nSeveral days later I opened a new bag of coffee just to test the grinder even though I had plenty of ground coffee left. I wiped the outside of the can with a paper towel and wondered how a dry towel could have any affect - seemed like it would make the problem WORSE. It didn\u2019t help.\n\nI called OXO again and was told she THINKS the towel should be damp, but she couldn\u2019t really explain where to use it. Was I supposed to wipe just the inside of the can? Inside & outside? Inside the hopper? Outside of machine? She didn\u2019t know and I wasn\u2019t about to perform the entire ritual before every use!\n\nI used a damp towel on the inside/outside of the container and lid and that seemed to help.\nBut a new issue arose when I found that the container would not stay in place under the chute and kept sliding toward the front of the machine.\n\nAnother call to OXO.\nThey\u2019re aware of this problem and have designed a new container which is supposed to stay in place. I was asked if I would like one and I replied \"absolutely.\" Well, they don\u2019t have any available and don\u2019t know when they will, but \"will send me one when they come in.\" That was TWO MONTHS AGO and I\u2019ve never received one.\n\nOne reviewer claimed this unit has no static problems because the metal cup contacts a metal tab behind the chute which allows static electricity to dissipate out through the grounded cord. That\u2019s completely useless when vibration causes the cup to slide away from the tab after a few seconds.\n\nDuring that call I mentioned that many reviewers have reported another defect - a humming sound from the unit. The rep said OXO engineers are aware of the issue and have already determined the cause. New units will be manufactured that correct the issue, but no release date had been set.\n\nI asked if I could exchange mine when they come out and was told \"yes, as long as I bought my unit new from an OXO distributor.\" Since my unit was sold as a \"used\" unit, it would not be eligible for exchange.\n\nI had no choice but to return my unit to Amazon before the return period closed. I was surprised at the amount of coffee trapped in the burrs as I cleaned it before sending back, not sure that\u2019s a problem or not\n.\nWhat a waste of time and cause of aggravation this machine was!\n\nOn a positive note: It\u2019s fairly heavy and feels rugged.\nIt\u2019s quieter than my cheap B&D grinder (as it should be for $100!), quiet enough to use at night without fear of disturbing those in neighboring apartments."

There was always significant powdered coffee mixed with my coarse grind that I use for my French Press. Need to either drink the fine powdered coffee or leave the last sip in the coffee mug. I never heard of OXO and was a bit skeptical about spending a hundred bucks for a coffee grinder, but the reviews were good so I bought it. WHAT A DIFFERENCE!!!! No loud noise, no static electricity, all the coffee ground coarsely to perfection. No fine residue requiring cleaning every time. Bottom line, you get a much better product (in this case) when you spend the extra money, Extremely worthwhile as it is something I do first thing in the morning every day. Yet to see how long it will last, but everything about the grinder seems to be very high quality. Spend the extra money and you'll be glad you did."

It looks great sitting on a counter in your kitchen. The operation is smooth and very intuitive. Grind size is very consistent and it does both very fine and coarse quite well.\n\nThere are two things I would note could be improved here. First, there is a tendency for coffee grinds to collect behind the provided cup beneath the grinding chute. This isn't a big deal, but it does make the operation feel a little less polished. Second, the OXO brand decal on the center of the grind button has started showing signs of wear. This probably wasn't the best placement for a white decal as repeated use wears it down.\n\nOverall, amazing grinder that easily functions better than any I've used for this price range. I wholeheartedly recommend this to the beginner to mid-level coffee enthusiast!"

            "reviewText": "I have used this grinder for a week now and here are my comments.\n\nThis is my 3rd bean grinder (actually 4th if you count the hand grinder which was fine for 1 cup of pourover but ridiculous, not to mention hand numbing, to try and grind enough beans for an auto drip coffeemaker). My first purchase was the Cuisinart DBM-8. Nice unit, but ridiculous number of grind settings. You choose the amount by the number of cups (from 4-18). It took a while to get all the settings right but I was happy with it. Although the ground coffee was pretty well contained to the hopper, there was very little on my counter, but when you removed the hopper, there was some left behind on the unit itself, and the grind was not uniform, lots of dust. The biggest problem was static. If you tried to pour out the coffee right after grinding, very little came out. If I let it sit for 15-20 mins some poured out but the bottom 4 corners of the hopper were packed with grounds that had to be removed with a brush. I know the coffee purist adage is to grind the beans just before brewing, but I get up at 4AM and there\u2019s no way I wanted to wait almost half an hour (including brew time) to enjoy a cup of coffee. So I ground the beans the night before and after the static wait and brushing, I put them into a sealed container ready to put in the filter at 4AM. I was happy with that.\n\nAfter about 3 months, I started looking again and found the Bodum. Their claim was that because they a use borosilicate glass hopper that static was eliminated. Sounded plausible so I tried it. Um, not so fast Bodum. Not only was the static worse, I ended up with ground coffee on my counter. That lasted about 3 days before I sold it on CL for a few bucks less than what I paid to avoid returning it. I made the buyer aware of it\u2019s issues. Back to the Cuisinart for about 2 yrs.\n\nI recently found out that OXO was making a grinder that uses a stainless steel hopper. It has a grounded plug. There is a metal tab that contacts the steel hopper when in place and is supposed to eliminate static. Made sense so I bought it. The unit sells for $99.00 everywhere but when I perused the \u201cmore new and used\u201d offers on Amazon, this one was listed as new in original packaging but the packaging was damaged. Knowing how OXO packs their products, I bought it and was not disappointed. The unit was perfect and I saved $16+ in the process.\n\nI unpacked and set it up. I was very skeptical at first. Yes the hopper is stainless but there\u2019s a clear plastic lid that has a very large opening. I thought there was no way grounds wouldn\u2019t fly out but I was wrong. After a week of use, not a speck on the counter. The grind is much more uniform than the Cuisinart and the grind amount is set by time not cups. Much better. There\u2019s still more grind settings that I feel are necessary so I\u2019m still playing around with settings. The static is not totally eliminated but a gentle rap on the hopper lets the grounds pour out after about 5 mins. I will still grind the night before but this one\u2019s a keeper. Good job, OXO. Hope this helps anyone thinking about purchasing it."

You can get coffee out using scoop, leaving top of stainless canister on.\n\nWould be nice if it had a top that completely covered the ground coffee canister for storing -- but we use every day so our coffee doesn't sit in it long. Had a small Krups grinder (works just fine) -- but that we're \"coffee bean\" grinders vs Keurig -- this is much better.\n\nUPDATE 01/19: well---- definitely changed my opinion. HAD loved it. NOW: 5 stars reduced down to 1. It just stopped working, Gets clogged where the ground coffee comes out. Have taken apart unclogged, changed coffee beans (although we have had many many types that were fine), took apart pieces on top. No HELP. I posted on Amazon Community -- and got some good suggestions --- which we had actually already tried --- One said they had same issue and tossed the unit. that's where we are now; it's completely not un-usable. VERY disappointed in the unit -- and with OXO products (which I like). I even emailed OXO (since out of Amazon return period) -- they pretty much said want the community answers said. Got it working a few minutes but button is now not working. B In the meantime, have coffee beans -- but no grinder. Have to start looking again for one."

Others have mentioned no static but I find I have to bang the collection cup a few times to get all the coffee unstuck from the sides. Superficial cleaning is easy: remove the bean hopper and pull out the conical burr grinder, clean 'em off and shake out the machine. But it takes considerable effort to get all the packed in grinds and bean pieces out from around the base of the auger which, to the best of my knowledge, is not removable. Finally, after some time, the discharge chute becomes clogged and there is no direct path from the grinding chamber to the outside of the chute to bet a brush or pipe cleaner through there. Consequently, you never get all the debris out and it clogs up faster after that. Now, it's July, 2019 and it's pretty much toast. It dies in the middle of a grind or it just won't start at all. Looking for something more durable though I thought for $100 I was on firm ground(no pun intended). Guess not."

            "reviewText": "I have used this grinder in my kitchen at least once a day for over a year. I thought to write a review because I\u2019m about to buy a second one of these for my office.\n\n(And the price dropped from $100 to $80! It was already a good deal before.)\n\nI originally settled on this because I needed to switch to a conical-burr grinder after \u201cburning out\u201d two flat-burr grinders, one Krups and one Capresso. Too much friction over time? Bad luck? Both started to just go bzzzz after 3-6 months.\n\nSo I got this Oxo and it has shown zero signs of degradation. Everything I\u2019ve ever owned by Oxo has been a well-built and pleasing-to-use product. I also have two Oxo push-button sealing canisters for storing coffee that are 8+ years old and still work like new.\n\nThis grinder has worked great for me, after I figured out the quirks of using it, which took maybe 2 uses. Every grinder is a little different from every other, and they all have quirks.\n\nQuirk 1: when you pour the beans in the hopper, you need to tilt the entire grinder around once or twice to make the beans drop down to the bottom of the funnel. It\u2019s possible I\u2019m not using it exactly as designed - see my note about \u201csingle-dosing\u201d and precision below.\n\nQuirk 2: as other reviews have noted, there is an inconsistency in this product manufacturing such that some models randomly have a canister that \u2018clicks\u2019 into place and some randomly don\u2019t. Mine doesn\u2019t do the click. =\\ but the canister stays in place well enough anyway. Worst-case scenario, you hold it in place for a few seconds while the motor runs. I see a thousand ways the product designers could have more easily solved this problem, but I guess they didn\u2019t ask me.\n\nI \u201csingle-dose\u201d my coffee brews, meaning I weigh my beans with a scale, just enough to brew one cup - 22g beans for 350ml water if it\u2019s just me - then dump them in the hopper and grind only that amount per grind. The 22g of beans barely coats the bottom of the hopper; it probably has capacity to hold 300g or more at a time.\n\nIf your brewing method is not sensitive to precision, you can ignore this paragraph. Moving on: This grinder has a grind timer, but not a scale. I encourage you to use a kitchen scale alongside this grinder for measuring your beans per each grind. Leaving the hopper always full of beans means relying on this grinder\u2019s timer to measure the quantity of coffee you\u2019re grinding. Think about it: \u201ctime duration of beans ground\u201d is more variable than \u201cgrams of beans ground,\u201d so if you rely on time rather than weight you will end up grinding too much or too little for how much coffee you plan to make. This is true of any grinder that uses a timer, including this one. And that\u2019s qnot even to mention the freshness factor of storing in hopper vs storing in sealed container. Pre-measuring with a scale, then adding only the measured amount to the hopper for each grind, and letting the timer run its course, removes the imprecision from the equation. As a bonus it gives the burrs a second to self-clean by spinning off the excess chaff once all the beans are done grinding. Amazon sells another pricier Oxo grinder that has a scale attached, but honestly just do yourself a favor and buy a kitchen scale to weigh your beans, because a scale invariably needs cleaning or calibration. And by owning a scale you\u2019ll always make the right amount of spaghetti forever.\n\nThis grinder has a 1 to 15 coarseness scale, 15 being the most coarse. I leave it on 11. I am a die-hard paper-filter Chemex user and found that 11 is perfect for me. I have struggled to find a grinder that gets it exactly consistently right day-in day-out, and this one does perfect. I once got a lesson on brewing the perfect cup, from grind to water temp; the 11 setting on this grinder consistently mirrors the grind they demonstrated to me.\n\nSo buy this grinder. You owe yourself a good cup of coffee and a bad grinder is too much of an inconvenience to live with."

This one is very user friendly as described, but a pretty high pitch sound. Static issue seems to be well controlled. I only wish I found out about the $5 paddle wheel fix from Baratza for my old Barista before I ordered this. Had I known how the Baratza company services its products and helped so many people repair their old grinders, I would've ordered a Baratza Encore instead, just to do the right thing. The OXO is fine, but I think the right thing to do is give it away and buy a Baratza just to support the kind of company that deserves our business. I hate tossing out machines just because one part fails and can't be found, and evidently Baratza feels the same way. Update 3/2019: Well, things were going well until yesterday it just wouldn't turn on. Reset everything possible and used a different outlet nothing at all. We did notice it did not grind fine enough for even our Aero Press, so that was a little disappointing."

Part of why I got this one was because the reviews were phenomenal but it was cheaper than the others. And while I still haven't tried the others, I feel I made the right decision.\n\nPros:\n- Quiet! After I ran this one, I wished I had done a decibel test on my old one before I gave it away to compare!\n- Fast - a single cup of coffee I usually set this to just the 1second grind setting and it's perfect.\n- Consistent Grounds - the grind itself (and I do almost exclusively coarse for french press) is very consistent and has way less \"dust\" than my previous grinder.\n\nMixed Bag - I was looking forward to the stainless steel stating it had no static. There's still a *tiny* bit of static. I've found if I rinse the canister, just to get some moisture in there, that it reduces the static. And certainly every other grind that seems to be necessary. But it's also mid-winter and the humidity in the house is a little low this time of year. So it's not perfect, but it's a far sight better than the obnoxiousness I was dealing with before!\n\nOverall I love this grinder. It looks good, doesn't take up a ton of space, and grinds a pretty great cup of coffee."

I will start with the burr itself. My other grinder was a burr, yea. But it was the other type of burr, a plate burr. This one is the conical kind. It is way faster for course grinding. I use this for cold press. So I use the coarsest grind (15).\nBut here I can answer a question a lot of you probably already know. But some people are here because they need a coffee grinder because they understand that beans keep longer if they are not ground until the last. And they need to know (why a burr)? The choices are a burr, or a blade type grinder. A blade is hit or miss on if it meets a bean. Making for a product that is some ground to a find snuff. And some not ground at all. A burr does not let the bean through until they can fit through the crack. Making for a nice, uniform, end. And this grinder is fast and uniform.\nAnd the burr comes out if you want to clean it. They suggest to just brush the dust off. And to not put it in water. But I won\u2019t tell on you if you do. I did a couple times. Just set it out on a dish towel over night and let it dry. And that is most likely why they say that. People put the burr back wet and cause a short circuit. Or a fire.\nBut a conical burr (such as this one), is what you want for course or drip medium grind. A plate burr excels at a grind fine for expresso. So, that is most likely the answer to all your questions. This grinder is excellent for course grinding, I can attend to that. I have never tried a finer grind than 9 (smaller is finer). So I can\u2019t answer any questions on that end.\nIt is well constructed. I am pleased that they did not use cheap, inferior parts that will break easily. I\u2019m not saying you can throw it around like a basketball. But if you knock it over. I think it would survive. I would recommend this to anybody I know in the market for a coffee grinder.\nI just had to learn something. And I'll tell you guys, because maybe you will need to know this stuff someday. I tried to grind some beans that I had previously ground in the blender. I didn't do a good job. So I thought it would be a good idea to put them through the real grinder. It didn't work that way. The burr is made for coffee beans. Not ground coffee. It just clogged the exit chute all up. But not completely. Not yet. Five days later the chute stopped 100%. Turns out you clean that chute with a bottle brush. One of those little bitty ones. Or the video suggests a hex driver (Allen wrench). I got a half cup of grounds out. Now it is fast again. wee!!"

Cup that coffee grinds drop into hooks into the unit, so it doesn\u2019t fall/vibrate out. It is slightly loud while grinding, but I didn\u2019t really expect it to be quiet.\n\nSo really, a lot of the deficiencies bad reviews talked seemed to have been fixed. Did notice when I got this that it was the 2nd version, so that might be why. Very satisfied as of right now. Only time will of course\n\nUpdate 1:\nAfter having it for awhile, I\u2019ve decided to add a couple negative experiences I\u2019ve had with it.\n1. It has started a very low hum. Having a house with two kids and constant noise, plus the fact that You pretty much have to be Right next to it be able hear the humm, means it really doesn\u2019t bother me all that much. Time will tell whether the humm gets worse or annoys me more.\n2. Switched from a medium roast to a french roast, as well as to a grind setting of 7 1/2. Now notice that not all of the grinds Come out, some seeming to get stuck right after grinding. Not all, but enough to be annoying. Makes me wonder how accurate the amount grinder per timed setting is every time.\n\nThis also gets annoying while trying to clean it, as I try to do after every bag of coffee goes through. Grinds continuously fall out while brush the inside out. Also notice that, while cleaning it, Some coffee beans are still still on/in burr grinder. They are either partially to fully ungrounded.\n\nAgain, all of this is once I switched to a darker roast. Annoying enough to remove a star.\n\nHave gone back to a medium roast, and will update if there are any changes."

I wanted an industry grade burr grinder but those prices are not justified by my home coffee consumption (I am a little prissy coffee diva who can\u2019t afford a nice espresso machine at home so I just buy it hah!) so this machine had the highest reviews for my price point. I\u2019ve been using it for a few months and this could not be easier to use.\n\nIt\u2019s a sturdy machine and you can feel from it\u2019s heft it won\u2019t crap out on you. At a touch or a button you get perfectly ground coffee and it doesn\u2019t make a mess. The hopper holds exactly one bag of beans. I accidentally dropped the grinder from the top of my fridge fully expecting the plastic hopper to crack and all it did was bounce. The brushed steel keeps it nice and clean looking even after months of use. My boyfriend who was making a huge mess with his small bladed grinder and phobic of all things kitchen has eagerly embraced the product too. The little bladed grinder now is just a spice grinder."

Through trial and error I found that I had to clean it every day for it to work properly, and sometimes even one-half way through grinding enough beans for only a 4-cup pot. Yet, other than a few small fragments of bean in the burr area, the grinder is generally quite clean. There is no obvious reason for why it is stopping. If I wiggle the hopper knob, it will often finish grinding. What a pain!\nDefinitely not ready for Prime Time. But it does produce a uniform grind on the medium setting, in my opinion."

I previously bought whole beans from Starbucks and asked them to grind the whole bag for me. It was great, but I couldn't finish the bag quick enough and by about two weeks, I really tasted a difference in the coffee and it was really not as good as when it was first ground. I also bought prepackaged ground beans but I was also not happy with those flavors. After buying this grinder, my coffee has tasted exceptional. I am loving my coffee every time I drink it now. I have not had any issues with static cling as previous reviewers had mentioned. I just knock the metal tin a few times and the grounds come out. Any leftover grounds are insignificant to the actual coffee making process. Every 5 or 6 times I make coffee, I also wash the metal tin to clear all particles from the container. I also tap my burr grinder every now and then to empty any residuals that may have stuck in the grinder. No problems so far and I've had it for about two to three months now."

The Cuisinart is now held together by a rubber band, has a bad case of static cling, and racket-wise competes nicely with a 747 testing its engines. But hold it, this review is about the Oxo. Ok, yeah, sorry. The Oxo does a pretty nice job, is two notches less noisy than a 747, and has practically no static-cling. I would rate it higher except for the chinzy timer. Two problems with the timer: one, feels and works cheapo -- I predict that will be the first thing to break. Second, just how many cups is 30 seconds of grind anyway? Little or no guidance from the manufacturer on that score, so it's trial and error for this guy (I don't like to grind in advance...wait, what?). But that's not grounds for rejecting this aburrve average grinder. So I bought two, so what?"

            "reviewText": "NOTE: I have been using this grinder for brewing coffee, if you are using it for espresso my review may not be as relevant for you as others.\n\nThere are cheap grinders and expensive grinders, this one lands on the affordable side, but not cheap. What you get for the money is a well designed grinder that does the job well and is decent quality. It has conical burrs which are better than flat burrs and blades for consistency, it is not quiet but not real loud either, and it does a good consistent grind. The burrs are replaceable and the unit is easy to clean, thoroughly, if you are that kind of person. One super thing to note, the anti-static function works! WORKS GREAT! The catch basin is a metal and it is grounded, all static is gone, my last grinder was not like that and I have coffee grounds sticking to my hands and everything else within 6 inches on certain days.\n\nI read a lot of people had issue with the beans getting caught in hopper and not grinding, I think that happens with most grinders, just give the grinder a bump and it resumes grinding. This is also issue when you fill up the hopper or have dark roast coffee with more oils on surface, I recommend keeping the coffee in a separate container and dosing whole beans into hopper for each brew. I have not had the coffee get bound up in there once this way.\n\nSave yourself some money if you are thinking about buying $200-$300 grinder and get this one instead, I doubt you will regret it. Sure it does not have a fancy Italian name on the side, if that is an issue for you then spend the money. For the price this is a great purchase if you are weighing cost vs. quality. If you are thinking about buying a $15 blade grinder understand that they are not great but it will grind your coffee. The $40-$60 burr grinders also work but have their flaws, that is what I had previously and once it died I moved up to this one, good bye and good riddance to that old Cuisinart (to its credit it ground lot of coffee). $100 may seem like a lot to spend for some, but if you use this everyday it is worth it as this will probably last for years."

I do this by turning it back on when it appears to be done and I always find that another 2t come out. Not a great situation. Then today while cleaning it which I do religiously once a month here\u2019s what happened - after brushing, using the air from the grinder end and up the shoot I use \u201cgrinds\u201d on it. Then I beat on the sides and more coffee came out! So I added \u201cgrinds\u201d 2 more times And still a tsp of coffee came out each time!! I find this to be really unusual. I only grind 2 scoops of coffee weekdays and 4 on Saturday and Sunday. My husband who is a design engineer thinks that because the shoot is a right angle do the coffee catches in places that are hard to reach to clean. I plan to order extra \u201cgrinds\u201d today. One other complaint is that for some reason the letters on my start button have rubbed of and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever wiped it. I plan to contact OXO.

That may not seem like much, but a blade grinder just won't... to inconsistent of a grind and you're better off buying ground coffee than doing it yourself if you aren't going to do it right.\n\nTakes up more space than a little grinder, but it's powerful and delivers the goods. It is an investment, but at a much better price point than the ones that are several hundred dollars and up. I'd even give this a go if I was running an espresso stand, it has enough capacity for several customers (beans!, I mean coffee beans! Do not use on unruly customers!)\nat a time and in 20 seconds you have fresh ground beans.\n\nUPDATE : I've gotten a french press to try out and using a coarse grind of Nani's San Francisco beans for my first try on 13 setting, I got a very nice cup of coffee. So, I'm happy with it for use with my aeropress and a drip maker and a french press. I am not a coffee snob by any means, but I sure know the difference between swill and a good cup of joe. This lets me make a good cup of joe. I can say that I can now make a better cup of coffee than Folgers or Starbucks without having to cover up the harshness with sugary additives."

I'm now paranoid to buy another very expensive conical burr grinder with respect to getting another rock in it and destroying my grinder. After reading several reviews on this item I decided to make my purchase. what I really like about this grinder is that there is absolutely no static created after grinding the beans and therefor no mess. I did get a chance to play around with grind settings and it can grind the beans to very fine powder or dust to dang near gravel size grind (not sure why anybody would want that size but whatever, just putting it out there for you). The grinder is definitely quieter than my previous Breville grinder; however, the bean hopper on top is smaller, but the lid fits very snug to keep your beans fresh. I'm currently on a bag of medium roast beans (not oily at all), and have had no issues with the beans getting stuck to the hopper. My next bag will be a very oily French roast, and will keep everyone posted on how it handles them. Unless you clean your hopper every time you fill it, beans will get stuck with almost all burr grinders I have used. This machine's real estate is smaller than my Breville, and I like that as it leaves more room on my counter top. I was hesitant to buy this brand because I think of OXO as spatulas and potato peelers brand. Like many of my reviews I will keep this updated should anything go wrong or if I should find fault in the product."

We prefer a little on the course side for our drip coffee maker.\nHere's a hint: We use a Mr. Coffee drip maker. Pretty basic, right. Well, by accident I forgot to put the pot on the warmer plate under the spout. Luckily, this maker has the feature that stops filling the pot when it is not on the warming plate. So for the 2 minutes or so that the hot water was pouring over the beans but not going into the pot the freshly ground beans had a few moments to \"bloom\" to their full potential. Very similar to how a Chemex works by slowly going thru the filter. This mistake, plus having the Oxo grinder making freshly ground beans for every pot, has let us enjoy coffee at home better than most \"specialty\" coffee shops!"

It does the job nicely! Its footprint is small enough to not get in the way. It grinds coffee evenly and consistently. There\u2019s very little powder, regardless of whether we are grinding light roast or oilier dark roast beans. It\u2019s MUCH quieter than the Cuisinart disk burr grinder. I think it\u2019s even quieter than the blade grinder. The static issue is manageable. It\u2019s not completely static free, but the metal container does a very good job of keeping static under control.\nWe bought this unit in October 2018 and have used it virtually every day since. We have used different grinds for French Press, automatic drip, and pour-over. Not only have the grinds been even, but the adjustments make a noticeable difference. (i.e., Changing it a half \u201cpoint\u201d in either direction makes a difference, but provides fine enough control for our purposes.) We do not make espresso these days, so I only tried the finest setting once \u2013 when I needed a little coffee powder to add to brownie batter. It worked well for that purpose.\nThis one is a winner. Very happy with this purchase."

            "reviewText": "There are two things I like about this coffee grinder. First, the grind is very consistent. I mostly drink coffee from a drip coffee maker. As such consistency is not the most important quality, but it is nice to see coffee that looks like it was ground with one of the big machines at a grocery. I have owned more expensive grinders that don't produce this consistency at the settings for drip coffee. The second thing I'm impressed with is the grounds container. As mentioned I've owned other grinders. They've all had plastic containers. The problem with every one of these I've owned has been static cling - grounds stubbornly stick to the container. Depending on the roast and the weather, getting the grounds from the container to the filter basket almost always makes a mess. The Oxo container is stainless steel - no cling!\n\nA final word about Oxo the company. Their customer service is superb. I bought the grinder in November. In May I noticed it had developed a hum when not running. I called the company on June 3rd and on the 7th FedEx delivered a replacement to my door. Oxo supplied a prepaid label in an email to use for returning the defective machine. I can't speak to the ability of this grinder for espresso nor for French-press, but for a drip coffee maker I highly recommend it."

Amazon is taking care of me despite being outside the 30 day return window and sending a new one out right away. I will update this review if the new one survives more than a few months. The grinder was quiet, static free and a perfectly uniform grind. It suddenly stopped grinding the beans. The motor ran and the beans jumped around but no grinding occurred and it sounded \"stuck.\" I took it apart and cleaned all the parts that could be cleaned and shook out the half ground beans around the burr twice to no avail. I attempted to contact OXO and did not receive a response within the 24 -48 hour window as promised. Thank goodness for excellent customer service from Amazon as this item was not cheap! Hopefully it was a fluke and the new grinder will have a much longer life!"

The only reason it doesn\u2019t get five stars is the coarse grind is a little inconsistent but not a big deal. It could be that it just needs to be set to the proper setting.

Less than 1 month of coffee from a shop for the price of this grinder. Make America Brew at Home Again\n\nUPDATE: the grinds get stuck. I didn't realize this was an issue until I bought a scale. You have to bang the grinder on the bottom to get all the beans and grinds out and it's getting super annoying and precision is key. Maybe just spend your money on a good quality hand grinder."

Not so with the Oxo, the area around the grinder is clean after several ginds.\n\nAnother observation: the grounds are extremely uniform in size. With my last grinder, the grounds varied from near powder to course. The ground uniformity from the Oxo caught my eye right away.\n\nI have only had this a few weeks, so if it performs this well for at least a few years it's worth the 5 stars, especially in eliminating the mess that comes with some of the other grinders."

I nearly never have an issue.\nThe grinder is nice. We have had 2 previous grinders. As a non coffee drinking primary coffee maker in our house, I really like that I can push a button and walk away. And my husband liked that he can really set it to just how he wants his coffee ground. This might seem tedious and time consuming at first, but especially when combining with his technivorm moccamaster machine, he gets a very nice cup of coffee.\nAs far as noise goes, I find it to be very tolerable. A grinder is not going to be quiet, but it is quieter than our last two, plus being able to walk away makes it even easier to tolerate. I used to put towels under and around our old grinder to lessen the shock of the noise first thing in the morning, but this one really doesnt offend me at all.\nClean up is simple, and I have found that if I empty the hopper out well ( which is quick and easy to do) every other time I fill it I don't run into any issues with a clog or anything like that.\nVery happy with the grinder, was pricy for what we are used to paying for coffee accoutrements, but I was splurging on Christmas gifts."

The vast number of settings for how coarse or fine the grounds come out seems like overkill, but maybe for the coffee aficionado it\u2019s a great feature to have.\n\nSo the one issue that I had is with the stainless steel cup that catches the grounds. The folks that read instructions will see that there\u2019s supposed to be a \u201cclick\u201d sound when you put the cup in the unit. This keeps it in place during the vibration that occurs when the grinder is on. I\u2019ve seen a few people complain that the cup doesn\u2019t click into place and in turn slides out of place when in use. The one fix I tried and worked for me after I exchanged the first unit for the same problem was to bend back that metal trigger thing on the unit that pushes up against the cup. It seems that, out of the box, that piece pushes the cup back out too far so it can\u2019t lock into place. Bending it back slightly fixed that issue. Having said that, I tried to fix the first unit I received and the cup still didn\u2019t seem that secure. In this case, the plastic lid that goes over the cup didn\u2019t have enough of a ridge on it to lock into place properly. For that issue, you can either ask for a replacement unit to get what you paid for, which is a working unit, or you can jerry-rig it with a thick rubber band like I read someone else did.\n\nAll in all, I\u2019m happy now that I have a 100% working unit. I thought about knocking the rating down a star for the trouble, but Amazon customer service quickly sent out the replacement with no attitude and only continuous thanks and apologies for the hassle so I can let it slide.

Also I found the 30 sec setting not quite long enough for a large pot of coffee. After the second week things improved, the process cleaned up and the grind was such where it can do a full pot on 30 secs. I now find it a better grind then my previous burr which was a Cuisinart. So be patient, don't give up on her and hopefully you'll have similar results."

I purchased this grinder because it has a metal receptacle for the ground coffee that's grounded. One of the most maddening things about grinding your own coffee with a burr grinder is the static charge imparted on the coffee grounds. There is a grounding tab that touches the metal container, but it only 1/2 works. Not sure if it's due to grounds that get between the tab and the container or something else, but still have some flying grounds after grinding. So only 4 stars. But it is a nice, affordable, grinder if you're seeking a consistent grind and are a coffee lover."

I could never go back to that type of bitter tasting coffee. The flavor of the coffee with this machine is soooooo Delicioussss with smooth flavor/taste. Yes, it is necessary for you to keep tweaking the control knobs until you find the setting that produces the best coffee for your tastes.\n\nMy first step was to use a manual burr grinder. I Loved the flavor of the coffee that was produced by this method. Only thing, it takes quite awhile to grind 3 tablespoons of coffee, and cleaning it is time consuming, plus you need to remember how you took it apart, so you can put it back together successfully. So glad I decided to make the investment, and purchase this electric grinder!\n\nI never knew coffee could taste THIS delicious!"

The Breville has a button you repeatedly press to select the duration of the grind, and another button to initiate the grind, plus a dial that adjusts the grind from fine to course. The Breville's controls are more electronic but I've never had issues with them.\nThe Breville generates substantially less static cling to the grounds than the OXO.\n\nOverall, the Breville is a better grinder, but not by much, and the OXO is much less expensive."

It has lots of features which I would never want to give up as well. I'll never go back to pre-ground."

The brush helped, but didn't always clean it as well as we would like. The OXO grinder had a metal chamber so coffee never clings to it. We have had the OXO for 6 weeks now and it has held up like a champ. We grind large amounts of coffee twice daily and so far the OXO has been consistent and quick. It is much more quiet that the Mr. Coffee grinder too. Overall a great purchase!"

Makes a nice consistently sized grind, much improved. I use a medium grind (7) for drip filtered coffee and coarse (13-14) for my French press. Both come out excellently. So far no problems with the electric hum I read about in some reviews. Love this grinder!"

The machine is so easy to use, set the grind, press the button and you're done! Holds a full size bag of beans.

Part way through the grinding process, the machine clogged up entirely. I tried everything to clear it but no luck. I had to take everything apart, wash them all, and put it back together. The instructions say that \"old beans\" might clog the grinder, so i tried a brand new, unopened bag. The unit stopped due to overheating twice and when i had 1/4 of the bag left, clogged up again - no amount of coaxing or prodding could get it to restart. The instructions also say \"dark roast\" might clog the unit. So i guess to use this, i have to switch to smaller bags and a lighter roast - easier to switch to a different grinder (which i did)."

In contrast, the OXO has a metal collection cup which empties cleanly.

It's clogged up inside and there's no easy way to access the clogged part. And yes, I followed the instructions faithfully. This was a replacement for a cheaper Cuisinart grinder that lasted just shy of two years. How much do I have to spend to get one that works and doesn't quit? If there's a way to contact Oxo and discuss it with them I was unable to find it. I do not recommend this grinder."

A HUGE upgrade from my old Cuisinart which died after a decade. I've made coffee on two of the 15 settings and both times the coffee was ground on the money. I think OXO has hit a home run with this grinder!"

Too bad, because you have to empty the hopper and take apart the grinder to clear the jam. Drier beans run well, but I like the big taste of the oily roasts. Perfection may be out there, but this isn't it!"

The top hopper sort of clicks in place so i feel okay leaving a bunch of beans in there - rather than the Bodum which the cap just basically laid in place. AND its easier to clean.

I cleaned it out, made sure there were no blockages and then found that the lower burr was not spinning. The screw that you see sitting on top of the burr spins when plugged in and one of safety tabs depressed, but the burr itself doesn't spin. Apparently something must have broke in the shaft . Its one week past the date to return it back to amazon. I'll see if oxo warranty will replace it, but just thought I would post this now as a heads up to others."

The ground wire along with the stainless steel container has kept the grinds from clinging, which is caused by the static, and in turn keeps it much cleaner. As for the grounds, they are more consistent and much finer than the other machines I\u2019ve owned. Also, doesn\u2019t spit out grinds all over outlet counter top! I highly recommend this grinder!"

So you don't have to mess with it every day to get a consistent grind.\n\nThe only, minor, downside so far is that the timer doesn't quite go long enough for me. So when I want a full pot of strong coffee, I have to run twice at 20. When turned all the way up to 30, the canister is only about half full, so there's room for longer grinds.

            "reviewText": "I have the OXO coffee maker so I thought this would nicely match up with it and replace my manual burr grinder. It definitely gives a nice even grind but I hate to say that it has been pretty annoying to operate. I don't fill the hopper because I like to vary the type of bean I use from time to time, and instead want to grind only as much as I need at a time. The problem is that once you press the button, it runs for 1-2 seconds and then stops (update again because people seem to think that I don't know there's a timer: this happens with all timer settings - even to the max time). This continues until it gets a nice groove going and finally grinds all the beans. I'm happy with the grind size, but, for ~$100, I'd think OXO could do better.\n\nUpdate: The problem with it not grinding through the whole time is getting worse. Even more, it doesn't respond to the first 2-3 button presses to start grinding (and this is with a good amount of beans in the hopper). Likely to return (perhaps mine is a dud?) as there are grinders that can do the same job at this price range."

I've had no issues with it, and I feel like it does a great job grinding.\n\nNoise: It does make some noise, but no more than I anticipated. It's not obnoxious or anything- its maybe slitghtly more noisy than my blade grinder was.\n\nEase of use: Very easy to use--you choose your grind size and time and push the button. I've read about people having issues with the container coming out as it grinds, but I haven't had that issue. I do press it snugly in place. There isn't an actual 'click.' the container is metal, and there's a little metal bar that senses the containers place. The click is really just the sound of the two pieces of metal touching. It did take me a couple of days to figure out how many seconds I needed to grind for the amount of coffee I'm making. On my grinder it seems that it's about 4 to 5 seconds per cup of coffee.\n\nStatic: there is a little static, but not anymore than I anticipated. I never have coffee grounds all over the counter, but they will cling to the inside of the canister. I usually let it sit for a couple seconds after grinding and I don't have any issues.\n\nOverall I'm very pleased. It's what I expected from a mid-range grinder. A lot nicer than the crappy $30 ones you can buy, but maybe not as fancy as something that cost twice as much. I'm very happy with it and I highly recommend it!"

            "reviewText": "I bought this grinder from Amazon via a different listing that included a sample package of coffee. The grinder works, but not as well as the reviews appear to indicate.\n\nFirst, no matter how long you run the grinder, a few whole beans are left just above the grinder mechanism (hidden, you can't see them in the hopper). Second, some ground coffee is left inside the grinder---it falls out if you lift the whole thing up and slam it down several times on the counter, but otherwise it stays until the next use.\n\nThe net result is that when you grind coffee, it includes some stale material from the previous use. This is particularly a problem if you are grinding a small amount every day, say 2 cups, because the percentage of stale material is large."

            "reviewText": "I received this as an early birthday gift yesterday. I've been using a small Krups blade grinder for years. About a year ago I tried replacing it with a capresso infinity that out of the box did not want to register adjustments in grind size. So back to the Krups I went.\n\nI've been in search of the perfect burr grinder for a while now. As I'm sure you've noticed, there is no perfect grinder. They all have their quirks, drawbacks and issues. Being that the OXO just came out recently, I'll admit I was a tad skeptical. But I had seen others in the coffee industry comparing it and really talking up its quality and ability to kick It with some of the more expensive grinders out there.\n\nNow, if you're accustom to using a blade grinder and pulsing the blade, this will be much much different. There is a bit of a learning curve and adjustment period to dial in the proper grind size and timing the grind for the amount you need for each brew. I'd recommend using a cheaper coffee to go trough the initial setup process for the sake of not burning through a bag of specialty coffee.\n\n**When initially adjusting, you can dial in the grind size with no coffee in the hopper. Once coffee is in the hopper make sure to only adjust the grind size when you are grinding to prevent jamming the burrs!\n\nFor me, the perfect grind setting for a chemex/pourover brew is one tick over 11 between medium and coarse. I have a 10 cup chemex and typically brew about 24oz of coffee at a time. So I use approximately 42.5g off coffee which with the oxo is about a 13 second grind. Without getting too into the process I use 730g of water, with your typical 30-45 second bloom time and about a 4 to 4 1/2 minute brew time. You'll certainly be able to tell the difference in taste, consistency and brew time over a blade grinder.\n\nFor those asking or wondering if it's good for espresso, I have not tried this yet. I may not try it because I have another grinder specifically for espresso that works well enough for me not to fuss with adjusting the oxo to do the same.\n\nOne thing I will note about the \"anti static\" stainless container. It's certainly not anti static so to speak, but it is less static then plastic grind bins. If you let the ground coffee sit for a minute or two and give it a few taps it all mostly settles and pours out clean. Directly after a grind there are fines that cling to the sides and lid, but are not all that difficult to pour out with some patience.\n\nAs with most burr grinders there is some retention of beans in the shoot that don't make their way out. So you may have to give it a little tap to get all of your grounds out into the bin. Otherwise, they may end up on your counter. I'm not talking copious amounts of coffee will come pouring out. It's probably just a gram or two at best.\n\nThe OXO is also fairly quiet. I have no way of measuring the decibels. However, in comparison to a magic bullet blender, this thing whispers.\n\nOverall I'm impressed, it delivers where I really need it to. My primary intended use will be with pourovers like the chemex, and my aeropress. If I discover anything out of the ordinary or perhaps end up trying it out for espresso, I'll update my review!\n\n*Always make sure not to use over roasted, old or oily beans. They just don't do well with burr grinders. Much less, that's typically a sign that the coffee is bad. Shoot for matte beans that are as fresh as possible to avoid clogging the grinder and shoot!"

            "reviewText": "For a while now, I've wanted to try to make my own cold brew coffee at home. But in order to do so, you need coarsely ground coffee which is nearly impossible to achieve using one of those ubiqitous mini-grinders. I currently have two (Braun and Kitchenaid) and have had no luck regulating the type of grind. Not to mention that they only grind a small amount of coffee at a time, making the whole process extremely labor intensive. My local Stop n Shop used to have a large grinder for whole bean coffee, but they removed it ages ago (probably over sanitary and/or safety concerns). So it looks like my dreams of cold brewing at home are fading.\n\nThen I was offered the opportunity to try this OXO Conical Burr Coffee Grinder.\n\nThis is extremely intuitive and easy to use. I didn't even have to read the instructions. The clear plastic reservoir holds an entire 12 oz bag of coffee beans (the standard size sold by Starbucks, Eight O'Clock, Dunkin Donuts, etc.) and can grind the entire thing in no time. It can create anything from Coarse to Fine simply by turning a dial located directly beneath the reservoir of whole beans. You can set the grind time from one to thirty seconds after which it automatically shuts off. About eight thirty second increments will grind an entire bag. The stainless steel cup that catches the ground coffee needs to be emptied about halfway through the process.\n\nIt's very sleek and attractive and while it isn't absolutely enormous (only slightly narrower than a standard auto-drip coffee maker) it does take up counter space. Since it's not a gadget I'll be using everyday, I intend to stow it out of sight.\n\nBut most importantly of all, the flavor of coffee made from freshly ground beans is phenomenal. Both my husband and I can really taste the difference. I can't wait to make my own cold brew."

When I pour the grinds into my coffee maker the grinds just slide out. !!\nI LOVE THIS !!!\nThe other machine I had for a few years got clogged finally (I had changed to an oily roast of starbucks). and I didn't know what was wrong. So for all you people? your grinder WILL CLOG !! (esp if you have an oily roast). I\"m pretty sure they all do this.\nI like this machine better for two other reasons:\n1. It's much quieter.\n2. The size of the coffee grind is consistant (much more than the Cuisinart grinder. (It was a disk grinder, not a conical grinder)\nI've only had this for a week so it hasn't had time to break or get clogged. so that's my disclaimer."

            "reviewText": "Coffee is serious business in this household. Until purchasing this unit, I had been using a manual hand turned grinder every day because I found the process to be cathartic. Those days are over.\n\nI brew my coffee with a french press and notice big differences when making the most subtle changes to the grind size and amount used. This unit allows me to make very small changes to the coarseness settings and dial in the exact taste I want (the pictures show my perfect french press settings). The product has been very well thought out and works perfectly.\n\nInitially I wasn't sure how many seconds worth of coffee I needed so I took the amount I would normally use to brew a pot in the french press and dumped it into an empty hopper and timed how long the unit took to grind the entire amount. Turned out to be 13 seconds so that's what I set the timer to. Now I dump a full pound of coffee into the hopper and whenever I press the grind button I get the perfect amount. Since I go through about a pound a week I don't worry about storing the beans in the hopper since I use them quickly. You shouldn't store coffee in the unit for long periods because it is said it can affect the taste especially if it is exposed to sunlight. A week has been perfectly fine.\n\nNext I experimented with the coarseness and found just under a 14 setting to be the best for full flavor without bitterness when using my french press. Check the instructions if you are using other methods. I think this will be the correct setting for Chemex too. I haven't bothered inspecting the grinds for size consistency. To me, taste and consistency is what counts and this produces both.\n\nI don't bother cleaning my unit at all since I use it every day. Since the collection cup is made of stainless, static isn't an issue. I just give the cup a couple of taps and 99% of the grinds come out, or you can just give it a quick rinse after use. I don't bother and can't taste the difference.\n\nWhile there are cheaper units available, I wanted something that was quality since I use it every day. I rationalize spending a little more by saying it's something I use every day. I'm 100% pleased with my purchase."

The only problem might occur is to change the grind settings is a little stiff. Cleaning is easy as the coffee bin is easy to remove. There is very little static but there is a little cling at the very bottom of the cup that can be shaken/tapped to removed. I do like it and would recommend it.

            "reviewText": "This bin has a stainless steel bin to collect grinds, which eliminates the problem most grinders have because they have plastic bins that get charged with static electricity when the grinder runs, causing grinds to stick to the sides. That caused our old plastic-bin grinder to make a mess on the kitchen counter every time we pulled the bin out and tried to get grinds into our coffee maker's basket. The OXO has solved that. Plus, OXO's grinding is superior -- the motor runs quiet and smooth and the grind is finer than we had before. The OXO holds 3/4 pound of coffee beans, so we fill it about every 5-6 days. My only gripe is to make a 12-cup pot we have to run the grinding twice, since the timer's max setting doesn't grind enough. But most days we make less and setting it on max of 10 is sufficient."

            "reviewDate": "December 28, 2018",
            "reviewText": "\u00a0To be as blunt and simple as possible, the OXO BREW Conical Burr Grinder is the worst product I have ever purchased online through Amazon. Furthermore, my wife has been in contact via email with OXO's customer support team about the poor quality of this product, and their support team refuses to either refund or replace the product. We have provided them with both videos and photos showing that the unit functions either very poorly or does not function at all without lots of troubleshooting. Yet, their engineers have responded saying that the unit appears to be functioning \"normally\" in the videos (one of which I will attach to this review). However, at this point the unit does not work without quite a bit of frustration--plugging and unplugging multiple times or sweeping out the burrs multiple times just to grind enough beans for a pour over coffee. Even though I have only owned this unit for one month, I see no other solution than to place this unit in the trash and buy a more expensive unit from another manufacturer. I am an avid home coffee brewer, and I have owned other coffee products from Bonavita, Hario, Mr. Coffee, Cuisinart, and OXO. I can say unequivocally, this OXO burr grinder is the worst coffee product I have ever owned or purchased. I will attach video and photographic proof that the unit does not work correctly and will explain further below the problems with the unit.\n\nInitially, the unit worked great. For the first week, the unit produced a reliable and consistent grind of Trader Joe's Ethiopian beans (~$8.99 a bag). Then, the trouble started the second week when I began grinding Stumptown Hair Bender beans (~$15.99 a bag). The unit jammed mid-cycle for the first time. The button on the front of the unit would not start the motor so I tried troubleshooting the unit in multiple ways, following the instructions in the owner's manual. I unplugged it and plugged it back in--start button still did not work. I opened the bean hopper and nothing appeared jammed. So finally I opened up the burrs and swept them out. When I put the unit back together, it worked, and I thought the problem was solved. However, over the next week, the unit kept jamming every time I used it with the Stumptown beans. Sometimes it would jam multiple times in a row. Each time I had to open the unit and sweep out the burrs to get it to work. This process, while being extremely frustrating and time-consuming, also caused the unit to produce an inconsistent grind size. I've attached a picture showing that I get chunks of beans in my pour over because I have to play an elaborate game with the machine just to get it to function. For a unit that regularly retails for around $100, this is absolutely unacceptable for a new product. Furthermore, if a $100 burr grinder cannot be used on a premium product like Stumptown, then that grinder is entirely worthless to coffee enthusiasts.\n\nAfter I finished the bag of Stumptown coffee, I tried the grinder again on the Trader Joe's beans (since those beans had initially worked well with the unit). Now, I began experiencing the same problems with Trader Joe's. In order to grind 5 scoops of beans for one large pour over coffee, I had to either: (1) Open and sweep the burrs multiple times or (2) Plug and unplug the unit multiple times because it grinds for about 3 seconds before jamming even when the timer is set on 30 seconds. I have attached a video showing the unit functioning in this way. In the video, you will see the game I have to play just to grind beans using a unit that was purchased only 3 weeks prior.\n\nHere's my personal thought regarding the performance issues of the machine. I assume the motor has a fail-safe feature designed to stop the motor in event that it becomes clogged. This would prevent the motor from being damaged if a very small stone or an extremely hard bean got stuck in the burrs (which can happen on a rare occasion). My guess is that this setting isn't quite right in my unit and that the unit stops every time there is the tiniest bit of resistance on the motor. This would explain why I have to unplug the unit multiple times just to completely grind a cup of beans. Either way, it is entirely unreasonable for OXO to expect users to have to troubleshoot a new unit with such frequency as a part of the unit's \"normal\" functioning.\n\nCurrently, OXO does not want to address my concerns with this unit so I have decided to place this negative review. I've never felt compelled before to write a negative review on Amazon. Hopefully, they will decide to improve the product and respond to customer concerns. At this point, I cannot recommend this product to any other buyer, and I will no longer purchase any kitchen or coffee products manufactured by OXO. Finally, I've decided I don't even want a replacement for this unit. Even if OXO offered to replace it, I would refuse. That alone shows my level of disappointment with the product. The overall build quality feels cheap to me, especially the timer and start button on the front. I owned an entry-level Mr. Coffee burr grinder (~$30) for 7 years that \"felt\" better--button quality, weight of product, sound of motor, etc. If OXO decides to respond to my concerns, I will only accept a full refund for the purchase price of the product so that I can purchase another unit from a different manufacturer.\n\nUPDATE: OXO finally agreed to refund us the purchase price of the unit after I posted this negative review and video on Amazon. The refund process took some time, but we did eventually get a check in the mail for the full purchase price of the unit. We will explore other options for a replacement unit."

            "reviewText": "Pros:\nGood price, not too loud. I bought this grinder to replace my Cuisinart. It's a clear improvement from that machine. I balked at paying $200+ for a conical burr grinder, so was happy to find this more reasonably priced OXO model. It has a small footprint and isn't very loud.\n\nJust OK:\nThe grind range seems to be good. I use it primarily for french press, pour over, and drip machine, so haven't tested it at the smaller grind settings. The grind consistency isn't great but isn't bad either. You can see in the image that the grinder is less consistent at larger grind settings.\n\nCons:\nNot as easy to use as advertised and rather messy. There are three things I dislike about this machine: grind capacity, static cling, and spitting grounds out.\n\nIn terms of ease of use, OXO claims it has a \"One-touch start timer\" and \"Grounds container accommodates up to 110 grams (enough for 12 cups).\" While you can certainly turn the grinder on with one touch, it isn't possible to grind at or near maximum capacity with just one touch. You have to push the button twice because the longest grind duration of 30 seconds is insufficient. I can usually get 60-75g per button push at a medium grind (obviously this will vary some with bean type and grind size). This means I can't just turn the machine on and walk away while it grinds.\n\nIt's a messy grinder. The stainless steel receptacle doesn't sit flush with the machine. Even if you push the container back as far as possible, there's a gap where the grinder spits out grounds, making for a messy counter and wasted coffee beans.\n\nStatic cling: The stainless steel container/plastic lid combo creates static cling (despite OXO's claims to the contrary). This is the most frustrating part of this machine. The coffee grounds cling to the container, especially to the curved lip. The static cling is so bad that you can't just pour out the ground coffee onto a scale or into a brewing device, as I used to do with my previous grinder. I have to use a scoop to transfer ground coffee to a scale if I want to weigh out the right amount. Keeping the plastic lid on or taking it off doesn't make much of a difference. If I want to fill a pour over filter with ground coffee, I have to scoop the grounds a couple of times then tap the stainless steel cup to release the static cling and get the rest of the grounds to fall to the bottom of the container. This is a pain.\n\nAll in all, this grinder is a clear improvement on cheaper models but not nearly the level of performance I expected at this price point."

My only gripe is that the grounds container doesn't always stay put when grinding. It's a little finicky. Maybe I got an odd one? If not OXO should work on the design of that part a bit.\n\nOther than that, I'm happy. Not too loud for an electric grinder, and whatever anti-static measures they've taken seem to work well. Very few grounds stick to the cup and what does is probably more moisture related than anything.\n\nFresh ground coffee with the consistent sized grind of a conical burr is one of the best things you can do for your coffee. I'm using the same approximate amounts I was when using a whirling blade grinder, but my coffee is so much better, and no sludge. If the goal is \"wet sand\" the whirling blade grinder would give me a mix of powder and boulders. With this grinder everything is the same size, so I don't have some that's so fine it gets through the filter, or some that's so large it isn't extracted well. Even the crema looks better."

            "reviewText": "I finally replaced my junky Cuisinart DBM-8 with this OXO grinder. MAN what a difference! I've always been happy with OXO products, they seem to always have a higher level of quality than the rest of the mainstream consumer grade products. True to OXO, this is a quality product. Don't listen to the reviews that complain about only having a time setting for the grinder instead of an amount. Once you dial it in for your particular beans and pot, it's just a touch of one button. I literally hated the DBM-8, which is NOT a conical burr grinder. Instead, it uses 2 flat grinding wheels which are screwed into cheap plastic that will eventually break rendering the grinder useless. It also had a terrible problem with static in the coffee grounds making cleanup a major task. This OXO grinder has none of those problems and it's a joy to use. There is literally almost zero cleanup required. I also noticed a lot of people complained about the beans needing to be \"stirred\" to go through the grinder. That may be a problem with some of the super oily beans you get from like Costco, etc., but I don't use oily beans and haven't had this problem. I use a variety of beans, but mostly Trader Joe's French Roast as a daily go-to.\n\nI use an Aero Press and my recipe for that is: grind for 21 seconds on #5, 2 paper filters in the Aero Press pre-wetted, 75 ml water off-boil to bloom the grounds, then 250 ml water off-boil for 1 minute 30 seconds brew time, then 75 ml bypass water. Sounds complicated, but it's actually very easy. I did all the weighing of grounds/water early on, then just converted it so I don't have to weigh every time, which is a real pain."

It has all the features I wanted (timed grind, big hopper, nice metal grinds bin) and the price isn't bad. I upgraded from my baratza encore, which I loved just because the burrs are starting to dull and it's a few years old at this point. I've also had the rancillio rocky but it drove me nuts as it retained a ton of coffee in the chute. I feel like the overall components seem to be better quality than my old baratza. The disassembly is much simpler and I feel like the plastic parts surrounding the burrs are better quality so I'm happy. Another pretty cool thing to note is that my large beehouse dripper fits inside the grind chute so I can just hit the pre-timed button and it goes directly into my cone - pretty nice to not have to do everything twice. I'll update this review if anything changes after a few weeks of use\n\nUPDATE April 16 2019: I'm still very happy overall with the grind and use but I will say that my grinds bin doesn't stay in place like it should. It's not the end of the world to hold it in while grinding but the directions clearly state that you should be able to slide the bin in until you hear a \"click\" and it should remain in place...I can tell you that it doesn't so unless you want coffee everywhere, you need to hold it in. Otherwise, the grind is fantastic and consistent."

            "reviewText": "I have had this grinder for a couple of months now and it really does a good job of producing a consistent grind and is pretty quiet. Two issues. To remove the hopper, which I need to do every day to get it to fit in the cupboard, you need to remove the top of the hopper and fish through the beans to find the shaft that must be turned to remove it. The lock should be outside the hopper but short of that it should be longer so it is not buried in the beans when the hopper is full. With smaller beans, they can get lodged in the gates that close to seal the bottom when removing the hopper. Second is the timer. It turns freely with no detents to ensure it does not move when handling. I need to ensure it is set to the same time each use. It should have detents on the seconds so that at least it clicks into place and stays where you set it. Doesn't seem that a digital timer would have been a cost prohibitive feature on such a solid grinder. That said, at this price point it is a solid grinder that I would recommend."

No it\u2019s not perfect, yes beans will get stuck from time to time but I love it. I clean the lower and upper burr once a week, sometimes more using a bristle brush and gently tapping the whole grinder out over the sink. I stopped washing the the grounds container out each time with soap and water though, all I do is wipe it out with dry hands over the sink, it is silky smooth in design and there\u2019s just no need to wash it after each use. Just dry wipe and you\u2019re done. Fantastic buy.\n\nI have been making French press coffee for a few years now, and all the while using a standard blade grinder despite everything I\u2019ve read about the importance of grinding the beans. I just used this machine for the first time this morning and WOW. The ground beans looked COMPLETELY different then in my little blade grinder, and I thought I had that down to a science. I used a 13 on the course setting for 10 seconds and then manually ran it for another 2-3 seconds since all the beans had not been ground. I am completely embarrassed to say that the cup of coffee I had this morning was better then any cup I\u2019d had since I started using French press. I then added cream and sugar to another cup and even that tasted SO much smoother. I cannot believe how much better burr grinding is. As far as cleaning, and this is big for me with 5 kids running around, the parts are super easy to pop off. I will buy some small, soft bristle brushes for the burr areas though because The cleaning instruction recommend only cleaning them that way AND because I don\u2019t think there is a need to be getting the upper burr wet after each use. So basically those areas are super easy to clean because the bottom burr you can just run the machine with no beans and it really sweeps all the excess out and the upper burr cleaned with a small bristle brush over the sink or garbage is like new. To be honest I just gently tapped out the bean hopper because it doesn\u2019t get real dirty at all, maybe if you were grinding a ton of beans it would but I don\u2019t need much for French press so I\u2019ll deep clean that as needed. So all that\u2019s left is the grounds container and lid and that is so easy, I just rinse it with hot water & dish soap and set it to dry. My blade grinder I needed to clean pretty deep after each use so even though this has more parts it\u2019s actually way easier to clean if you ask me. As far as durability the burrs seem very durable, the whole machine seems quite sturdy, especially the bean hopper. The grounds container is light and the top just lightly clips on so that is probably the flimsiest thing that comes with this but I like it because it\u2019s light and super easy to clean."

I haven\u2019t yet dismantled the burr itself. I brush away the debris then run a 5 second grind . I clean the chute similarly upside down. I believe a weekly routine will help avoid any clogging is troubles. I haven\u2019t had the need to grind large amounts of coffee for a whole pot.

So I switched backed and forth between grinding beans in batch and buying ground bag of beans. Ground beans can't really compete with beans that are freshly ground just before brewing. I specifically searched products that are not going to break after a couple months use (one brand product went out of the picture even though I liked that design very much), and has a feature to preset grind amount. I normally brew same amount of coffee so when I get the water from the faucet, I can do it even without looking at it. Coffee amount is a different matter. Sometimes I scoop more, sometimes less. Sometimes I just pour from the bag and can't totally measure the amount. I wanted a machine that grinds a specific amount I preset. With one touch.\n\nThere are several products that do this, and OXO is in the middle of the pack in terms of price. I think other more expensive products have more delicate design to work with espresso portafilters. I don't have that need. This product's build quality and design really does not hurt the aesthetic landscape of my kitchen, and it does not take much space either.\n\nNow this is what I set for my use.\ngrind time = 10 seconds (for 2 full mug cups of coffee, with my coffee maker water line to 5).\ngrind setting = 10 (right side of medium)\n\nYes, it wasn't the 6 year old brewer. Now the coffee it makes comes with aroma. Now I can have it every morning at one touch. I can just empty the entire container once that 10 sec grind is finished into the filter and know it's a good amount (at least better than my eye measurement)."

Not a single piece of coffee has escaped in the 2 weeks I've had it so far. Very clean! My only complaint is the sticking beans in the hopper. All of the beans I grind are kind of oily and get hung up in the hopper. My solution has been to just pour in a little more beans than I want to grind. During the grinding, I usually have to stick in the provided scoop 2-3 times and stir the beans around to get them moving again. It seems to need less stirring as time goes by, though, as if the beans are lubing up the inside of the hopper and allowing for smoother movement. Ha! The Bodium was the same. When I first got it, it would hardly work at all with my oily beans. Eventually, it worked perfectly with them. I'm assuming this grinder will do the same.\n\nJust FYI, I set the grinder to the number 10 setting for a Moccamaster KBG coffee maker.\n\nI highly recommend this grinder! It's worth the price."

I do not use the timer feature since I weigh my coffee out each day and put it into the hopper, but the unit does auto-shutoff when the coffee is done grinding, even with the timer set to 30 seconds.\n\nI removed one star from my rating due to the very annoying electric hum the unit makes when not in use. It's not necessarily loud, but I can hear it if I am withing 5' of the grinder and everything else is quiet. I am in the habit of unplugging it when not in use because the hum was annoying enough while I sit and drink my coffee. I don't know what causes this, but I've read other reviews that mention the same thing."

            "reviewText": "I love OXO products and this move to larger kitchen appliances seems new to me but is entirely welcome. Unlike many I didn't really worry about the free product reviews (although I question their value aside from a very general trend prediction), as I would simply return it if it wasn't any good.\n\nBut this grinder turned out to be great. Just started using it so I don't know about durability and the like but bet it will be great. The only knocks I have are:\n\n1. The little collection cup is supposed to click in and stay in, but it doesn't (which is where I dropped a star). So you have to hold it in while the beans are grinding, but who wants to walk away when you are grinding coffee beans anyway?? It is a minor annoyance, but still an annoyance so can't give it five stars.\n\n2. The grinder grinds relatively finely, just as a recommendation to those other coffee fanatics. Easy to spot when you test the first grind. But my fine setting at the grocery grinders is about 11 out of 15 on this one. Not a big deal since it does grind the way I want it, but if you like it super coarse, this might not work as well.\n\nEnough about the negatives. This thing is sleek and feels well built and it doesn't take up much counter real estate, so you can likely leave it out and not have to pull it out each time you use it. It can grind to order or grind a few days worth at a time which is very nice. It also cleans easily. The hopper needs almost nothing and a quick tap of the collection cup clears most of the coffee out due to some sort of anti static coating. I really like this little gadget."

            "reviewText": "Ok, I just got this grinder today, so these are first impressions. I can't speak to durability. Like many of you, I used to own a Cusinart DLC-8. I have basically decided that it was a piece of junk and I never knew it. The Coffee that came out off the grinder was all different sizes, it probably ground too fast for a small burr grinder. I bought one back in 2006, and again around 2013, and this year it just quit. So it was time to buy another. Or was it?\n\nI didn't see why a coffee grinder should go bad so often. I was not using it past its duty cycle, it never got hot. My routine is that every couple of days I grind about 150 grams pic coffee, fine, to make 2 liters of cold brew coffee. I weigh the coffee, use ceramic pots with permanent filters, and give it overnight, stirring after at least an hour and perhaps as long as 3 hours.\n\nThe bin on the Cusinart held just enough for two pots. So I'd grind until the bin was full and then start weighing coffee.\n\nThe coffee I make at home is smooth, deep, strong, and far far better than any coffee I can buy at any shop. The Starbucks Nitro has some of the same characteristics but I would rather have what I make....because it just tastes better. I usually drink it black and iced, without sweetener or flavoring.\n\nBut I thought that coffee was supposed to be broken up buy a home grinder, and that the inconsistent grind was what I had to put up with to get a fresh grind.\n\nWow. I cleaned the new grinder, looked at how easy it was to disassemble, loaded it with beans, set it to fine and hit the button.\n\nThe ground coffee was all in the bin. It waa all uniform. ALL THE COFFEE WAS FINELY GROUND. There were no hunks, there was no powder. The grinder was just quieter. It sounded like an ordinary kitchen appliance rather than an airplane launching from the counter.\n\nI realized, at that moment, that I had been using what was an inconsistent machine. This was the grinder I had always wanted. Other reviews had talked about getting better coffee because the coffee is not being heated so much. I can't speak to that. My coffee from the DLC-8 was good. I think it was way harder to deal with because out was so inconsistent.\n\nRight now I'm ecstatic. If anything changes, I will post an update.\n\nI will say one thing. People are irritated because the grinder is not marked in cups. I ground some coffee on fine, it produced about 10 grams of fine coffee in 15 sec. When I changed it to medium coarse and ground for the same time, it produced a totally different amount of coffee. So it does not make any sense to make coffee that way. You need to calibrate your coffee and your fine or coarse grind to the number of seconds of grind you need. It seemed to be linear.\n\nAnd there are multiple warnings not to overkill the hopper. That is a real problem, but I am willing to watch the hopper so as not mess it up."

But it doesn't have the quality I would expect from $100 grinder. Also, it's plastic cover as well as the cover on top of the machine, are just a bit difficult to place, but come off really easy. It should be the opposite. I didn't even grind beans, because I wanted Amazon to be able to sell it as new, since I knew I wasn't going to keep it. I was SOLD a promo copy, but that's something I can live with. I already have the capresso cone burr grinder, that I bought maybe 10 years ago, and is still available. It is great! I just wanted to try a new grinder and ended up purchasing the very simple and effective Krups blade grinder https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B00004SPEU?psc=1&ref=yo_pop_mb_yo_pop_mb_pd_t2\nIf you shake it like a cocktail shaker while grinding the coffee, which is really easy because of its design, I got perfectly even grind for a Melitta filter. The coffee tasted great, less bitter than the coffee brewd using the medium fine ground coffee prepared with the Capresso burr grinder, richer and more flavorful, but more bitter. of course the Capresso produces better evenly growned course coffee for French press, or extra fine grinds, vor Espresso. Still, the simple little Krups machine is really nice and well worth buying for $20. But if you're going to spend $100, get the fantastic and durable and well-designed Capresso cone grinder."

            "reviewDate": "February 2, 2019",
            "reviewText": "I did some researching before purchasing this grinder. The inspiration was my friend gifted me a very nice bag of coffee for the holidays, but of course it was whole bean (which is the best, but I hadn't gotten around to getting the system set up). I had a hand grinder that I used and enjoyed, but I decided it was time to treat myself to a nice grinder. I'm so glad I did. It's a complete game changer and has really opened up my morning coffee routine.\n\nSo to sum up my thoughts on this grinder: I'm so glad I picked this one. I think it's the most attractive visually, I love the satin finish, and I think aesthetically it looks like something 3x the price. I love the variety of the grind and the ease of use. And while it's not sneak past your toddler in a small home quiet, it is very reasonable. If I were to do this whole process over again, I would probably buy the Oxo version with the scale. I really thought I would never use a scale and thats just completely more than I would ever need (and I don't know, maybe it's not worth the extra $100) but I also didn't realize how many more new coffees I would be trying now that they all taste so much better! I would keep a little note pad with my favorite roasts and their best amounts used. I have not needed to clean the burrs on this grinder yet so I don't have an opinion on that specifically but it's easy to clean the grinds off otherwise. And I really like that it's a no spill hopper. The top is easy to take off. I suggest getting a bristle coffee grounds brush to help keep the machine clean.\n\nSo, the cons. There's not very many of them but if I could change anything about this grinder, I would make it so the grounds catcher snaps in better. Sometimes it vibrates outwards when grinding so I have to hold it to keep it in place. I noticed the other Oxo grinder seems to have a better grounds catcher - it grinds into the middle instead of the side, further removing the possibility of your grinds falling outside of the catcher. And while on the subject of the grounds catcher, they could have chosen a nicer top for it (they appear to have done so on the scale version). I dropped mine the other day and worried it was going to snap when falling four feet. Lastly, the hopper only holds .75 a pound of coffee. I don't understand why they didn't make it so it just holds a pound? It's minor, but a 1 lb bag of coffee is probably the most common and I would like to store the entire bag in the hopper at once to try and keep it freshest.\n\nBut as far as functionality this grinder is excellent. It's solid, it doesn't feel cheap, it's not too loud. it grinds great coffee. The hopper even has a UV tint to help protect the beans. I don't know that the more expensive coffee grinders have anything on this one, besides a few quirks I mentioned above. If you're thinking of treating yourself to a nice coffee grinder, I think that this is a great entry level one and you will probably not ever need anything more. Consider splurging on the scale version if you think you will be varying the roasts or value real consistency though."

I've gone through percolators and french presses and pour overs and automatic espresso machines in search of a cup that meets my two criteria for great weekend coffee; easy and delicious. I've come to one conclusion... it's all in the grinder.\n\nPeople go on and on about pour over this and paper filter that, and inverted boiling systems, and temperature controlled units... that's great if you're a professional barista, for the rest of us, just trying to relax on a lazy Sunday, it doesn't matter, or at least it doesn't matter half as much as you've been led to believe. The number one thing standing between you and a great cup of coffee is your grind. Study it, experiment with it, get to know it and then make adjustments when you need to. The right grind can alter the flavor of your brew from sour and weak to rich and flavorful whether your beans cost $5 or $20. The trick is finding the best grind that works for you. This is the perfect entry level machine to that goal. It can't make terrible beans taste great, but it can make them the best that they can be.\n\nMy advice is take a couple weeks to dial it in. Buy a bag of roast that you like and drink only that roast for a couple weeks. Brew it using the same method every-time altering only the grind quality and try to make observations about what changed. Not every roast requires the same grind to shine, but little changes can sometimes go a very long way. It's an interesting way to study coffee, and to get great brews with relatively limited effort... or you know, just stick it on 6 and hope for the best.\n\nAfter a year of ownership, it still does the job like the day I got it. This is the machine you want; conical burr, slow grind rate, consistent as a swiss clock. The only thing that would make it better is ceramic burrs (supposedly), this one uses metal... I'll hold my breath.\n\nGrinds from this machine go into a cheap auto-drip every Saturday/Sunday and the coffee that comes out is consistently great despite that. The grinder itself is reasonably well built and handsome but there are some short comings.\n\nThe buttons aren't satisfying to press and OXO used surprisingly cheap plastics in places that you're routinely in contact with; on the start button, on the front face plate. That said, for $100 you're getting a machine that's reliable, consistent, and not too bulky or shabby looking. On too early Sundays, with upset children blaring demands at me like they're at a metal concert, it's exactly what I need to start my day."

The coarseness settings work well, and I'd argue the coarsest setting is perfect if you're using this grinder with Oxo's own (excellent) cold brew machine. It is quiet and, importantly, holds just enough beans to do a full cold brew batch - 284 grams of beans fit into the hopper with just a touch of room to spare. There is also considerably less static contributing to grounds flyaway versus competing grinders.\n\nThere are a couple issues, though. First, if you want to grind the entire hopper at once because you're following Oxo's cold brew recipe, you'll have to punch the button at least 4 times. Second, if you're doing that, you'll either need to empty the container after each grind, resulting in an increase in static and associated flyaway mess, or rig something that allows you to grind directly into your vessel of choice. For me, that vessel is Oxo's own cold brew carafe. The carafe is far too large to fit under the grinder, so I'm forced to prop the grinder atop some tupperware and use a flexible cutting board to funnel the grounds into the carafe. Functional, but certainly not elegant.\n\nIt's a bummer that Oxo's products don't interface well with each other, even though they're almost universally excellent standalone tools."

I have an OXO 9-Cup coffee maker, which brews a delicious pot of coffee, but I've always used a $20 Cuisinart grinder for my beans. I hated how irregular the grind was -- some parts were fine like espresso, but mixed in with pea-sized half-pulverized beans. The coffee was thus pretty inconsistent in taste. At times it was over-extracted and bitter, other times watery and weak.\n\nI jumped on the OXO when I saw it on sale. Wirecutter recommended it, and after using it for a couple weeks now I can see why. It's dead simple to set up and use. The first time you do it you should weigh your beans before and after you grind because you have to turn a dial to indicate how many seconds you want the grind to be. I wasn't sure if 10 seconds = 6 cups of coffee or 2 cups of coffee, and there's no way to really tell. I found 10 seconds at medium grind (5 out of 10) perfect for my 20 oz. coffee every morning. On weekends I increase it if I have more than 1 cup.\n\nOverall if you're even a little bit interested in having \"good\" coffee in the morning rather than just instant/cheap drip coffee, this is something you should seriously consider. Why waste money on a coffee maker and good beans if you're going to grind it poorly?"

I got my first choice, but was VERY disappointed in its inability to come close to a coarse grind, and sent it back.\n\nThis grinder was my second choice; not because I didn't think it would be as good as the first, but it was $40 more expensive. Well, as usual, I found that you get what you pay for. This grinder is everything I had hoped for and more. It grinds coarse and ever \"super\" course. For cold brew coffee this one can not be beat. Medium is medium, medium-fine is fine, fine is fine, and the in between settings are accurate and easily reproducible. All of my grinds have been very uniform.\n\nThere is minimal static stick, and what there is can be removed with a sharp wrap on the counter once the grind is gone. Static is NOT a problem! The noise level is very low and grinding speed is fast. Fit and finish are excellent. I have absolutely no complaints about this grinder.\n\nI know there are more expensive grinders, and MUCH more expensive grinders on the market, but I can't believe more money would give me an any better grinder than this one.

The parts that need regular cleaning can disassemble easily without having to empty the bean hopper first.\nSomebody who actually uses a grinder designed this.\nThis is a marked improvement over lesser grinders without costing hundreds."

It's quieter and cleaner than my last grinder, which was a no-frills Black & Decker. I use it exclusively for French press (very coarse grind), and it does that job great.\n\nI have one persistent complaint, and one maybe-not-persistent complaint. The first is that the dial to set the grind time is too loose, mechanically. Since it is located immediately surrounding the grind button, it's extremely easy to change the grind time accidentally. Then I grind my next batch and get a completely unexpected amount. I've learned to be cautious, but this is a small design flaw.\n\nThe other is what just happened to me for the first time. I assumed that, like most grinders, it would refuse to grind if the receptacle is not securely in place. Mine was completely missing (because I hadn't had my coffee yet), and the grinder happily dumped a full load all over my counter. I can't tell from the description here or from the manual whether this safety feature is supposed to be there, so I don't know if this was a malfunction. Is there an OXO rep that would care to comment?"

After upgrading to the conical Burr grinder, it's hard to imagine going back.\n\nAside from a noticeablely upgraded flavor profile from the same beans we were using with the blade grinder, it's so convenient to have the bean storage on the machine.

The ability to set the timer allows me to grind the perfect amount for a shot of espresso every single time - and I don't have to slave away at a manual burr grinder for 5 minutes. My morning routine will go much more quickly with this, and since I get a more consistent grind than the manual burr grinder can achieve, my shots of espresso have more crema, more flavor, and are in general smoother than they were previously. Well worth the $100. My one complaint is when you grind finely for espresso, there definitely is some static electricity buildup in the beans, causing them to stick to the stainless steel can which the grinds drop into."

I realized it was clogged with ground coffee just below the burr grinder where it passes through a small opening to get to the basket. I took off the hopper and the removable part of the burr grinder and cleaned it out and it worked great again.\n\nI thought at first if this happened every few weeks, it's not so bad to clean out the grinder now and then. Unfortunately it started happening more often. Recently it was every week, and finally today I am unable to get it to work---it clogs immediately even after I clean all the grinds out. I am beyond frustrated and will be contacting OXO on Monday (we are past the Amazon return window).\n\nSave yourself the headache and get something else. We had a Kitchenaid conical burr grinder for 7 years before this, and it never clogged. Finally the motor seemed to die, so we purchased the OXO grinder.

The bean storage compartment has a reasonably tight fitting lid to help keep the coffee beans fresh. Like all coffee grinders, static causes some of the grounds to stick to the dispensing cup, but the grounded metal cup minimizes this problem greatly compared to other grinders with a plastic cup. I like the ease of adjustment for the grind coarseness and the grinding timer that determines the amount of coffee that you grind. Both controls are simple, intuitive, and easy to set. My only minor complaint is the grind time adjustment knob turns too easily and thus is easy to accidentally change if you bump it. I would prefer a control knob that has detents or more friction so that it takes more deliberate action to turn it."

This may seem trivial, but it has saved a ton of mess on my counter...the bin that it grinds into has an opening on the top, so you can just pour what you need into the French press...or whatever you are using. Previous grinders had a lid I would have to take off to pour the ground coffee...and bean dust (yah, I am sure there is a better word for it) would go all over the counter.

Some things I like about this over the blade grinder: 1) We brew coffee 2 different ways in our house - with a blade, you just have 1 grind, now we can grind for the method and it does definitely make a difference in taste. 2) I love how you can just pour a whole bag of beans into the unit and not have to worry about it for a week or two - during that time, you just press a button to grind the amount that you need. Also, there are many other much more expensive burr grinders out there - we're not coffee aficionados and didn't want to pay a premium for features that we may not appreciate. Bottom line - this was reasonably priced upgrade from a blade grinder and the improvement in taste and ease of use was definitely worth it."

I subsequently discovered that the coupling between the motor and the lower burr was disengaged. Moving the motor higher, and manually rotating its body to lock its position, addressed this issue.\nThe lowest setting grinds were initially larger than what my manual Hario mill produces, but undoing a little the screw holding the lower burr addressed, I think, this issue, by allowing the two burrs to get closer together. That managed to improve grind size and uniformity, which is now slightly better than my old Hario.\nTo sum up, decent results, but only after addressing the issues mentioned. After approximately two weeks of everyday use, the results are satisfactory, and the timer feature is extremely useful, allowing to grind just enough coffee every time. The machine is relatively clean to operate, not too noisy, and doesn't seem to generate a lot of static charge. I feel however, that the grinder should provide finer grinds, and incorporate maybe a way to finely calibrate the low end of the grind size."

The hopper holds more and we can fill it once and grind for a week before having to fill it again. The dial for adjusting the amount is really nice and then you just push the button, unlike the Capresso which was activated by a timer that you turned and then ticked back to zero kind of like an egg timer. This has highly adjustable grind settings, no complaints there.

It was also harder to adjust the amount of coffee to grind each time. The Oxo took care of all those problems, quieter, more adjustable for grind & for quantity, much cleaner. It also takes up less space on the counter so I use it conveniently every day, just grinding enough for each pot. I think this device is a great value."

With the Oxo, it holds coffee beans in a hopper. You select the number of seconds you want it to grind. Then you press the button and the perfect amount grinds every time. After a little experimenting with how coarse or fine you want the grind setting and how many seconds to set the grinder to run to get your desired amount of coffee to grind per cup, you are ready to grind with one push of the button. It could not be easier. Great moderate priced grinder with the great Oxo name. I highly recommend this product."

Emptying the catcher into your brew basket is also messy, likely due to static, and it's impossible to get all the grounds out of the catcher unless you're knocking them out in the sink (wasted coffee, not much, but still).\n\nSo now I've got coffee grounds on my counter, on my coffee maker, and in my sink. I don't remember having this problem with my cheap Mr. Coffee burr grinder.\n\nI don't recommend this grinder. OXO can do better."

I read some reviews on this grinder and their seems to be two problems that pop up. Grinder cup not clicking into place and coffee bean jams. Well to date I have had no coffee bean jams. In addition when I put the grinder cup on there is a very low click and the cup locks in place very securely. Machine works better than any other low to mid price coffee grinder I had in the past. I at this point am very well pleased with the brain coffee machine and the grinder"

It has 16 grind choices from powder to coarse, and the ability to determine how much coffee to grind per pot by varying the number of seconds to dispense your beans into the grinder. The dials make it easy to set and repeat your choices. And the big, easy to empty stainless cup is ideal; even when the room's air is very dry creating static, it brushes out cleanly. I also like its compact footprint. I highly recommend this product for serious coffee lovers."

Based on 19c/kwh (in CA) you can expect it to cost $1.66 per year when idle.\n- It makes a slight buzzing noise when not in use, similar to a flourescent light tube.

However, some of the finest grind settings will cause the burrs to contact each other, creating metal shavings and damage to the burrs. On my grinder, setting 4 is the finest setting that can be achieved (which is extremely fine on my unit). I may contact OXO to see if there is a way to adjust the settings to ensure a full range of grind sizes are available (as my unit may not be able to effective perform the coarsest grinds."

Well, the same thing happen to the OXO grinder! So, I'm not sure I have gain anything with my $100 purchasel. But, this is my mistake for not looking more closely as to what I was purchasing. What do I like? The grinder is quiet. Holds more coffee in the hopper. Static is not an issue as with the plastic Starbucks ground container. When registering, you won't find this product in the OXO list, but rather the $200 grinder."

            "reviewText": "This OXO On burr grinder is tall so it has a small footprint, a plus when counter space is limited. The hopper holds a full pound of beans while my current unit only holds 3/4 pound. There are ample selections (15 choices) between fine and coarse (turn the hopper to select) to accommodate any taste or coffee brewing technique from fine for espresso, medium for automatic drip to coarse for French press.\n\nMy last burr grinder is a popular model made by a company with a name that starts with the letter C. The other has served me well but this one is superior in a number of ways but most importantly in sound level during grinding. My old model is deafening to the point that I usually leave the kitchen while it is operating. This just can\u2019t be good for hearing long-term. The OXO operates quietly--a world of difference.\n\nOther pluses with this unit\u2014the bean hopper is made of tinted UV plastic to protect the coffee beans from light. The brushed stainless steel housing is fingerprint resistant and the grounds do not adhere to the sides of the stainless steel grounds container like they do with the plastic receptacle on my previous machine.\n\nQuantity is selected by time between 10 and 30 seconds chosen by turning the OXO dial. It is suggested that to determine amount of grounds needed start using the 10 second selection and measure the output, etc.\n\nI ran the test on medium grind using the included coffee scoop which holds approximately two scant tablespoons. At 10 seconds roughly two scoops were created, 20 seconds 5 scoops and 30 seconds 8 scoops. This is offered as a general guideline and may vary.\n\nThere is a clearly written Instruction book included but operation is straightforward just be sure not to overfill the grounds container because it can back-up in the grinding shoot and burn out the motor. If the bean hopper empties before it finishes grinding just press the OXO button on the timing dial to stop the motor.\n\nThe heavy-duty cord is about 38 inches long and has a three-prong plug. A comparable extension cord may be used if needed. The motor has overheating protection so it automatically turns-off. Excellent unit with user-friendly features."

However, when the mood strikes me, I will hand grind beans in a ceramic conical burr grinder to fill nespresso capsules (because despite what Nestle tells you I have no idea what's actually in those pods) or K-cup pods since I'm too cheap to regularly buy at retail prices. I understand the potential differences in particle uniformity associated with use of steel blades or ceramic, conical burr as opposed to flat, the possibility of heating in the grinding process, static and all the other buzz words and phrases. What it devolves to is, at 6:30am I really don't care all that much and if the grinder in the Cuisinart hadn't stopped working I probably wouldn't be posting on this product page.\n\nThis is a very good machine for those of us who don't have to have the absolute best and it is definitively less labor intensive than cranking a hand grinder for 5 minutes to get enough grinds for a single 8 oz cup. It has 15 grind settings from very fine to coarse, has a one touch adjustable timer setting for up to 30 seconds per grind, a convenient steel container for collection of product and will accept up to one pound of beans in the UV protective hopper. It employs steel blades and is relatively easy for cleaning and maintenance. For those who demand precise measurements, unfortunately it does not have an integrated scale.\n\nAre there better machines? Absolutely, however for most coffee drinkers who prefer to use whole beans, I'm confident this model will do just fine."

            "reviewText": "I was pleasantly surprised by this grinder. I have a less expensive burr grinder that does the job. But like many grinders, my old one pushes the grounds horizontally out of a chute. The grounds fall into an all plastic container. There are two problems with that. When you remove the plastic container, some of grounds inevitably fall out, each time adding to a growing mess of grounds that ends up all over the counter. Also, grinding causes the grounds to become statically charged and they stick to the plastic container.\n\nThis grinder uses a metal collector with a plastic lid. The grounds don't stick to the metal. Also, the grounds drop straight down from a vertical chute. No mess from spillage and no mess from static cling. I'm really happy that this machine does not make a mess on the counter top.\n\nThe grinder is simple to understand, adjust, and use. But the real kicker is that it is relatively quiet. My old grinder left no doubt that it was working, as it made a loud grinding sound. This one makes a much softer sound. It was so quiet relative to my old grinder, that I thought maybe the beans were stuck and the grinder was \"spinning its wheels\". I turned it off to prevent damage, but to my surprise, it was functioning perfectly. The grounds were in the container.\n\nIf you are looking for a burr coffee grinder, I highly recommend this one."

For those aficionados who insist on the very best and can swill some coffee and tell you the bush it came from, the cost can go far, far higher. And even then there were reviews about static cling, beans jamming, etc.\n\nI simply wanted to grind my own beans for a decent cup of coffee each morning. This $100. grinder works great. In the months I have had it I have never experienced a jam or problem of any kind. It might not have the super fine separation of hundreds of different grind settings some folks want (it has 15 though) and I have no idea if it will grind fine enough for espresso, but for grinding coffee I fail to see the downside. It has conical burrs and you just set the timer and press go. At first I just tried different times and then used a measuring spoon to make sure I had the correct amount of coffee I needed. Soon I could just set a particular time and I was good to go with no further measuring needed.\n\nNow, please be aware that this grinder does not have burrs coated in unicorn dust like the machines costing up to $1000 and if your life revolves around pulling that perfect espresso shot, you may want to look elsewhere. But for most \"normal\" people, this machine will work just fine."

Although it delivers a great grind, it does it slowly. For 80 - 90 grams of ground coffee, it\u2019s going to take the full 30 seconds on the timer and then some. From what I understand, slow isn\u2019t necessarily bad when it comes to grinding coffee. I like the fact that you can remove the hopper with beans still in it. In case you want to empty out the hopper and fill it with an exact measured amount of beans, or if you need to clean the unit. My old grinder didn\u2019t do that and I had to turn the entire unit upside down to empty the hopper."

            "reviewText": "I must admit that since I could not find a \"discount\" price on this grinder I bought it from the place that always offers 20% off discount coupons. I consider this an amazing price for a grinder that so far (one month) does a great job compared to the manual, ceramic burr grinder it replaced. Even at the full price it's still a good buy compared to the prices for other conical steel burr grinders. I have been using both medium roast and the oily, dark roast beans without any problems. I have not tried espresso or french press grinds since I use either my Aeropress for single cups and regular drip grind for larger pots.\n\nSince I measure the weight of beans I need before I put them in the grinder, I set it to grind for 20 seconds, and either press the grind button multiple times to finish grinding or press to stop early if I'm grinding only 20-25 grams for a single serving. I do find that if I tap the body of the grinder and then turn it on for just an additional second I get the final bit of coffee out of it.\n\nI've cleaned the unit once a week by removing the outer burr, which just takes a twist to remove, and brushing out any partially ground beans that remain. Takes just a minute.\n\nThe stainless steel grind cup really is antistatic. After dumping out the grounds, I only have to tap a few times on the side to release the few remaining grounds. Much, much better than an old grinder with a plastic cup I had many years ago.\n\nI really like the way Oxo designs their products. The coffee scoop included with this unit is shaped like a shovel, which makes it very easy to add coffee bit by bit either before grinding the beans or after they have been ground. I had another grinder that came with a conical scoop that is more difficult to use when adding the last few beans or ground coffee to get to just the right reading on my digital scale.\n\nOne more shout out to Oxo. They get 6 or 7 stars for customer service. Before I bought this unit I called their customer service to find out if I could get replacement burrs. The phone rep. took my name and address and then apologized for the burr not working and said they would ship me out a replacement right away. I told her it was just a pre-sales information call, but I got a replacement burr in the mail anyway. Thanks Oxo!"

So far I went thru 5-6 pounds of it, and was generally satisfied.\n\nThe grind is mostly consistent. It is not a \"high end\" device, however as can be seen from the attached photo it gives nice results at different coarseness settings. The only thing I would have asked for would be a \"0\" level for Turkish coffee. The lowest \"1\" is good for espresso.\n\nThere are two settings on the device. First the mentioned coarseness, and I found 2 worked best for Aeropress, and 1 for espresso. The second is the timer, allowing a consistent output volume. (It is based on time, not directly volume though, so grind size also affects it. The photos shows this as well). For a reference, I was getting ~15 grams of level \"1\" espresso at 12 seconds.\n\nFinally, the cleaning is also easy. However make sure you put everything back tightly. Otherwise it does not work right, and it is very noticeable. If this were to happen, just remove the bin and the metal grinder, and reattach again."

The answer is that the grind is very good - I put about a quarter cup of medium grind though two strainers, large and small hole, and the too-large pieces were negligible, while the too-fine pieces were about a tablespoon's worth. See picture.\n\n- Is it cleanable? Mostly. Both hoppers are hand washable, but the instruction have warnings about using any kind of liquid to clean the chute and the two burr plates. I may take a screwdriver to the guts anyway, inasmuch as I really want to periodically deep clean my burrs.\n\n- Is it easy to use? The grinder is utterly intuitive. Choose grind, choose time, push button. If you do basically the same grind every morning you will quickly fine tune both of those settings. My one beef here is that the grind is selected by rotating the entire top hopper. I'm sure someone thought that this was clever, but if you have any kind of grip issues this is problematic (and OXO should know better).\n\nPretty good. 4.5 stars."

I won't dock this machine, as I didn't expect this to replace a $400 specialty grinder.\n\nI've had great results with drop coffee and cold press (using a French press). I like the tall format, which should still fit under most cabinets."

The grounds container does not make a mess and the material is not too prone to fingerprints. The top bean container has a wide mouth with a lid that stays in place without any vibrating noises when in use. The controls are super intuitive and the sound level is not bad. In short, a very well designed machine for everyday use.\n\nOne of the weaknesses of many coffee grinders in this price range is the espresso grind being too large. The cheapest blender style grinders can do it if left for around 3-4 minutes, but by then the coffee is hot and has a burnt bitter flavor. On the finest setting, this OXO grinder gives an ideal texture with no burnt or bruised flavor at all.\n\nI sometimes like OXO products and other times find them junky. This is my favorite one, and possibly the best grinder around for the price."

I put a few ounces of beans in the hopper and plugged it in.\n\nIN USE\nYou rotate the hopper to select a grind (the adjustment is very fine, so you should have no problem finding a grind you like). I set it to '6' for pour-over coffee. Then you set the dial to the number of seconds of grinding you want and press the button (if you need to, you can stop it grinding by pressing the button again). It grinds fast, about 1 gram per second at the '6' setting. I use 17 grams (3 scoops) for my morning coffee, so I set it to 17 seconds. The grind looks very consistent, and so far, the coffee we've made has tasted excellent.\n\nI'd prefer not to store my beans in the hopper, so I'd love to know if I can measure my three scoops into the empty hopper and grind them, but the manual doesn't mention whether you can use the unit this way. It could be bad for the burr to grind until it's empty every time."

            "reviewText": "I've been using the grinder for quite a while now, making coffee daily at the office with a wide variety of coffees. First, the static electricity problem is extremely minor. A little coffee sticks to the metal cup, but can easily be cleaned out. The grinder works every time and has not clogged yet. I have it set for 20 seconds to make 8 standard cups of coffee at a medium fine setting. If you use a really fine setting, the grinding time increases a lot. A really coarse setting does not make very good coffee for a drip maker with a paper filter. I just read other people's reviews, since I was thinking of buying a second grinder, and am surprised at some of the reviews compared to my experience. This suggests a quality control issue in manufacturing, with some very good and others flawed. I do not know about the manufacturer's exchange policy, but at $99, I would find out if I got a bad one. So far, I am very happy after months of use.\n\nEasy to set up. But, it takes a few tries to calibrate. This is because it uses a timer for grinding. The solution is to put the regular number scoops that you have been using into the hopper at the top, set the timer for 20 seconds or longer, and time it with a watch or cell phone. Next time, you can fill the hopper and use the same time that you measured. This should do it. Operation is easy. Set the grind. I recommend fine grind for most methods of making coffee that use a paper filter. You will have to periodically clean out the steel cup, since coffee will stick to it If you change coffee type, you will have to re-calibrate. Day 3: I am close to calibrating the timer vs grind fineness to grind the proper amount of coffee."

I have owned both blade and burr grinders and this is by far the nicest one. And it is also very attractive looking. It is tall but has a small footprint. I do not have a lot of spare real estate on my counter top but was able to fit this in nicely.\n\nIt is easy to operate. Drop the beans in the hopper, set the timer and grind, and press the button. The grounds drop into a metal container. My old machine had a plastic container and when I would open it static would make the beans go everywhere. That does not happen with this machine. Almost no mess! I tested several type of beans and dark, oily ones have no mess; drier ones will have a very small amount of static.\n\nIt may take a few attempts to find the right grind, but there are a wide variety of settings, everything from espresso to French Press with 15 settings in all. I tested several different settings and they all produced a consistent grind.\n\nAnd finally, this grinder is quiet. Very quiet. It won't wake up the household if you are the first person up and making the coffee.\n\nA big 5 stars from me. And not just because I got it to test it, but because I love it!"

One of my favorite features is that you can keep the time set, and then you just push the center button to run it for that duration. That means that if you brew the same amount of coffee everyday, all you need to do is push the grind button when your'e ready; no loading beans, no setting the time, and it's ready to go."

            "reviewText": "I received this item to try and review. I am a big fan of Oxo products so I was excited to see this.\n\nMy family has been using a grinder for many years that has lasted well. Initially when seeing this I thought this was not going to be a great contribution to making coffee at home. However, after trying this, I swear I can taste a difference.\n\n1. What's in the box?: You receive the item, plus instructions and a measuring scoop (which I like is made of pretty substantial plastic).\n\n2. Aesthetic?: well, this looks like a coffee maker. But of course this is a grinder (and personally I like the two separate since you aren't tied into one system as the grinder should last a lot longer). Here, the stainless steel (okay plastic color) is a nice touch and this looks spiffy. The buttons and everything else have a nice look and feel.\n\n3. Use? This has an interesting way to change the grind in that you turn the grinder hopper to the desired grind (I love this!) from denser to lighter depending on the desired grind and personal preference. Then you choose the time needed, which will also depend on the amount of beans in the hopper (this takes some getting use to and isn't intuitive). From there you press the button and this grinds to the desired status into a stainless steel hopper and the coffee is ready to be placed into the machine. This couldn't be easier. Given out older traditional grinder this dines't require any real effort and the coffee is evenly ground.\n\nThe instructions do say that this isn't for a long term storage of beans and I think thats is true since the system isn't closed to the air. But really given the size (and this is about the size of a small personal coffee maker), this produces great results. I am very pleased.\n\nThe next question I like to satisfy is whether I would purchase this item. Yes, absolutely. This is far better than a simple grinder, though a bit more expensive of course. But really given the options out there for drinking great coffee (machines, this grinder, beans available) given the money laid out to the coffee stops, this isn't that much. Enjoy.\n\nUpdate 3/2019: Well I have been using this for more than 7 months now. Here are some thoughts. One is the Oxo logo on the power button has worn right off from use. Also, I started to notice that the machine would quit working. So definitely there needs to be a cleaning that takes place. In fact, the machine stopped working totally. After removing the upper burr ring and putting this upside down, this worked for a bit and stopped again. I looked and took this apart and I concluded this was kaput. However, after reading some further reviews, it appeared that the machine probably had some beans sticking and causing the burrs unable to move. Sure enough, I took a Q tip and cleaned out the lower burr inside and out popped some pieces of beans. i then put this upside down and hit the bottom and more pieces of beans popped out. After that, I replaced the pieces and voila! the thing operated better than it had in months probably. So the conclusion is ion the machine does that start and stop and whatever, it isn't broken or done, it just needs to be cleaned (and frankly after understanding this, I can't imagine any similar design wouldn't have this same issue). So now, I understand the machine a bit better and this should be good to go. I suspect OXO should put out better instructions in this regard and warn users that this is possible and very fixable."

Originally, we had a manual one-while it worked it wasn't convenient and it was hard to clean. Our next version was just a cheap electric one-also hard to clean and ground the beans very inconsistently. So for awhile we stuck to ground coffee and pods. Pods while convenient can get expensive, and the machine we had you could only get your pods online or about an hour away from our home-scratch that, not very convenient.\n\nBut this grinder? AMAZING! you can set a timer-up to 30 seconds. We've found that gives us exactly what we need for a full pot on our coffee brewer. You can set how course your want it-we like it a bit courser. And it comes with a convenient little cup to catch it all. The larger size actually makes it easier to clean for me. This grinder is a bit pricey, but I'm finding the ease of use and convenience make the price justifiable."

Grinding time determines the amount of grounds desired, and one can leave it on a preferred setting.\n\nThe hopper lid is dark, transparent but dark. It's dark because it blocks UV rays, thereby preserving the freshness of the beans.

            "answer": "Not sure about actual RPM measurement, but not particularly fast and fewer RPMs than my italian burr grinder. This OXO grinder is pretty spectacular!

            "answer": "I'm sorry, but cannot say for sure. It would depend upon the size of the portafilter. and how well it fits over the discharge opening. My guess is that you would make a mess because the finely ground coffee would be blown outside of the portafilter."
