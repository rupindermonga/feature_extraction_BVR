            "reviewText": "Grinds consistently and finely. It's easy to operate and fast. Two issues prevent it from being excellent. First, there are always coffee grinders that fall out of the machine after grinding and removing the glass cup. And static electricity builds up in the cup, which keeps some of the grounds on the side when you empty the cup. The only way I've found to fix the static electricity issue is to wait at least 10 minutes after grinding to remove the cup. Second, the instructions are very minimal and not helpful. After 7 months, my grinder stopped grinding. It would make a whirring sound but wouldn't grind. I looked in the instructions to find a fix and there was no trouble-shooting information. I was about to send it back to Bodum when I went on line and found a video that showed how to disassemble the machine and clean the clog. It turns out that grinding french roast, which is very oily, on a fine setting clogs the machine over time and you have to take it apart and clean the burr and the chute. I saw a great video online that recommended running 1/4 cup of rice through the machine regularly to clean it out. I cleaned out the chute with a thin bottle brush, tapped it gently against the sink to remove the remaining grinds, then ran rice through it. It works fine again."

But finally the plastic retainer ring that holds the upper burr broke. It was not available for replacement on the Bodum site. I contacted Bodum customer service (not an easy process, no customer service phone number available, email only). I was told that I would have to check their website replacement parts page to see when the part would be available ( no option to backorder or be notified when the part would become available). Was also told that the inexpensive plastic retainer ring was not sold as a seperate part, but could only be purchased with the upper burr. I couldn't believe that one of the most likely to break inexpensive plastic pieces on a product that cost $100 was both unavailable and must be purchased as part of a more expensive piece. Needless to say I was disappointed and will not purchase any more products from this company. For those of you experiencing this same problem, I ended up repairing the part myself using J-B plastic bond and trimming excess bonding material to size with a sharp knife and sandpaper. Note: added extra bonding material to junction of the break at the end of both long edges where the tolerances are not as critical as the inner and outer edges."

Then I read the instructions--my paraphrase: \"After 20 seconds of grinding (the maximum period) allow it to stand for 5 minutes so that the grinding motor will not overheat. Then you may grind again--up to a maximum of 20 seconds, etc.\"\n\nI set the machine to \"fine\" and selected \"20 seconds.\" It ground 6 grams. I didn't believe it!\n\nI waited 5 minutes and did another 20 second grind. It produced 7 grams!\n\nI want a grinder which produces at least 60 grams for a breakfast brew,\n\nTHIS MACHINE IS A TOY FOR DOLL COFFEE PARTIES, NOT A COFFEE GRINDER FOR HUMANS.\n\nI'm returning it today.\n\nMike"

Two days after I initiated the return I found a collar piece that sits between the hopper and the Burr. It just sits there mind you. It must have fallen off when I unpacked it from the box. Now, when it wouldn't grind correctly I must have read the instructions a dozen times to see if I missed something. The company must consider this small collar, that just sits on there, part of the grinder because it was not listed anywhere. Basically it was just \"put the hopper on, add beans, and go.\" If it had been listed as a part, or at least a footnote to make sure it was sitting there, I could have saved myself a headache. That's why I knocked off a star on this updated review. All that being said, now that I have it assembled correctly it works like a charm. I ground everything from powder fine to chunky percolator grounds just to be sure. The catch basket could seal a little better in my opinion, but if it wasn't for the lack of instruction/confusion I would have went five stars. Now I have to go cancel the return..."

            "reviewDate": "April 24, 2017",
            "reviewText": "Update 12/10/2017\n\nI downgraded this rating to 3 stars; after 8.5 months it now grinds about 50% of what it used to in a single 20-second run, requiring us to run it twice. I have cleaned the burrs in the unit so that is not the problem. Thinking of opening it up to see if the pathway below the lower burr is clogged. Both burrs should be easily removable for cleaning and inspection. >_>\n\nAnother update, same day:\n\nI removed the bottom, slid the motor/drivetrain assembly down. The drive was full of coffee grounds and everything else inside was coated with grounds. The hopper itself was not clogged at all. I used a canned duster to blow off most of the grounds, not bothering to fully disassemble. The grinder now produces about 90% of the coffee grounds it used to on a single run. I suspect if I put the time into tearing it down completely I'll find a whole lot of grinds in between the gear faces and if I rebuild it, it would be back to 100%.\n\nWhat does this tell us? They need to work on sealing the mechanism better to prevent dust/grounds ingress into the drivetrain. Bumped my rating back up to three but I am still disappointed at what I saw when I opened it up. Shame on Bodum!\n\n---\nOriginal 4-star review:\n\nI used to grind my coffee at the supermarket using the large burr grinders, or at home with a blade grinder, and never noticed much difference between the two. Since I relocated and the local supermarkets here don't clean their grinders (ever) I haven't bothered in a while but I missed my espresso so I bought one of these burr grinders.\n\nNow that I grind the beans within a couple of minutes of making espresso I now notice the difference in depth of flavor and strength of the espresso, and I find that this little grinder actually makes a more consistent grind than the large units at the supermarket, and grinding within minutes of brewing does actually make a difference.\n\nWhat I like about the Bodum Bistro Electric Burr Coffee Grinder:\n\n* It produces a consistent grind\n* It is easy to clean\n* It offers a good capacity for espresso lovers\n* It grinds quickly\n\nWhat could be improved:\n\n* The coffee grinds cling to the side of the cup due to static. This could be alleviated if there were a metallic film on the glass or if they were to laminate a screen into the glass to dissipate the static charge, albeit adding a significant cost to manufacture\n* The unit could benefit from a contact switch or other method of sensing whether the cup is in the unit (I've hit the button, forgetting to put the cup in place to catch the grind)\n* the grind selector can be adjusted only while the unit is operating, and is integrated into the hopper. I would like to see the adjustor made discrete and adjustable before beginning a grind\n* the cup could benefit from being shaped with a spout or a simple angle to make pouring into an espresso filter possible\n* reading others' complaints about lack of replacement parts, I am disappointed that Bodum do not make parts available for servicing the unit. While the unit functions fine so far I am disappointed in that\n\nBottom line: although a burr grinder is an unexciting purchase I am very pleased with the unit and am enjoying the results much better than previous (blade) grinders I have owned. Also, regarding the burr vs. blade grinder debate I am now a believer. :)\n\nUpdate 16 months later: I need to run it about 5 times in a row to grind enough. I've torn it down a couple of times for a thorough cleaning and reassembled it and it restores the functionality by about 80% but I can't be bothered to do it again. I'll be looking at other options. Give this unit a miss! Downgrading to 2 stars."

            "reviewText": "I'm a Bodum fan, with lots of their glassware. I like their design aesthetic, and they certainly applied it to the Bistro Electric Burr Coffee Grinder. I bought it eight months ago, and at first I was happy with the purchase. I now regret buying it. I'll tell you why after I tell you why I started out so positive:\n\nWhat I like:\n1) Great design, as mentioned.\n2) Glass grounds container works great.\n3) Not too noisy. (Though not super quiet, either.)\n4) Metal burr assembly.\n\nHere are the problems:\n1) 20 second on, five minute off duty cycle. I have a Bonavita coffee maker (love it) and there is no way 20 seconds grinds enough coffee. Do I wait for five minutes (painful) or risk damaging the Bodum (painful). I don't need a painful choice in the morning!\n2) Ground coffee builds up under the burr sleeve (what I'm calling the stationary metal grinding surface that surrounds the rotating burr) which causes the grind to get finer and finer.\n3) The gear train that connects the electric motor to the nice metal burr is plastic!\n\nSo here is what happens. Over days and weeks, throughput goes down. Rather than 40 seconds of grinding, I need 60 (that would be 11 minutes ... too long, so I only give it two or three minutes between grinds.) Then I figure out that I need to really clean it, taking it apart as much as I can without tools. Now it gets better, but not to original performance. Then a few odd sounds and now the motor is running but the burr isn't turning.\n\nThis is a product that should just work. Hey, Bodum, how about a version with beefy enough components that it can run for five minutes straight? Or just one minute straight? I'd pay more for that. I'd say it worked the way I want for about 20% of my ownership of it.\n\nUntil the product is more robust, with more consistent performance, it isn't worth buying in my opinion.\n\nUPDATE: I connected with Bodum, which took some persistence, but ultimately they stood behind their product and I have a new one. I took the old one apart and will upload a picture explaining what went wrong. Taking it apart told me a lot; they didn't cut corners on the inside, but did make a fairly rookie engineering mistake, with a weak point in the gear train that was pretty obvious. Still, I was impressed with what I saw inside. Fix the mistake, put a bigger winding on the motor so it doesn't overheat, charge another $20, and they have a winner!\n\nUPDATE 2: i did upload pictures, and they were up for a while, but I notice they are gone now. Oh well. I found a flaw in the plastic geartrain.\n\nUPDATE 3: I like Peet's coffee (mocha java) and figured out it is a big part of the problem. It is just too oily for this grinder. The throughput is slow and it builds up. When I use a medium roast (Blue Bottle) it works much better."

I bought this electric grinder to save myself a little time and effort and the reviews suggested good value for money with good grind quality as well.\n\nThis is a good coffee grinder in terms of grind quality (I use a medium coarse grind for the french press), speed, and noise. I haven't had it long enough to comment on durability, but I would expect it to last at least a couple years without issues.\n\nHowever, as other reviewers have noted, the collection box is poorly designed and causes a mess, and worse, wasted grounds. The box doesn't fit flush to the machine, leaving a small gap on the top through which the grounds fly out from. A simple overhang on the box would have solved this issue, and I've taped a piece of cardboard to the box top, which seems to help. Once you do get the box in, it wedges in quite tightly, making the removal process cumbersome. You always run the risk of pulling out too hard and sending grounds all over the place.\nThe instruction manual is poorly done and needs an update. It needs to include the plastic piece that goes on top of the grinder; it is not mentioned on it at all. Also, you need to have the grinder completely assembled before changing the grind setting, which is also not mentioned. Spent some time thinking I might have a defective piece.\nThese are issues with simple fixes that should be addressed; it would make it worth the price paid at that point. Right now, I regret not having bought a good old manual grinder. It DID have a nice romance to it."

Since I am unable to return this item for a refund, I'm posting a 1 star review. The container that holds the grinds has a small opening that makes it difficult to dispense the grounds. The reviews indicate that this grinder is quiet, but it is quite loud actually. And the top lid for the device doesn't attach easily, making it an issue each morning to get it to snap on. Overall, terrible product, especially compared to the better products I have used and enjoyed from Bodum."

            "reviewText": "The grinder that I received was either defective or this line of grinders is poorly designed. Though not a deal breaker, the seal on the hopper lid was chewed up at both the 9 o'clock and 3 o'clock positions. A poor seal on the hopper means you can't store beans in the hopper without them getting stale and/or losing flavor\n\nThe deal breaker that made me return this was that it would only produce 1 teaspoon of ground coffee when setting the coarseness level to \"espresso\" and the timer to the maximum of 20 seconds. The instruction manual says that you need to wait 5 minutes in between each 20 second run cycle to let the motor cool down. So in order to grind enough coffee for a single shot of espresso took 10 minutes. I can get over a tablespoon of espresso with a tiny hand grinder in about 3 minutes.\n\nI had very good luck with the Bodum Antigua that i bought over 15 years ago. It was truly amazing in the amount of coffee it could grind in a short period of time and the wide variety of coarseness settings. Eventually the cup that catches the grinds wouldn't stay in place any more and I had to strap it in with a large rubber band or strip of double-sided Velcro."

The grind adjustment is the hopper itself and is variable from super coarse to powder, I use a stovetop espresso maker so I like a pretty fine grind. The grounds container is borosilicate glass and does not exhibit the static (grounds sticking to the container) like plastic ones do. The grounds stick mildly but with gentle tapping on the container, you will win the battle of grounds expulsion (as long as the open end is facing down). Now, the really cool part. As can be seen in the main image, the power switch is in the lower left side, just aft of the grounds catcher. On the top of the unit, just in front of the hopper is the timer and the on/off switch. The timer can be set from one second to twenty second or anywhere in between. Set the timer, there are markings for 5, 10 and 20 seconds, turn on the power and push the on/off switch. If for any reason, you need to terminate the grinding before the machine has completed the timed grind, just push the on/off switch again. At first, I didn't think I was going to like this feature, but it is actually what makes this grinder even cooler than it looks. My only complaint about the timer is that it has no resistance (of course, resistance is futile) and it is quite easy to change the timed grind when moving the machine if you put a finger or a thumb on the timer as the machine is being moved. Just have to check it every time you use it especially if there is more than one person in the household. Some reviewers talk about noise, I suppose if you don't want to wake someone sleeping nearby, wait until you can see the whites of their eyes and then, Punch it! It is packaged well so it should arrive unscathed from its travels. If you purchase one of these, Enjoy!"

I decided to try to turn it on and try a 5 second spin to perhaps get things aligned or something, but it will not even work? The red power button lights up, however pressing the smaller top grind button does nothing and will not grind now? This is ridiculous for the amount of money it cost and such hassle involved. Just contacted Bodum, we shall see if they even do anything about it, I read the last page in their manual in fine print and it is saying something about a \"guarantee certificate\" needing to be completed at time of purchase and how it is required for any guarantee service......you know, duh, who doesn't sit down with the fake little diplomas that come with products and fill out and drive to the post office to buy a stamp and mail out the day you open it. That is something every responsible consumer does and shame on you if you don't.

The stainless steel conical burrs are wonderful and they grind beans with ease. The different settings for grind consistently/level and time to grind, are great. The grinder features an on/off switch and a \"press to grind\" button for grinding.\n\nBodum advertises this: \"Borosilicate glass catcher reduces static that causes jumping coffee grounds\" and this couldn't be more untrue. This is my biggest gripe with this product. The glass catcher is not static proof, it's quite the opposite. Once you grind your beans into the catcher, you will notice that there is A LOT of leftover grinds, that no matter how hard you hit the bottom of the catcher, will not leave the catcher. Over time, this just builds up until you're forced to manually stick a paper towel or your hand into the glass catcher to physically remove the leftover grinds. The grinds also stick to the bottom of the glass catcher \"cap.\"\n\nThe machine makes a lot of noise when grinding, so much so, that you have to step away from it. It's not made from expensive materials so it feels kind of cheap.\n\nThis is definitely an \"entry-level\" grinder, meaning if you're not going to be using it extensively, it's worth the investment. But if you're going to be using it a lot, the grinds getting stuck to the glass catcher will get annoying real quick."

In fact I was pleased enough that I bought one as a gift for a friend that only grinds coffee occasionally. For my own use I replaced the Bodum with a more durable Capresso grinder. Recently (2016) I bought another Bodum for the purpose of grinding coffee in my office, because my coffee addiction is totally under control and I figured the light duty, good looking Bodum would fit well in my office. Unfortunately this unit seemed very flimsy, more so than I remembered from my original one, bought sometime in 2012 -2013. Frustratingly, it would not grind on any setting below the middle mark. Setting it any finer would result in the sound of plastic gears skipping and no coffee being ground. I took it apart to investigate and it seems that a mechanism designed to protect the gears was allowing this skipping. I tried a few different types of beans wondering if what I was using was somehow too hard, but the problem persisted. I kept on using it for a few months but finally got tired of drinking coffee that was ground too coarsely. The whole idea of having a setup in my office was to avoid terrible coffee in the first place and the grind I was getting from the Bodum was ruining my otherwise decent quality setup. So I gave it away on the company bulletin board and bought a Baratza Encore like I should have done in the first place."

The additional flavor I'm getting out of the same beans is amazing. If you love coffee, I am telling you to get one of these! It's a joy to start each morning with a cup of Joe made from freshly ground coffee.\n\nAfter comparing many products in this price point I chose this product because of the reviews, and I just thought it looked awfully cool. I would have loved it in chrome, but couldn't see spending twice as much especially when I had just enough Amazon points to buy the black one.\n\nThe lid has a guide for how long to grind your coffee to get the right amount, but you might have to experiment. I typically use a dark roast, like Sumatra from Costco, and I like my coffee strong. Still, I had to reduce the recommended time by half.\n\nThe glass collector does a great job of keeping coffee from sticking and flying, but I decided to take a short cut. My small coffee filter holder fits in the slot, so I just grind the coffee directly into the filter. BTW, I am still using this fabulous coffee maker that I bought in 2009. It's great if you don't make a large volume of coffee and like your coffee to be brewed at the the right temp.\u00a0Zojirushi EC-DAC50 Zutto 5-Cup Drip Coffeemaker\n\nI was concerned about the reviews concerning pebbles and gear failure. I don't know if the company has made improvements, but they claim to have a safety mechanism to shut off the machine in this case to prevent damage. Even though it seems to be a common problem, I've never found a pebble in my coffee and I've been using beans for many years.\n\nI am attaching a little video of my very first experience grinding with this lovely little machine. Hope you find my review helpful!\n\nUPDATED 15 Nov 2017: Today it happened for the first time in my coffee grinding life. There was a pebble in the beans. My grinder came to a premature stop with an agonizing groan. It took an ice pick to get that sucker out, but I won the battle. The best part is that after I did a thorough cleaning, put the grinder back together, and plugged it in, it worked just fine. I tried a different coffee from the big box store. I am going back to my Sumatra."

It's nice when it's new. I could find no tricks with common household products to remedy this and every particle of dust in your home will stick to it like a magnet. Mine was black so it looked like hell. The whole thing felt like handling a piece of double-sided scotch tape. I cleaned the exterior with a damp microfiber cloth reserved for kitchen appliances and never with any chemicals so this is a quality issue.\n\nI'm done with this brand. They make a good french press but that's about it. My Bodum mini electric kettle burnt up after a few dozen uses due to a faulty two-stage safety switch that failed to engage. It nuked itself. I later found out this is common. Bodum customer service never responded to my email. I ended up selling the grinder to recover a few bucks and ditched the smelly plastic kettle.\n\nI didn't keep the unit long enough to experience the stripped gear issue. I'm so very sorry for the customers that had this problem and who wasted their money. Had I known of this earlier I would have thrown it away instead of passing the problem onto someone else.\n\nNo pride goes into these products, just fancy design and finicky moving parts. Buy something else like an entry-level Baratza. Uglier but built well with replaceable parts and from what I've heard, genius customer service. That's where I'm heading next. You should come to."

The center if the bottom of the receptacle simply crumbled like a cheap piece of candy into my hand, leaving a dime sized circular hole. I was uninjured luckily, but the glass container was useless at that point.\nThere is a customer service phone number included with the instruction booklet, which I called. I could not tell if it was for Bodum, because it goes to a recorded message that offers no option to speak to anyone from Bodum, and honestly sounds like a scam number. The recording does not identify that you have reached Bodum, it may have been abandoned by the company and picked up by scammers afterward. Their current customer service is evidently by email only, which I used. It took them a full week to get back to me, and the response was to suggest that I purchase a replacement at a web link.\nThe grinder was less than a week in my home, so basically it took less time to break than to get a response from customer service.

First impressions: Ridiculously easy to use and clean, grinds perfectly, looks nice, no static electricity issue, no mess. Even better I got it as an Amazon Warehouse Deal for $20 less than if I bought it \"new\" from Amazon.\n\nUpdate: I originally gave this 5 stars, but am now downgrading my rating. After a month, the glass container fractured at the bottom. I did not drop it. Just happened from normal use. I read some other complaints about this happening and so it seemed the glass was either too thin at the base or too brittle. Unfortunately, the warranty does not cover glass breakage. Bodum, however, does sell replacements which, with tax and shipping, runs over $16. This did not seem right to me where I did nothing and the glass broke on it's own. I contacted Bodum, but they ignored my claim that there was a product defect and dismissed my request for a free replacement as not covered by the warranty. So much for valuing happy customers! I decided against buying a new container as there was no reason to believe another would not also fail.Luckily, however, one of the Amazon purchasers who had this problem had another better solution - a Tablecraft (H159) 10 oz Stainless Steel Dredge - sold here on Amazon for $5. Just remove the cover of the Dredge and substitute the cover from the Bodum container. Everything fits perfectly and there is no static electricity. The stainless steel must discharge the static electricity. It's such an easy durable fix that I wonder why all grinders aren't made like this to begin with."

I did a lot of research on grinders and review-reading before choosing this one, but it was our first higher-end burr grinder so in all fairness I can't compare it to others. Part of why I chose this one is because our french press is also Bodum.\n\nStatic is a significant issue in the cup after grinding, which makes removal of the cup and removal of the ground coffee a bit messy. We bought a small cosmetic (blush) brush that we use only for the purpose of brushing our grounds out of the cup. Just a drop of water on the brush makes coffee ground removal fairly clean and easy.\n\nThe only performance issue after daily use is that while using it on largest grind/french press setting (for us that is always), the bean vessel begins to vibrate and rotate clockwise which stops the grinding (it's also how you remove the vessel). That is, the motor/timer is still running, but the beans are no longer grinding and you lose track of how much you have/need. So, we have to place our hand on top of it now to hold it steady to keep it from turning past french press on the furthest end of the grind range.\n\nMy only other complaint would stand for any other grinders that I am aware of, at that is regarding the clear bean vessel; I wonder why they don't make the vessel at least a smoke brown or grey color so the beans are not subjected to quite as much light.\n\nI have recommended this grinder before because I suppose it has done alright with daily use.

Burr grinders are DEFINITELY the way to go if you are serious/picky about your coffee. And they are a necessity if you want to make a really good espresso.\n\nThe Bodum is kind of quirky in that you are only supposed to grind 20 seconds & then let it cool down for 5 minutes. That was actually kind of a pain since I usually grind a bigger batch than that - daily. It also made a mess on my counter top every morning; grinds get caught inside the machine & come out the bottom & I mean out of the bottom of the housing in ADDITION to needing a whack to get the grounds out of the chute. The \"chute whack\" was not a big deal to me but the grounds coming out of the housing? What a mess & there was no end to them.\n\nWhen this machine started dying, I took it completely apart by unscrewing the housing, etc. The inside around the motor & everywhere was FULL of grounds. That may be part of the reason it's dying. I was always diligent about maintenance/cleaning the machine, burrs, etc. every 1-2 weeks so it's not like I did not take good care of it. You shouldn't have to take the whole machine apart to clean but if you own this machine, you really should. Mine probably would have lasted longer had I known this.\n\nIt was a very noisy machine but I've heard worse. Static could be a slight problem but really all you need to do is wait a couple minutes for the static to dissipate before you pour out your grounds; I do that with any grinder. The glass jar was a nice feature for cleaning, etc.\n\nI think there are better, more durable burr grinders around this price range. When I bought it, it was $76 (black version) which I think is a fair price for the quality."

While I had the Capresso I did note that it had a mechanical timer that would need to be re-set every morning. The Bodum uses a separate dial to set time and a push button to engage. No mechanical timer to wear out or slow down prematurely and no fiddling with time settings in the morning.\n\nSo instead of ordering another black Bodum, which looks great when new but has a coating that soon deteriorates into grossness, I ordered the metal (cast aluminum) chrome version, which is actually silver in color. The heavier metal body does seem to run quieter than the black plastic Bodum, and about the same as the plastic Capresso Infinity that I briefly used. Reduced burr spin speed plus the plastic gearing used in the Bodum, and I assume in all burr grinders in this price range, probably also help reduce noise levels.\n\nOne of the nice things about Bodum burr grinders is the glass grounds container which looks good and is useful to catch any falling grounds when the grinder is not being operated. When grinding coffee beans, with the glass container removed, one can just hold a paper coffee filter under the chute and press the button. I do a medium grind setting into a #4 cone filter and a 16 second grind time.\n\nSo while not perfect I don't think there are a lot of choices better."

To compensate for this, I use the coarsest setting (with the French press symbol) for French roast beans, and the fourth most coarse setting for lightly roasted beans, Medium and full city roasts will do best with settings in between. Also, follow the brewing instructions on Bodum's website: 7 grams of coffee to every 4 oz. water. Steep for 4 minutes before pressing. Stirring is unnecessary. I recommend an electric kettle that brings the water to 200 degrees F. The right grind is critical for brewing outstanding French press coffee, and this machine delivers it. There are several conical grinders on the market that do not grind coarse enough for French press (and a few are quite expensive).\n\nI've had less success in grinding for certain drip methods with this machine, and would not recommend this mill at all for espresso brewing (it does work well for moka pot/stovetop espresso, though).\n\nOne other thing I really appreciate about the Bistro is the relative lack of static and flying grounds.\n\nWorth the money if you like French press coffee."

We both work at a big chain coffee shop and have the option of grinding our coffee there but the course of the grind is always wrong and inconsistant, you can't choose to grind different course options per brewing method as you have to pick just one grind option per bag, you get other coffees mixing in, it was just no good. With this thing, you can have a French press in the morning and espresso at night, each optimally ground per the method chosen. The grind is always consistent. Its grinding coffee so it's not quiet but it never wakes me up in the early mornings. Its never so loud that it's unbearable while standing next to it. The machine itself if quiet. Testing it without beans proves that. It has a large hopper which can hold about a half a pound of beans. Its a real winner and my husband uses it almost always 2, sometimes 3 times a day. It takes up about the same space as two average coffee mugs next to each other. Its got a special place in our coffee toolbox for sure. I will update if anything changes."

However, I had to give this one a try since the reviews were so great, not only on Amazon, but on other coffee guru websites. This is perfect for my pour over and french press coffee mastering journey. I would recommend this for sure.\n\nUpdated 12/13/18: This grinder is still going strong and I still love it. I've read a few reviews about how purchasers don't like it because of the glass catcher or it's hard to clean. While the glass catcher has less static, I've solved any static issue by using a stainless steel dredge as my catcher. It's the perfect size for this grinder and I have zero static. As far as cleaning it, I don't find it hard at all. I've seen the rice trick, but used it only twice. The rice is still messy and you have to clean it afterward anyway. What I do is take off the hopper, use a stiff brush to clean what I can, then I use a compressed air canister to blow out any remaining grinds inside the unit. Put the hopper back on and I'm ready to go. I use this at least once a day and have had it over a year now."

I have just now noticed an electrical smell when I run the grinder more than 20 seconds. This caveat is also mentioned in the instructions. Beware of grinding too fine using the finest setting to the far right as used for French Press. There is a tendency for the vibration to turn off the grinder safety disconnect as the hopper lever is trying to disassemble itself as is required for periodic cleaning. I have noticed as well not to use oily or dark roast beans as they tend to clog the burrs and make the grounds stick to the sides of the boro-silicate glass catch bowl.I would definitely recommend this grinder especially for French Roast users. I clean my hopper and burrs every month and wash the stainless burrs in hot soapy water then dry thoroughly."

Push the grind button and nothing happens. It's most likely an electrical fault (switch, motor?), otherwise I'd at least be treated to some horrific grinding noises. Their \"limited\" warranty is for 1 year. Maybe they know something about their product that they're not sharing? At the price you'd expect better quality, or at least a longer warranty.Or maybe they're just coasting on their good reviews.\n\nUsage: Pretty much every day, for breakfast. Very occasionally a couple of additional times when guests were around. The current was on all the timer, mostly. (I do not recall any warnings to always switch it off; but it's hard to remember to do this, especially before you've actually had a chance to drink any of the coffee.) So let's say 500-600 grinds in total. The Bodum replaced a Braun that kept going for ~10 years before its (screeching) death. I had wanted to replace it; unfortunately Braun had stopped selling them, at least in this market. Is this what they mean by creative destruction?\n\nNow what? I guess it's ground coffee from the shop, until I figure this out.\n\nI ended up buying this one:\u00a0Ariete -Delonghi Electric Coffee Grinder - Professional Heavy Duty Stainless Steel, Conical Burr - Ultra Fine Grind, Adjustable Cup Size, 15 Fine - Coarse Grind Size Settings\nIt's better designed, much quieter. The only thing I miss (maybe) is the continuous grind time adjustment; but then I figured out that adjustig the amount of water you use makes up for it.

The grinding creates a static electric charge and the ground coffee tends to fly around when you open the lid to dump out the ground coffee. this happens for all grinders, but it's worse for this model than for other grinders I've used. Also, you can only grind enough for 1-2 cups at a time, as the grinder overheats and gives off a burnt smell if you try to grind more. This last point is the main drawback in my opinion. I'd like to grind enough for an entire pot of coffee, and I don't have half an hour to spend doing that."

In the year that I have had this grinder, I have grinded the equivalent of about 25 - 30 12 oz bags of coffee. The machine fires up immediately and has no problem switching between espresso, pour over, and French press grind settings which I have provided a picture of.\n\nA couple of underrated features of this Burr grinder are the lid and the cord. Weird right? The lid has a handy guide which tells you just how long to set the grind timer for each grind setting depending on the volume or weight of the beans placed in the machine. This has really helped me get a read on the amount of beans I need to place in the hopper for a single cup of coffee. Of course it is no subsitution for weighing the beans yourself. The cord is a great feature because you are able to wrap up all of the extra cord that you don't need and it sits nice and flat on the bottom of the machine. It really helps add to the aesthetics of the grinder.\n\nOne thing that has amazed with this machine is how durable it is. When my girlfriend took the liberty of helping me clean the machine, she ran water through the hopper and through the grinding mechanism which of course normally spells doom for an electric grinder because of the components. I thought I was out of a grinder whenever she did that because it wouldn't grind for the next couple of hours. After it had set out for a while and dried off, I was able to immediately fire it up again and it worked as if nothing happened.\n\nMy only grievance with the machine is that it is extremely hard to keep the important parts clean. My best option for cleaning out the grinding pieces themselves was to take a toothpick and pick out built up residue and then use a damp cotton swab to \"wash off\" what was left.\n\nI would definitely purchase this machine again!"

Since I'm not into spending 200 dollars on a coffee grinder I've had to be more resourceful in finding a good grinder for my espressos. I've invested in a manual grinder that was ceramic for around 15 dollars and it worked great for about 5 months until it broke. It also took about 5 or more minutes to grind for 1 shot. Well after that grinder broke I decided to invest a little more into this electric grinder. I was skeptical because it was not ceramic and it was priced cheaper than the \"better\" ones.\nWhen I received the grinder I was a little taken back because of the plastic timer knob on the grinder. It kind of gives it a cheap look and feel so I was worried that the rest of the grinder followed suit. But after using it I found that it didn't really matter because I grind my coffee for the same amout of time each time so I don't do any adjusting anyway. Although I did try at 10 seconds initially then found 15 seconds suited me better. The rest of the grinder, though, is not cheap and it works great. The grinds I get out of this grinder seem to match what I got out of the manual ceramic grinder, except alot quicker. My espressos look and taste fantastic and I feel smarter for spending so much less for this than one of those 200 dollar grinders."

No instructions on assembling, although once you figure it out it is not hard. Odd, because it comes with a booklet with names of parts and 2 1/2 pages of instructions and then about 70 pages of that info in various llanguages. Rather than selecting how many cups of coffee you are grinding for you have to figure out how much will be ground in 5,10,15, or 20 seconds. Which means if I wanted to make 12 cups, I would have to grind for the max of 20 seconds, and WAIT 5 MINUTES to grind another 20 seconds (according to the instructions).\nYes it is quieter than the Cuisinart, but it's messier and twice the price.

The unit is both good looking and has a nice \"feel\" - solid and well designed, with close tolerances between device sections, and nice textures. The exterior (I ordered the black color) has a matte finish with a smooth, slightly rubberized feel that is very nice. The glass container that catches the ground coffee (yay, glass, static control!) fits snugly in the unit, and the thick rubber collar around it makes it easy to keep a grip on it. A great combination of design and materials. 1 star.\n\nInstructions: The manual looks impressively thick. Then you open it and realize that there are a whole bunch of languages and about three pages for each language. :) That said, the info they provide is sufficient.to understand and use the grinder. 2 stars.\n\nUse: The device setup and use is easy. Add beans to the hopper, turn it on, set the timer, set the grind (from comments here, set to finest grind and then back off to desired setting for best results), and hit the start button. If the beans run out before the timer runs out, stop the unit by hitting the start button again. Slide the glass grind container from the unit and either remove top and spoon out perfectly consistent ground coffee, or pour into my ground coffee container. The fact that you are supposed to only do one 20s run of the grinder w/a five minute wait is a non-issue, as I can grind more than enough coffee for my needs in one 20s run. I have zero issues w/static, a common issue w/some grinders. 3 stars.\n\nNoise: Grinding makes noise, of course, but the noise from this unit is contained and not annoying. A non-issue, which is very nice. 4 stars.\n\nGrind results: I've only ground espresso so far, and on the second-lowest setting it creates a very fine grind better than I have found from any in-store grinder. Still need to experiment with a range of coarse to fine settings, and find my favorite espresso setting, but clearly this thing provides a very consistent grind. 5 stars.\n\nDurability/reliability/consistency over time: Unknown (at least for my use/my unit) at this time. No rating.\n\nAt this price point I'm very impressed with this unit.\n\nWill initial love fade over time, or can my Bodum and I find happiness that lasts into our golden years? Only time will tell."

As other reviewers point out, it does create a great consistent grind, which improves coffee taste. Unfortunately Bodum made a few design flaws: while the grinding apparatus is all steel, plastic is used to lock the grinding gears together. The outer part of the mill is allowed to wobble against the spiral screw that draws in coffee beans.\n\nThis becomes a problem as the wobble, or movement, became to increase over the week. initially i didn't notice the wobble, but just as it stopped grinding i noticed there was quite a bit of play. What happens now is the grinder routinely gets jammed by a bean and the grinding apparatus is out of place due to the wobble.\n\nI think the plastic simply wears away. This was a bit heart breaking since I put up a logical argument, to my wife, for upgrading from our regular blade coffee grinder. I was very hopeful since I love the Bodum aesthetic. For now it's back to my blade grinder, but I do want a burr coffee grinder. It dramatically changes the taste.\n\nAnyone know of a decent solidly constructed burr coffee grinder?"

For example, to make a full pot for me (40 ounces of water) I use 60 grams of beans and set the grinder to one notch coarser than the drip coffee setting. It takes two 15 second grinds with this machine to get it done. I wait a minute or two between grinds but some days I'm in a rush and grind it back to back. People with 12 cup machines might need to grind even up to 3 times for one pot. That seems a bit ridiculous. I usually give the machine a good tap to make sure all the ground coffee drops into the glass collection jar.\n\nThe quality of the machine seems high with nice materials that work well together. I wish the hopper lid had a bit more of an edge to it but it is heavy enough to set on top without a full seal and it will keep your jumping beans in no problem. The glass collection jar is nice as it knocks down the static charge BUT YOU CAN ADD ONE MORE STEP TO MAKE IT VIRTUALLY DISAPPEAR. Simply drop 2 - 3 drops of water in the hopper before you start and it will keep the burrs clean and cut the static down to basically zero."

The Bodum while not perfect, is near perfect on containing the grounds. We live in a very dry climate, this static \"feature\" may not be an issue in a more humid setting\n\nThe Bodum's grind is good for both espresso and drip; and all features work well.\n\nBodum's instructions to wait 5 minutes before grinding again after a 20 second grind seems arbitrary. Since we use the grinder with a Capresso Ultima to make single serving crema we simply get several cups ground at once rather than one grind per cup.\n\nWhile the Bodum controls work well, I liked the Capresso Infinity controls better.\n\nOn both brands you turn the bean receptacle to select the grind.\n\nCapresso...Turn one dial to the grind duration and release.\nBodum...Turn master switch on; select the grind duration with a rotating dial; press the grind start button once; when grind completes, turn master switch off.\n\nDespite the extra controls I like the Bodum. Time will tell on the longevity...so far so good\n\n---UPDATE--- 3 years later. It no longer can grind using any of the espresso settings to the left of medium. After the max grind cycle hardly any ground coffee is produced. A full cycle above the middle setting barely gets 2 TBL spoons, the amount for one cup in my Capresso. I've taken apart and cleaned and all looks OK but the quantity produced is terrible. On the plus side the glass container does a great job in capturing most of the grind and does not have the static problems of other grinders."

            "reviewText": "First of all, this coffee grinder does produce wonderful-tasting ground coffee. According to everything I've read, it takes a burr grinder to make really good coffee, especially espresso. It's important to use this type of grinder for espresso, as regular grinders grind unevenly and can produce some particles so small they clog up expensive espresso machines. This Bodum machine grinds evenly, but the drawback is that it takes FOREVER! You can't just dump in your coffee beans and expect it to work, because it will immediately clog up and stop. Instead, I get the thing running, usually setting it at 10-seconds, gradually adding a few beans at a time while it is running. That means it takes awhile to grind enough coffee for an electric drip machine. On the other hand, it only takes a few seconds for an espresso machine. And it is NOISY! This grinder should be cleaned--with the little brush that is supplied--after every use, but that is a quick, easy little chore. Final summary: slow, noisy, inconvenient, but makes terrific coffee. Well worth the extra time and effort. Just don't fill it with coffee beans the first time you use it (like I did), or it won't work and you will have to dump the beans out."

I cleaned it to a T, so I know it wasn't clogged. It was annoying in the 1st place that it ground so little. Only enough for 1 1/2 espresso shots at a time. Then you have wait 5 minutes to grind more. It worked fine for coarse settings like french press. But with 2 people who like double espressos for breakfast every morning, it was a 20 minute process. I cleaned it well with a brush, made sure nothing was jammed. And it still quit grinding anything more than a dusting on the espresso setting. Very disappointed!"

The only issue I've had is static, I've tried tapping the side of the glass to settle it down, but it \"jumps\" out of the canister. Nothing I've tried has helped the static and it is really bad, more than just an annoyance, but I just deal with it. Grinds do collect now and then where the glass jar sits in the grinder because the coffee \"jumps\" out of the top when I pull the jar out. Overall I recommend this grinder! The static is minor compared to the quality I get from this machine!"

I mostly got it based on the price point for my budget and that a couple local reputable roasters in my area recommended it for pour over coffee. I've had it now for a couple weeks and use it mostly on the weekends for the aforementioned pour over where I'm still trying to find the best coarseness setting. I also use it for auto-drip grinding during the work work (medium setting).\nMy only complaint is the catch container does not handle static very well at all and there is always clinage and grround dust escaping. I am usually grinding about 20-25 grams from a medium to coarse grind and it happens every time. Also after removing the container if you move the grinder at all some residual grounds fall through and make a little mess but that's probably normal for this design.\nOverall it produces even grounds as expected and is such an improvement over a normal blade style grinder."

If you\u2019re home and don\u2019t mind wiping your counters down whenever you use it and are on a reasonably tight budget, this might be suitable.\n\nAs for me, I don\u2019t think I can return it, but I will be picking up another brand that\u2019s been a tad more reliably to me in the past."

The top is sealed, so you can store about 1/2 pound of whole beans in the cone. The glass jar is nice -- stays cleaner than plastic, and is less static-y, but there is still some static, so your counters won't be pristine. But there is less of the jumping-bean problem than other grinders. The container for the ground beans has a top on it, so you can grind some coffee the night before -- if you don't want to wake anyone the next morning -- and the ground coffee will stay pretty fresh because the top provides a pretty good seal. It takes a bit of trial and error to grind just the right about of coffee, because the amount is measured in seconds of grinding time. Strange, but it works. About 15 seconds provides the right amount of coffee for water up to level \"6\" in my coffee machine."

The styling is the best I have seen for burr grinders too. Others tend to be very agricultural looking. And...to top it off, it was the least expensive of all the mid to high end burr grinders. Oh, I forgot to mention that the grind is very consistent and ranges from very coarse to very fine. It should cover all coffee and espresso needs. Now, let's hope it lasts a while."

If you have left over beans and wanted a larger amount, you have to wait 5 minutes in between turning it on again, or it can ruin the machine (read it in the manual).

The price is now down to 20 cents per usage. Great product!\n\nUpdate March 4, 2014\n\nStill working fine. I still use it twice daily. I notice that the required grind time is slightly longer than it used to be and it will no longer grind as course as I would like. For anything other than a french press the grinder still has a lot of life left. So here is the math. I have ground roughly 1,150 batches of coffee. I paid 112 for the drinker. Since it still works fine for a finer grind I will donate it to the local thrift store and use it as part of my tax deductions. So the per use cost is down to 9 cents. Can't beat the price versus life combination. Not sure I will buy the same grinder again. I need a fairly course grind so this is not the best choice.\n\nI might add that I buy green beans from Sweet Maria's [...] and roast them at home in a Fresh Roast 500. After accounting for the purchase of the roaster and grinder, the per batch cost is much lower than buying pre roasted beans and you will not believe the taste difference.

The coarse grind is inconsistent. if your a french press connoisseur look elsewhere. you will have some sludge in your press unless you sift through it. still love it for espresso and drip. Also i have read that the glass container reduces static, well i can say that in the dry winter here in salt lake it is still very very clingy. the backing on the grinder where the grind container sets against is very flimsy, which is a non-issue if your not moving it by it. also if your worried about aesthetics, the green the colors doesn't match. Being a man i don't care as long as it grinds my beans :). it isn't the easiest grinder to clean either. while i love the texture of the plastics everything sticks to it including oils on your hand(with light colored grinders). none of these issues have caused me to dock stars. I think the start/stop button feels a little flimsy. so i am very careful with it especially after my first go around. Also as some have commented that a fair amount of grinds get stuck in it. You can tap and shake it, most of the grinds will come out, Most. I would recommend a can of compressed air(do it outside its messy). Also read on some reviews that this machine is not adequate enough for espresso. while this is a subjective topic, i disagree the grinds seem very consistent and fine. If its not extracting well enough you can try increasing tamp pressure, decreasing run time and increase the amount of grounds slightly. I have been getting some good espresso very full and flavorful with a nice layer of crema. also do not use distilled water(two reasons taste and some machines can't read the water level due to lack of conductivity).\n\nupdate 11/14/15\nStill working no issues\n\nps. i love amazon :)"

One thing I didn't like about a lot of other grinders I looked at was the coarseness selection mechanism, as a lot of them were kind of flimsy or had to be oriented in a certain way when attaching the hopper. This one sort of clicks into place. I wasn't keen on the plastic top to the hopper at first, but it is good quality and keeps everything dust free. It also has a nice join so the lid is not just wiggling around up there.\n\nThe start button is timed, so you don't have to hold it down for the duration of the grind. It is not like a wind-up kitchen timer in that it doesn't tick down to zero. It is less likely to break this way and I can keep it on the setting I use each morning."

Loud enough that I wondered if it was safe to operate. Contacted BODUM, they basically said sorry, nothing they can do. At basically $100 to purchase, that puts it at $50/year. Pretty expensive, if you ask me. My previous blade grinder lasted over 10 years, couldn't have been more that $25. I know, blade grinders and burr grinders, apples/oranges. But if you're looking for value, this might not be the one. Spouse really likes that it's quieter, so we're going to give it another try, just bought a new one (fool me once...). We'll see, fingers crossed. You can bet we're going to register this one."

And yes, there are some fine grinds that static electricity causes to stick to the counter and the machine a bit, but it's no big deal if you're careful. A little wipe-up, not a big stinking mess. My husband grinds for drip coffee and I grind for espresso, and we've both been very happy with this burr grinder. We previously had a blade grinder, and it was a noisy nightmare that had very inconsistent results in the grind quality. This grinder makes a moderate level of noise, as I'm sure most would, but it's somewhat muffled and not a high, shrieky, unbearable sound. I'm very noise sensitive, and I've not been bothered by the sound of this machine at all. We're cheapskates, and I initially balked at spending this much money on a grinder, but I got tired of having to have Starbucks grind mine for me, and having them get stale before I used them. I've not regretted the money I spent on it AT ALL. In short, this is one of the best appliance purchases we've made in 28 years of marriage! I think you'll be pleased with this product."

I guess the grind will be OK to use with the pressurized basket but I haven't tested it yet. I also found online some information about modifying this grinder so that it gives a finer grind. It does not look like the easiest thing to do and there's risk of breaking the machine.

I returned the grinder for replacement and although the timer now remains on for a bit longer than the first unit, the ten second setting only grinds coffee for six seconds. I read in another review how if you hold the bean container while grinding, the grinder will remain on longer but this seems a lot to ask of a user given the price and pedigree of the appliance. Calls and email to Bodum customer service were unavailing although one representative I spoke with did say that she had heard complaints about this previously. Even she seemed unconcerned, however. All she advised was to return the unit to Amazon which I did with not entirely satisfactory results. It seems to me that Bodum may have a design issue with the burr grinder which needs their attention."

The Bodum Bistro (red) was the less expensive of two grinders that I'd reduced my choices to, and based on the positive reviews, I decided to take a chance on it, rather than spend half again as much on the only other product in competition for my cash. I've only had it two days, but am already more than satisfied, and actually quite impressed.\n\nI don't do espresso at home, so I cannot speak to the finer end of the grind spectrum, but I do make press coffee daily, so a consistent semi-coarse grind with minimal dust is essential to a good cup. This thing delivers. The specified grind (labeled by a little press-pot icon on the adjustment marks) is a bit coarse for my tastes, but two marks finer is just about perfect. Eight seconds is about right for a mug, and there's very little sludge left at the bottom of the cup. It's hard to imagine a better grinder without spending substantially more money.\n\nConstruction is excellent. Parts fit securely and precisely, and the overall feel is that of a quality product. The glass receptacle does an excellent job of keeping static cling minimized, and the seal formed by the rubber lid seals well against the grinder's output chute, keeping grounds where they belong, rather than on the counter, and noise down to a non-objectionable level--actually a significant improvement over my much cherished Solis, even before the overworked bearings started to squeal like an angry pig.\n\nI'm absolutely thrilled with my purchase, so far, and if this lasts half half as long as the Solis did, I'll still consider this a great bargain amongst conical burr grinders. Hats off to Bodum for what seems to be a great product for a very reasonable price."

I am honestly surprised at the quality and evenness of the grounds. This is on par with higher cost grinders for a fraction of the cost. Comparing this to a blade grinder or a flat burr grinder like the Mr. Coffee BVMC-BMH23 is no comparison at all. The additional cash over the cost of the Mr. Coffee is worth every penny and makes a world of difference.\n\nThe conical hopper has not bound up once stopping the beans from sliding into the grinder. I was hesitant about having a glass bin that holds the grounds, but it seems like it will not easily crack or break, and seems to cut back on the grounds sticking to the sides better than plastic bins.\n\nI tend to grind from fresh beans, but it seems like the seal on the hopper lid and the seal to the bin would help to maintain freshness of beans if you would want to fill the hopper all the way up.\n\nCleaning and maintaining has been easy. Cleaning the burr internals is as simple as using a brush to wipe down what little grounds there are and making sure the burrs are in good shape.\n\nIt took a couple grinds in the beginning to get the time set right to grind the proper amount of coffee, but the timer works well and seems to maintain consistent grind times.\n\nThe solitary knock against the grinder is that the most course grind is still a bit too fine for French press. It is course enough that grounds do not get through the French press filter, but fine enough to cause a slight bit of clogging."

It grinds perfect beans from a fine espresso to a coarse grind for presses, quite happy as I use several methods of brewing coffee. I love coffee and use an espresso machine or a french press or a single cup filter drip depending on my mood. Hence I needed a machine that could grind these different formats well, this Bodum Bistro does it. There is a bit of static (minimal) even with the glass beaker, but it is all contained in the beaker thanks to the lid. There are no dust grounds anywhere outside of the beaker after grinding and removing it!! I should also mention that it's not as loud as the others mentioned, but it's certainly not quiet either.\nWhy the 4 stars then(4 1/2 is more like it actually)? It's the timer function that knocks it down a tad. It has a maximum of 20 seconds before they recommend you let it cool for 5 minutes before grinding again. This really hasn't been a problem, per se, as I usually brew single cups in the ways I stated earlier. However, the 20 second time limit is not enough to grind an amount useful for a 10 cup drip coffee maker. So you might have to prepare beans in advance if using a larger drip brewer, I've actually used the machine in 2 20 second grinds back to back without ill effects so far(I rarely have to brew a whole pot of coffee). But like I said they recommend a cooling down after 20 seconds..."

After reading the reviews, I got the Bodum Bistro Electric Burr Coffee Grinder. I tend to let appliances intimidate me. Sometimes I'll keep them for years before reading the instructions and getting on with using them. This was not intimidating at all. Plug it in, toss the whole beans of your choice in the top, adjust it to grind from fine to coarse, your choice, turn it on, and hit the grind button.\n\nI have mine set on 10 seconds. That makes a little more than I need for a cup, but it makes it easier to scoop out. You just pull out the little glass container once the grinding stops, scoop out your freshly-ground coffee, and put the little glass container back in its slot. You can have the pleasure of playing around with the settings all you want. It's easy. Even though I like to put as few things on my counter tops as possible, this is one appliance I'm happy to display. I chose black because I wanted a classic look. They have a variety of colors, black, white, red, and what appears to be lime green, enough choices to please anyone. I highly recommend this burr coffee grinder."

A bit of research revealed that the plastic gears inside had crapped out. Since Bodum has the usual one-year warranty, I'm out of luck. For $90 (what I paid for it on Amazon), this is ridiculous. My previous grinder lasted close to 10 years before finally giving up the ghost, and I only grind about two cups' worth of coffee once a day. And trust me, there was no pebble in my coffee beans, which I inspect as I pour in, not to mention they came from from a major US retailer that screens out such things. As far as the grinder's performance BEFORE its untimely demise, it seemed to work fine. However, the borosilicate glass is rather a joke, since it actually seems to make static cling worse, not better. The main benefit to me of this coffee grinder is that it's quieter than most (and cuter). But having it die after just a year cancels out the slight advantage of those things. I recommend you skip it."

It holds a couple of days worth of beans in the hopper so it makes grinding beans a lot less tedious. The machine does cause some static that causes grounds to stick to the glass receptacle at times, which can cause a bit of the grinds to go wherever they want and cause a bit of a mess. Not nearly as bad as the ones with plastic receptacles, which spill grounds all over the place. I would certainly buy this one again."

For me, this was typically eight tablespoons.\n\nThe easiest way to make the morning coffee is to use this grinder. At the start of the week or whenever, load a supply of beans in the bean reservoir. Each morning grind for about 12-15 seconds. The ground coffee drops into the removable, covered glass container. Pour the ground coffee into the basket for the coffee maker from the glass container. Once a week or so clean the coffee grinder.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised to find that in addition to preparing better coffee, the coffee preparation process is easier for me.

In the former grinder the beans often became \"bridged\" over the feed to the burrs, i.e., they would not fall down from the hopper into the grinder proper. It's as if gravity was suspended. With the Bodum Bistro grinder, I have experienced no such gravitational aberrations. I get a clean grind every time. I am also using less coffee. The Bodum produces uniform particles, from fine to coarse, my choice. With the former grinder, I often got a mixture of powder and a non-uniform grind. I get such good results with the Bodum that I've returned to using my French press. I like, too, that the grounds receptacle is made of glass, not plastic. The benefit here is there is no static electric charge that turns the grounds receptacle into a mini atomic collider with the resultant random particle discharge. This is a cool little machine, folks. Hawkmeister sez... Five Stars."

The Cuisinart was VERY loud and we would only use it when nobody in the home was asleep. (Also, it would make our dog spaz out!) We thought (through those years) that it did a good job, and we always preferred fresh ground beans over store ground. However, after using this Bodum burr grinder, we now realize how much we missed over those years! This grinder is MUCH quieter, the grind is MUCH more consistent, and it's easier to clean the grounds container.\n\nWe use the auto drip setting and the grounds are perfect for our machine with cone filter. We use good beans and find that about 5 sec per 2 cups works well. For example, 20 seconds of grounds = 8 \"cups\" of water in our drip machine, and results in nice, dark coffee. (Realize that 8 \"cups\" in our drip machine results in about 3 or 4 regular sized coffee cups of drink.) When making 10 \"cups\" a bit stronger, we run 20 sec then 10 sec and don't experience any problems with grinder heating or shutdown.\n\nWe find that a 12 oz bag of coffee in the old grinder would last a week, where the same amount in this Bodum grinder lasts almost twice as long, with better tasting coffee. I think the problem with the old grinder was the poor grind quality, which required more beans to produce dark, end-result coffee.\n\nWe have noticed some static in the glass container since fall/winter air dryness have arrived, but it's not a show-stopper based on the other advantages of this machine, and it's very easy to simply run it under cold water after emptying the grinds into the filter. We love it and are very happy with the purchase!"

So making a pot of 4 cups takes the full twenty seconds of grinding. If you tend to consume a full 10-12 cup pot of coffee each day, this grinder may not be the right size for you. It is the perfect size for me since I tend to make 4 cup pots as that is what fits nicely in my travel cup.\n\nSome have mentioned that they thought this grinder was noisy. It was surprisingly quiet to me for a grinder. I can run this in the quiet of morning and it doesn't seem \"loud\" to me at all.

I haven't tried any competing products, so I don't know if they're somehow significantly better, but I can say I'm very happy with this and will likely purchase another. Its grinds have been very consistent, and I don't think I've ever performed any maintenance or anything on it."

It's really a moot point - for french press coffee, the entire holding container fills in 20 seconds so it's really pointless to need to run it longer than that.\n\nThe issue with static is real, however. Nothing a damp cloth can't fix. The constant cleaning, however, is why I deducted one star from this unit.\n\nI use this at the office for french press and it is perfect. It makes enough for the largest size (12 cup) Bodum french press carafe.\n\nI own a Gaggia MDF Burr Grinder at home and I can honestly say that this unit that costs 1/3 the price of the Gaggia actually grinders faster.\n\nThe plastic lid to the hopper is a little 'cheap' but (for now) it does create an air-tight seal. If you are a coffee snob, however, you won't be storing any beans in the hopper anyhow!\n\nOverall, get this unit. Great burr grinder on a budget. I do not regret it."

I'm getting an insanely consistent and fine grind, and I'm not losing any oil or heating my grinds too much.\n\nI've read a few reviews of how gears and such break down over time. So far, I see no cause for concern. I will say this tho, if so many people didn't use such oil laden beans like Starbucks, then grinders all over the world wouldn't be crapping out. It's not the beans themselves that wear on gears and burrs alike, but the oil in the coffee which coats all the parts and makes the machine work harder. Try switching to a lighter roast that actually taste like coffee. Your tastebuds and your grinder will thank you."

I have owned several coffee grinders. Blade types are useless in my opinion and the Cuisinart burr grinder that I owned was a joke. Several years ago I purchased a Starbuck's Barista Burr grinder that did the job very well, however it spewed grinds all over creation. It died while I was grinding Starbuck's Espresso coffee beans that happened to have a rock in the beans. I bought the newest version of the same Starbuck's grinder about 3 years ago and enjoyed it except for the spewing of grinds all over the counter. I then read several reviews and watched a user's home video on Amazon for the Bodum Bistro and was impressed by what I read and saw. I bought the Bodum Bistro Burr Grinder and love it! It does a great job grinding coffee and there is no mess. It is easy to clean and I think it is attractive. The only strange feature is that it isn't supposed to be used for more than 20 seconds without allowing it to cool for 5 minutes before the next use. Weird, but hasn't been a problem for me. Happy grinding!"

Bodum just doesn't want customers to think it is a commercial unit, which it isn't. Commercial units cost many hundreds of dollars. It is noisy on recently awakened ears to be sure. My only complaint is that the conical burr isn't removable for cleaning, and it is a real bear to clean. It has to be inverted and a toothbrush doesn't quite fit down to the base of the burr. A 4.75 is more accurately my rating, but I still give it 5 stars because at under $100, it is a solid value."

            "reviewText": "I just wrote a blog post with a detailed review of this coffee maker as compared to three separate burr grinders (including a 7 minute video):\n\n[...]\n\nBelow is the text of the review (if you copy & paste the URL above, you'll get pictures & can watch the video, etc.)\n\nI'm exploring how to make great coffee.\n\nThe thing about making great coffee is that it means something different to everyone. Here's what it means to me: The coffee is dark and flavorful. It doesn't taste like it's watered down. It has a great aroma and makes me smile when I drink it. I guess this blog is really about how to maximize the `smile' factor.\n\nI'm no coffee pro or snob. Just a guy who wants better-than-average coffee. My colleague Jeremia, who knows a heck of a lot more about coffee than I do, just informed me the other day that the lighter blends actually have more caffeine than darker blends, because the caffeine is roasted out of coffee the longer it roasts. Now there's a guy who knows his coffee. To thank him for that pearl of knowledge, I just bought him some raw Luwak coffee, straight from Indonesia. We'll see what he does with that bad boy.\n\nToday I tested three burr coffee grinders to figure out which one was best: the Capresso 560 Infinity Conical Burr Grinder , Bodum Bistro Electric Burr Coffee Grinder, and Mr. Coffee BVMC-BMH23 Automatic Burr Mill Grinder . Previously we had been using the Capresso 464.05 CoffeeTeam GS 10-Cup Digital Coffeemaker with Conical Burr Grinder but the coffee just wasn't coming out with enough flavor.\n\nSo here's the new plan: Test these 3 burr grinders, pick the one that grinds the best coffee, and then use a Zojirushi Premium Thermal 1.85 liter Carafe, Brushed Stainless Steel carafe along with a No. 6 filter size plastic filter cone (which fits perfectly inside that model carafe) and boil water on the stove to run through it. (My guess is that the CoffeeTeam GS didn't make \"high smile factor coffee\" because it didn't ge the water hot enough. Just speculation on my part though, all I can say is that it wasn't as good).\n\nThis new plan is actually going back to the old plan -- my wife and I were boiling water and running it through the filter cone + carafe before with great \"smile factor\" results, but the burr grinder we had been using, the Black & Decker CBM210 Stainless Steel Burr Coffee Mill/Grinder , was a pain because we had to hold the button down while it was grinding. It also made inconsistent sized grounds. So after trying the CoffeeTeam GS because I thought it'd be easier (wake up timer!) I'm back to the manual original burr grinder + boiling water + filter cone + carafe approach. This time, hopefully, with a better burr grinder.\n\nThe winner for me was the Bodum Bistro Electric Burr Coffee Grinder because of its hardened steel burr grinding mechanism, ability to easily turn it on & off, and glass holder receptacle. The Capresso 560 Infinity Conical Burr Grinder was quieter, but annoyingly, the timer can't be stopped -- you have to wait for it to time out. The Mr. Coffee BVMC-BMH23 Automatic Burr Mill Grinder was a total fail because of its inferior burr grinder design.\n\nPlease leave your own opinions and comments on my blog. Especially if you have tips on how to make higher smile factor coffee. Oh and by the way, I put agave sweetener in my coffee instead of sugar (available at Costco). Lower glycemic index = happier body."

One thing I was unsure of when purchasing it was whether the grind would be consistent. I will say that the fine coarseness settings are nice and very consistent. But the coarser the setting, the less consistent the grind. I expected this based on the other reviews. But even with the less consistent, coarse settings, it's not too far off. It's more than good enough for my purposes and I bet most others. Considering the price, that tiny weakness is negligible. I can't say my coffee would turn out noticeably better if I spent over $100 on a grinder that is more consistent at coarser settings.\n\nOne thing I wish is that the timer dial would move as it grinds, to show how much time is left. It doesn't make any practical difference, it would just be a nice touch.\n\nIt looks very nice on my countertop, too! I get compliments on it. Good bonus."

I like how it has pictures at the different settings (espresso, drip, press) for quick adjustments. It's a fine looking machine, it's quieter than other models (Cuisinart), it has a glass container instead of plastic so it's better with static cling (still has it though).

I don't drink expresso, so I can't speak to that, and I would certainly take the word of others who say this grinder is not ideal for expresso. I've watched several videos on this grinder and others by coffee experts who also agree this grinder doesn't grind fine enough for expresso, but is great for all other.\n\nI've used it for drip, pour-over and press methods. I LOVE it! It's very quiet compared to the various blade grinders I've used. It looks great on the counter and I love that it's not messy at all.

I do not brew espresso, so I'm not sure how well it would do small grind for espresso maker. Footprint is relative small compared to other burr grinders.

The only challenge is when you would like to mix/blend different type of coffee beans, not very possible unless you pre-mix and hope you put enough in for only one grind. Once beans in you cannot take the bean holder off without beans going all over the place. If you are a one type of blend family than probably not an issue. It is a bit loud, but with a 20-sec max grind time not really issue unless you are living in a studio APT. My only worry is with an on/off button that you need to use every day - my guess is that that switch will ultimately fail long before the grinder does.

MOST importantly, I agreed that I didn't want static cling coffee grinds to fight with first thing in the morning, and the glass borosilicate container is easy to clean out. I'm SO glad I bought the Bodum! I like the silicone texture on the exterior for a good grip. The simple design is nice on the counter and there are more levels of grind available than I'll ever use, but it's great to have the option! I agree, there can be a bit of \"drift\" of a few coffee grounds when you grind but I don't make a lot at one time (just a couple cups worth) so it doesn't seem too messy to me. I would definitely recommend this product!"

            "reviewText": "I've been using this for several months. Overall it has worked very well for me except when using the coarsest setting for a french press (more on this later). I don't do expresso so I can't really comment on that. But for a regular auto-drip it produces an excellent and *consistent* grind. In the past my biggest issue with low end burr grinders is the inconsistent grind (for all settings). On the Bodum, it really is consistent.\n\nUnfortunately I found the grind on the coarsest setting isn't as coarse as it should be (that is, compared to grinding with a store's machine or having Starbucks do it). See the uploaded pics from another reviewer (where he has a dime in the pic as a reference point), that's exactly how it is with mine. This results in a bit more sediment sludge in the last cups when using my french press. Nothing ridiculous, but I tend discard the last cup from the press. The Bodum produces far less dust/sludge than my previous low end grinders, so at least it's a big improvement over that. But I do wish the coarse grind was a bit larger.\n\nCleaning is pretty easy. If you don't have one of those cleaning brushes, get one! Occasionally I take it out to the backyard and blast the inside & nooks/cranies with canned air.\n\nOne last comment I wanted to make on the 20 second timer issue many people have complained about (i.e. having to let it cool down for 5 minutes). Oddly enough, a gent from Bodum USA customer service told me not to worry about that. He said not to worry about burning out the motor and it's perfectly fine to immediately restart the grinding for the last amount of beans still in the hopper. In my case, I only need about 5 additional seconds, so that's what I've been doing. It hasn't caused any problems for me (knock on wood). It's up to you if you wish to do the same. You may want to call customer service yourself and get their input."

I got used to cleaning up the counter up to a foot or more away from the coffee pot with every use.\n\nThe glass receiver in the Bodum limits this issue almost completely. After cleaning the counter 300 or more times a year for 15 years, elimination of this chore alone merits the higher cost of the Bodum.\n\nThe grind from blade machines has haphazard consistency. The Bodum grind is as consistent throughout as I have ever seen with a home machine.\n\nThe timer is a nice convenience. Once calibrated to the amount you need, one push of the red button and the fresh ground is ready.\n\nDoes just what I want done conveniently, without making more work for me."

It wasn't horribly expensive, and has a good assortment of grinding options. Course and fine on this machine are totally different beasts. If you're thinking that 5 minutes of turning a hand-crank grinder won't get old every day; you'd be surprised. With this machine, your beans are done in 20 seconds (or more like 2 sets of 15 if you like 8 cups of coffee). It's stylishly designed, and the only real flaw is not having volumetric markings on the fill cone. I'm chucking my old hand grinder, this thing is perfect for me (not uber-connoisseur, but know enough about coffee stuff to not buy the cheapest, or anything outrageously expensive, as the taste won't vary a great deal once you buy fresh beans and grind them yourself before brewing). Would recommend to any of my coffee-lover friends!"

However, when my molina would not grind evenly or consistently, not to mention having to stand there and hold it down, I finally gave in. So I read lots of reviews and purchased this grinder, and I cannot even begin to tell you how wonderful it is. It was worth every cent and more. It evenly grinds (I use rather oily beans)perfectly every time. But what I love the most is its settings, so that you can not only get the consistency you want, but the exact amount you need using the timer and their grind settings. Not only do I not need to stand there and hold the grind button down and \"guess\", but it saves me money as well as time. I highly recommend it!"

I usually grind the coffee he takes with him on the road, because he is now spoiled and cannot drink anything but french roast Starbucks. I ruined him, he drank Folgers when I met him. I had replaced my Cuisinart burr grinder with this grinder, and am so disappointed. My Cuisinart burr grinder was great, could grind coarse enough for french press, and fine enough for espresso. This grinder cannot do that. The french press setting is TOO coarse, the drip setting is too coarse and the espresso setting is not even close to being fine enough for my machine. The coffee comes out pale and weak, and not good at all. I am irritated because this grinder is not exactly cheap, and really not the high quality I was expecting. I have tried contacting the company and have gotten no response. I think for the price, and the lack of customer service, and this grinders poor settings make it a waste of money. Now I am back in the same boat of trying to find an affordable burr grinder that works really well. Two thumbs down!"

I went back to a blade grinder and was happy with the coffee I made that way. However, after reading repeatedly that an even grind makes better coffee, I decided to try again and ordered the Bodum Bistro. I just tried it for the first time. I put in the amount of beans that I normally use for my 48-ounce morning pot (drip). On the maximum time setting, 20 seconds, the grinder only got through about two thirds of the beans before shutting off. Since I didn't want to wait 5 minutes to grind the rest, I tried making my coffee with the amount it ground in 20 seconds. It isn't as strong as I like it. The grind is even and I didn't have a static problem, but the short duty cycle makes this grinder a poor choice for people who like to brew more than a couple of cups at a time, unless you like your coffee weak or don't mind waiting 5 minutes to grind two batches."

One star knocked off for that.\n- Bean holder is a waste of time, unless you want stale coffee sitting in the grinder.\n\nOverall for a conical burr grinder, for espresso, it's a solid purchase.

We found that the french roast that we typically grind finally clogged up the works after all these months however we did not know what the problem was initially. Took it apart and cleaned it especially the tube where the ground coffee flows to the cup. It was completely clogged. Had to really pick at it and use a vacuum.

            "reviewText": "I've been drinking coffee for years now and know a good cup from bad. I bought this unit after doing lots of research online and going to local stores and inspecting the grinders up close. I found that most machines in this price range are using ABS plastic where the burrs are located. This to me is a big NO NO and a huge red flag. The ABS will break. This unit uses nylon or UHMW plastic at first glance. These plastics are more ductile and will last. Being a machinist, i am very picky with build quality. The burr set is conical and looks to be Stainless Steel or somesort of hardened steel. Nonetheless, both good options and the burrs look very nicely built. They have been machined and ground and look a lot like burr sets you'd see in units that are 2-3 times the price. The outside of the machine is wrapped in rubber and looks nice. The top hopper is a clear plastic, but seems strong, especially where it matters (the point where it meets the machine). The container receiving the grind is GLASS wrapped in rubber. This is great!! No static, which means, NO MESS! My first attempt at a burr grinder was poor. I just bought something from the local superstore without any research. It had flat burrs and rotated at the speed of sound, or so it seemed. Everything was plastic and grinds flew everywhere. Hated that thing!\n\nI'd say the only thing that may bother some, is that the timer goes 20 secs. Now for me this is more than enough, but for others its not nearly the time they would need. Bodum recommends after 1 20sec run to leave the machine idle for 5 mins to prevent the motor from overheating(i read the manual). I thought this would be an issue for me, but my daily use only requires a 10 sec run at a time which delivers about 1/2 the jar or enough grind to yield about 3-5 cups(my small french press is 3cup capacity, which is really 1 mug). I am not grinding for espresso and have not tried the finest setting yet, but intend to and wish i had to make this review more complete, but my results so far are very consistent and from what i can see im sure itll do a fine enough grind for espresso and if not, im sure it can be modded easily enough to provide. I plan to start into the world of home espresso extractions, but not at this time as im still experimenting with other methods.\n\nAlso if you were to use for espresso, it looks to me that you could easily remove the bottom jar, pop the portafilter in place(obviously holding it) and run the machine. The grind should fall nicely into the portafilter.\n\nUPDATE (JAN 10/2011): I'm still using my grinder after 2-3 months and I still love it! I've started grinding for espresso with great results. Glad to see that most everyone is as content as I am with this little guy! Clean up is a breeze, and its never once clogged up on me personally, although i read one review where someone said theirs did. Happy Grinding!\n\nUPDATE (April 2012): Grinder is still working great. I have some concerns. The glass jar has a very thin bottom and if your using anything other than a softer utensil, will break. I found a small hole in mine after a lot of use with a spoon. I've since been using a wooden spoon. My fix for this hole was tape.\n\nMy espresso 'machine' up to this point has been a Presso. The bodum at its finest setting works great with the Presso. Any finer and you'd never be able to pull a shot without breaking the Presso (which i've done). I've since bought a machine and with the pressurized basket the grind is consistent enough and fine enough to yield good results. Since I enjoy tweaking equipment to some degree, my next step is a single walled basket and bottomless portafilter. The bodum will in my opinion not grind fine enough for this set up. I have a hario mini for now, but looking to buy a more expensive grinder for espresso. The bodum will be for drip and french press which I believe it does a great job at. One thing about the bodum as compared to more expensive units is the bodum is quite light in comparison. I feel if the bodum was a heavier machine with more use of metals rather than plastics, it could probably be set up to grind finer and be a wonderful machine overall. But at this price point this is what you get, and for the money, it does a nice job.\n\nOne other thing, I roast my own beans and when I first started roasting the bean consistency was not perfect due to the method. This resulted in the bodum actually skipping during operation. I stopped it quickly enough as to not destroy it, but was a little alarmed. Now that I've changed my methods for roasting, the beans are always consistent and the bodum grinds them no problem.\n\nUPDATE Dec 2012: I still use the bodum daily. It is a superb grinder for the money and I am glad it has served me so well. I tested the bodum against the Hario Mini and my friends Baratza Virtuoso grinder and found that even though the Hario and Baratza will grind finer, the bodum produces the most consistent grind, hands down! Considering the Baratza is triple the price I'd say I was quite surprised. You can get finer grind from the bodum, but I don't take any responsibility for anyone modifying their machine. I took the top burr out, and found that there are two tabs (plastic section that houses the burr) that sit on the threaded section of the bottom burr which allow for the grind settings. You will notice 2 beveled edges. If you sand these down slightly the top burr will come closer to the bottom burr. I took measurements before starting with calipers and started working from there. This does work well, just be careful as moving the burrs closer could cause them to rub against each other."

The grounds cup is easy to remove (and re-insert) without spilling. I like that the lid is completely separate, which reduces spilling and makes it easier to clean. The glass significantly reduces (but does not entirely eliminate) static, which is a marked improvement over our prior grinders. (Although the static is not entirely eliminated, what little static there is is confined to the insider of the container and DOES NOT spill all over the place. It's really not an issue.) My only minor complains are that it's louder than other grinders and it doesn't have a very long timer (though it's long enough to grind enough coffee a 3/4 pot for me and my wife). So far, so good.

Living in dry Texas, static is a problem, which is why I tried the Bodum grinder for it's glass grind receptacle.\n\nThe 20 second grind limit is a minor problem when using my 12-cup automatic drip machine, but I use the 5 minute wait between grinds to clean and fill the coffee machine.\n\nWhen I first started using the grinder, I would run it for two consecutive 20-second grinds. I did this for about 3-4 months with no problems. Then I read an article about improving your coffee that discussed avoiding long grind times so as to not burn your beans on overheated burrs.\n\nSince then, I would grind for 20 seconds, go through the rest of my coffee prep tasks, then grind another 20 seconds. Not really much of an inconvenience.\n\nI also learned from the article that grinders with conical burrs tend to work better. This grinder has a conical burr.\n\nThe grind produced is perfectly even; and the round shape of the receptacle makes it easy to sweep out the grinds.\n\nI will definitely buy another when mine dies (though I hope my grinder lasts a few more years)."

There are some engineering compromises that you should be aware of, however. The motor has no internal cooling and there is liberal use of nylon parts. So if you make huge pots of coffee, say, more than four cups of brew at a time, or drink a lot of Espresso, a more expensive heavy-duty unit would be a better choice.\n\nNote: this grinder has a fuse to protect the motor and electronics in case the burrs get stuck for whatever reason. Replacing this fuse requires complete teardown and reassembly, but it can be done."

The hopper is generous and can be removed for easy cleaning (good coffee beans are naturally oily). The best part is the glass receptacle, though. It's much less messy than the plastic Capresso. It doesn't have any corners that can trap grounds, and it doesn't have a static cling effect that always resulted in stray coffee grinds on my counter.\n\nI haven't found a reliable \"time\" of grinding for my 8 cup Bodum french press. It's around 25 seconds, but the timer on the grinder tops out at 20. As a result, I have to measure the coffee into the pot each time. That's not a bad thing, though, as it produces a more consistent brew."

I have two friends who are coffee snobs, one is a barista at Capogiro in Philly and one is a on again off again barista at his friend's coffee shop in Bala Cynwyd. Upon a recommendation from the latter friend (also my roommate) I started research Burr coffee grinders. He owns the Bodum french press, and I love that thing to death so I was happy with the reviews and modern style of the bodum coffee grinder. I wanted a green one but it was a surprising 10$ more than the black at the time. So far, the grinder has been a joy to work and live with. It is fast, efficient and I have had ZERO problems so far. I have owned it for maybe a month. Perfect espresso, perfect course ground, perfect for the first time user. My snobby roommate is more than satisfied as well.\n\nUpdated 10/8/2015: I have never had problems with my Bodum Bistro! It still grinds at all different settings, it's fast, a little noisy, but so efficient. It's a bit bulky to keep on the kitchen counter, so I store underneath in a cabinet, but it's so light that taking it out twice or so a week is easy. A previous roommate (NOT the one mentioned in my first review lol), did break the glass carafe it comes with, but I found that is easily replaceable. Now, I use a small pyrex glass dish, the type that comes with a plastic lid. I grind all my coffee for the week (I am not a snob), and store in the air tight pyrex. Doubling my collection and storage into one piece of dishware is far easier than using the glass carafe the machine came with. 4 years, no maintenance needed, I clean it about every 3 months, and knock out the coffee dust after every use. I have never used for anything but coffee beans. I love this machine!!"

One minor complaint, in 20 seconds it doesn't quite grind all of the two Aeropress scoops. Easy solution, run a 20 second grind, then prepare your water and Aeropress. Once you are ready for the coffee simply hit the grind button one more time and finish off the last of the grounds, I usually let it run a few seconds after the beans are ground to clear out the loose grounds. It does take at least 10 good taps on the machine to get all the grinds out, don't want them sitting around till the next time I make coffee. The machine does not prevent you from restarting the grind immediately after the first 20 seconds is up, but I avoid doing that to maintain the longevity of the grinder."

The real annoyance however comes from the amount of grounds that remain within the chamber above the coffee grounds jar. These grounds will fall out after removing the jar, leaving a mess on the counter each time. I've now just gotten in the habit of picking up the whole grinder and smacking it about a little from every angle to ensure there's as little hanging up above as possible (this can result in knocking the clear plastic cone lose so be advised if you do this).\n\nOverall it's a great product for the price when compared to other conical burr grinders, but it's not without issues."

Ground beans go into a french press (the Frieling USA Ultimo, also from Amazon), and since we got the Bistro grinder, the consistency of the grind has meant NO problems dropping the lid on the press.

The manual says you need to let it cool between grinds. There are multiple settings for the size of grinds which is nice depending of what you need it for. The glass holder is small; again for those making small amounts at one time. When you pull the glass holder, coffee tends to fall out onto the counter. I always tap the unit before pulling it out which lessen the mess. Nice and compact and is stylish to leave out on the counter."

The 20 second grind limit is sufficient for three cups of coffee in our experience. Bodum says more than 20 seconds will overheat the motor. Really? We can't say. What to do if a large party wants coffee? I suppose I will break out the old noisy grinder!

There is a world of difference between this and a blade grinder.

My biggest complaint was that anything over 8 cups tooks longer than the 20 sec. maximum time limit. Even the beans for 8 cups needed to go over the 20 sec ever so slightly. I soon realized that several seconds were eaten up just getting the whole beans down to the burr to begin the grinding process. So I totally filled the clear top plastic container with whole beans and did several trail and error tests to figured out how long it took to grind enough beans for 4 cups of coffee. That time for us is 8 seconds. So we multiply that number by the number of cups we want and set the timer accordingly. The ease of having the beans already in the hopper and just pressing the button for the grind and not having to press it again for a full pot has been great. The first grind after you fill the hopper will take about 4 seconds longer as you will have to wait for the beans to get down in the hole where the burr mechanism is. After that it is a piece of cake. This is a definite keeper."

Doesn't make a mess when using\nMost grinders fill the air, and countertop, with grounds. This one emits the grounds into the\nglass receptacle.\n\n2. The only work involved is pushing a button\nMost grinders--surely for safety reasons--force you to hold down a button for the entire length of the grinding process. By adding a timer, this grinder lets me get around that tedious step. Just select the number of seconds for my grind, and push a button.\n\n3. Allows me to create a perfect, measured dose\nBecause it has the timing feature, I can create exactly what I need, every morning.\nI figured out that, to make coffee using my lovely Aeropress, I need to grind 7 seconds worth\nof espresso beans. I grind for 7 seconds, then throw it into the Aeropress -- no measuring\n\n4. Uses very little countertop space\n\n5. Has a generous holding tank for beans\nThis means I only have to fill it once a week.\n\n6. Precision grinding\nI can really get the exact fineness of grind I want -- from uber-coarse to uber-fine, using the easy adjustment mechanism\n\n* * * SUMMARY * * *\nOTHER grinders make one go through the tedious steps of: a) fill grinder, b) hold down button for desired amount, c) pour grounds into coffeemaker, usually spilling some precious cargo along the way, d) clean up mess on counter, e) SNEEZE because, you have an allergy to airborne coffee dust\n\nThis grinder simplifies the morning process: a) push button, b) pour contents of glass jar into coffee maker\n\n* * * WORKS BEST WITH: * * *\n1.\u00a0Nespresso Aeroccino Plus\nBest frothing system I've *ever* used.

Aeropress Stainless Steel Coffee Filter\nNo need to re-order filters forever.\n\n* * * NOTE ABOUT OTHER REVIEWS * * *\nMost of the unfavorable reviews have to do with the 20 second limit on the timer. I wouldn't ding the product for this, in fact, I think it was simply a good engineering decision. That being said, I tested what would happen by running it for 40 seconds. Motor seemed fine. I think the manufacturers just want to make sure folks don't run it for an hour, which would of course blow out a motor of this size. Also, as I wrote above, grinding for 7 seconds gives me all the Joe I need for the day."

            "reviewText": "My experience with the Bodum Bistro Electric Burr Coffee Grinder (Black) makes quite a saga. First I ordered the machine in red, thinking the cheerful, vibrant color shown on my screen would enliven the kitchen. When the grinder arrived, I was disappointed to find how dull and dreary the color is \"in the flesh.\" So I phoned Amazon Customer Service (which is dependably cooperative), and they agreed to accept the return of the machine without penalty. Thereupon I ordered the black, which, like the red before it, arrived fast and in perfect condition. I'm satisfied that the discrepancy between the red on line and the red in the actual machine is merely a matter of physics, with no intent to deceive; and my wife and I love the black -- so no \"star deduction\" so far.\n\nThen we got into grinding. The Bodum emits the reassuring sound of precision. It is the sound that well-built, sturdy, meticulously-crafted machines nearly always make, and it gives you the expectation of consistency and longevity. The consistency is immediately apparent in the uniformity of the grounds, but we'll have to see about the longevity over time. We have an automatic drip machine, so the only grind setting we use is medium, as indicated by the middle icon on the machine. Our old grinder (also a burr machine, but not conical) always produced a by-product of fine powder in addition to the medium-sized particles. With the Bodum there is none of this undesirable powder. Consequently, I can say after a week or so of use, that the flavor of our brewed coffee is noticeably improved. To summarize, the particle size of the grounds is wonderfully consistent, and this is reflected in the taste of the brew.\n\nNow to address a flaw that many other reviewers have mentioned. The grinder only runs for 20 seconds at a time. The instruction booklet tenders a caveat: allow 5 minutes before running the machine through another grinding cycle. I consider that a defect in a machine of this quality. It should be possible for the motor to run for, say, 45 seconds without overheating or sustaining damage. I drink two big mugs of coffee, and the beans necessary for that much java cannot be ground by the Bodum in 20 seconds. However, I don't stand and stare resentfully at the grinder for the next 5 minutes. I have lots of other things to do to fill in that time -- such as toasting and buttering a bagel; or frothing milk for the coffee; or mixing batter for pancakes or waffles; or beating and cooking eggs for a mini-omelet -- and so on. I'm in my 8th decade of life, I no longer go to an office or shop, and I cheerfully admit to being spoiled as hell. If I needed to bolt down my coffee and race out the door (as I once did), that 5 minutes between grindings would be a deal-breaker for me. But since that's not the case, I'm inclined not to deduct any stars for the 20-second limitation either. Call me sucker, but the integrity of the build, the consistency of the grind, and the improved flavor of the brewed coffee have me hooked. But everyone will have to decide for him/herself how important this is.\n\nI consider the Bodum Bistro Electric Burr Coffee Grinder very good value for money.\n\nNINE MONTHS LATER -- I think it's time to reconsider my original review in just one respect. I'm getting impatient waiting 5 minutes before running the grinder a second time. I now find this requirement an annoying restriction imposed by the manufacturer which should be corrected in subsequent models. Consequently, I have downgraded my rating to four stars."

            "reviewText": "This is a great little burr grinder. I have owned it and used it every day, and sometimes more than once a day, for around four months, so I cannot yet talk about its durability. I am not a purist who will insist on a burr grinder over a blade grinder, and I have not owned or used another burr grinder, so I can't compare this one with others.\nI like it for the following reasons.\n1. It grinds well at the finest setting, when I use it with my cappuccino maker\u00a0De'Longhi EC155 15 BAR Pump Espresso and Cappuccino Maker. It also grinds well for our drip maker, which we use every morning, and it produces a nice coarse grind that I have used with my French press.\n2. It produces grounds of a uniform coarseness--or fineness--which is the reason you want a burr grinder, if you want one. I confess I don't really notice a difference in taste.\n3. The grind is easy to adjust, and you can adjust the length of time the machine will grind. Hypothetically, you could produce the volume of ground coffee you wanted for the amount you were brewing: X seconds at Y coarseness for Z cups of coffee. I do not do that. See below.\n4. I think the one true advantage of a burr grinder over a blade grinder is that you can't do anything else while grinding with a blade grinder, but you can push the button on the burr grinder and go do something else, like put water in your coffee maker. That's a slim advantage, I suppose. Purists will disagree and say that the flavor of coffee ground with a burr grinder is superior. I will not contest that claim but I cannot confirm it either.\n\nCons\n1. The grinder has a narrow profile and so is not as stable as I would like. This is the only reason I rated it four stars rather than five.\n\nNotes\n1. The machine is designed for you to fill the hopper with coffee and to measure out your grounds by the number of seconds you run the grinder. On the hypothesis that light will leach out flavor from beans sitting in the clear plastic hopper, I've developed my own system for measuring out how much coffee I want to grind every time I make coffee, as I did with all my old blade grinders. So my hopper sits empty. I don't really know if this produces better coffee or not.\n2. Some reviewers have commented on the mess that this grinder makes: difficult cleanup because lots of grounds cling to the glass receptacle due to static electricity. I have found that this varies depending on the coffee I use. I use the same coffee beans for all of my coffee needs, but when I have experimented with coffees from other companies some have produced this messy result. I stick with my old brand, not because of that, but because I have not found a coffee I like better.\n\nAddendum 11/06/2019: The grinder is still working but making an awful sound that has been increasing over the past year or so. I assume I am hearing a slipping gear, perhaps due to a broken cog. The noise is accompanied by a longer grinding time. It's still doing the job, but I will probably be purchasing another soon. It has lasted about 6 years, which I suppose isn't bad for a machine with plastic gears."

It is small and compact, so it doesn't take up a lot of space on my counter. 5. As coffee grinders go, it is quiet. My routine is to pour a bunch of beans into the grinder at the beginning of the week, then grind what I need (about 5 seconds of grinding) each time I want a cup of coffee during the week."

Also, it's not too loud and it's easy to clean. I don't see what you could get in the other much more expensive ones that this one doesn't have. Of course, I don't know how it will hold up over time, but it seems well constructed and appears simply built so that I might one day be able to replace the grinder burrs, the funnel and the cup."

The first one broke a blade - the replacement blade was more expensive than the whole thing. The second was so loud I gave it away. The last one just did not handle my favorite Vietnamese bean well. It is very oily and you had to pry off the grindings every time. Further the grinding was very uneven. Some was powder; some of the rest was nearly whole unchopped beans.\n\nI have looked at burr grinders before but they were very expensive and / or reviews were not so great - although part of that is due to \"coffee prudes\".\n\nThis one gives you a great range of control over grind size - from Turkish / espresso grind, to drip, to French press. As others have said the catch jar is glass - and the oily beans do not stick to it at all. It is much quieter than any of the choppers.\n\nThe instructions are sparse - but the device is simple really. The only adjustments are time and grind. These are interactive - it takes longer to grind fine coffee than the same amount ground course. So I started out with my usual quarter cup of beans(for 8 - 6 oz cups) and a fine grind and just let it run until the beans were gone - around 22 seconds. The grind was too fine and the resulting coffee was too strong. All the coffee was being ground - no more wasted beans. So I am now back to a medium drip grind and about 12 seconds - and somewhat less than a quarter cup of beans.\nIt holds somewhat more that 8oz of beans - certainly not a pound. My beans are usually sold by the \u00bd pound so that is fine.\n\nSo this guy is a winner so far.\n\nSomeone mentioned that theirs had stalled. Actually it has a clutch in it and it is supposed to stall if something ungrindable - like a stone -gets into the bean. Beans are a natural product so it can happen. Better to stall than to wreak the mechanism.\n\n4/14/2012 - Sure enough after a year it had a jam-up. Took it apart according to the manual and pried out the offending rock. Works like a charm again.\n\n9/17/2014 After 2 1/2 years of about one pot of coffee per day the motor burned out. I think the motor was under powered to start with.\nJust purchased a highly recommended Baratza Virtuoso - Conical Burr Coffee Grinder to replace it."

I had been using a sturdy Braun blade grinder, which was fine. But despite a mention on Cooks Illustrated that the kind of grinder used in their testing of coffee makers made no difference, I opted to try a burr grinder. I hate to disagree with CI, but I find it does make a difference, and this little grinder performs really well and is a pleasure to see perched on the kitchen counter.\n\nThe Bodum Bistro Electric Burr Coffee Grinder (I have the white--and it is white, not ivory) is very simple to use, produces a perfectly even grind, and minimizes static. I typically make 6-7 cups of drip coffee, and was quickly able to determine a good coarseness and amount of time (12 sec) to produce the perfect amount to dump into my coffee maker each morning. I have the top hopper loaded with beans (which stay fresh because the lid fits snugly) and all I have to do in the morning is press the starter button, and voila. Clean up is easy (and unnecessary day-to-day, but I brush it out when I switch beans).\n\nFor storage of waiting beans or pre-ground coffee (I received about 4 lbs. of 6 different kinds of beans this Christmas, which probably inspired my upgrades), I've been using these great Bodum glass jars: [...] . The 68 oz. will hold more than a pound of beans or ground coffee, has a nice snug-fitting glass lid with a rubber ring, and it is lovely. And matches the grinder :) .\n\nAs for the coffee maker, I cannot say enough about the Technivorm Moccamaster (and [...]) [...]. Can a coffee maker really be worth $300? Yes it can (especially with the extras that Roastmasters includes). I look at it this way: is it worth $1 a day for the next 300 days to have really great coffee at home? Yes. I had been using (for 20 years) a quite nice Krups coffee maker, but the liquid produced by the Technivorm is an entirely different, smoother and yet more robust, liquid than what comes out of any other coffee maker. The coffee maker is a minimalist's joy (on/off, that's it) and the thermal carafe is an essential.\n\nWay more info than you're looking for, I'm sure. But I'll end by saying that the Bodum grinder is great, and worthy of my Technivorm. High praise indeed."

            "reviewText": "Awesome introduction to making great coffee. I am a beginner and have done the research on making a cup of coffee. My first thought was I need an expensive coffee pot. NOT TRUE. This grinder has opened my taste buds to true bliss. No matter how you make your coffee this grinder will do the job. After my research I realized being stuck with an expensive coffee pot would be just that. Stuck. I have shown off my grinder to guests by making french press and a great pot of drip for comparison. Most cannot believe how good the drip coffee is, then I serve the French press. WOW!! You will see issues about noise and size but no issues on the quality of grind. I tried it for myself and could not be happier. Makes a 10 cup pot of grounds in 1 run. Or adjust for specialty brews."

            "reviewText": "Of the big three sub-$100 burr grinders, I dislike this one the least. My first, the Capresso, died rather quickly. The Breville, which I could never get dialed in for good coffee, spewed coffee ground dust everywhere. I couldn't send it back fast enough. I'll hand it to the Bodum--it does grind tasty coffee. But the grounds collector is made of glass and I broke it within a few weeks. I contacted Bodum to ask why the replacement wasn't available on their website, and they promised that it would be there within two weeks. That was about six months ago. I'll probably move up to the Kitchen Aid when this one dies or I get tired of having a non-standard grounds collector (a glass candle holder with the candle removed)."

            "reviewText": "Caveat: I have no experience except second-hand with other burr grinders. That aside, I have found this grinder to be great for making coffee. Having not had it more than a couple months I cannot speak with authority to its durability, but so far it has shown no problems whatsoever and doesn't even leak grounds unless knocked around when the glass catcher is out. Before I bought it I noticed one reviewer who said the catcher was too thin (i.e. very delicate) which worried me slightly but in my opinion it's not any thinner than one would imagine on a device like this. Also, although Bodum recommends against running the grinder for longer than the max grind time (20 sec) within a given 5 minute window I haven't had any difficulties running two 15 second sessions pretty much back-to-back (although just watch me eat these words in two more months when it explodes or something). It is, however, pretty damned loud, but I'm not sure there exists a grinder that isn't, regardless of variety. I'm not sure what else you'd look for in a burr grinder, and wholeheartedly recommend it.\n\nUPDATE: So, it's been almost 4 years since I bought this grinder, and have used it an average of every day for that entire time without any problems. It has required zero maintenance, and I've perfected a highly-nuanced technique whereby I tap the side of the grinder a few times before removing the catcher to reduce the propensity of loose grounds to fall out."

It is quieter than the blade grinders I had previously (duh) and makes a pleasing whirring sound rather than a high-pitch scream, which is another plus.\n\nThe grounds come out uniform and there is almost no spillage whatsoever. After a 20-second grind, I slide the receptacle out, tap the side of the grinder a few times, and can easily collect any spilled particles on a finger tip.\n\nFor my purposes (almost entirely aeropress double shots) this is the perfect grinder. A single 20 second grind gives me exactly the right quantity of grounds for 2 aeropress scoops, so the whole operation takes only 25 seconds to complete.\n\nSince I have only owned this grinder for a week, I'll update this in the future if I experience any problems."

We regularly use both a French Press and a drip coffeemaker. The BODUM rocks! It leaves you free to do the prep work while it is doing its grinding. Two 20 second presses gives us 8 cups of nice, strong coffee. The Krups was messy and gave a less perfect grind. Our grinders had to be shaken while operating in order to get a reasonable grind - and it varied each time. We have had NO problem with grinding two sessions in sequence. Highly recommended!"

In July 2013, one year and five months later, the timer failed. I am still within the two year warranty so the Bodum folks say that they will replace the unit. The problem is that the model is being reworked due to switch problems and will not be back in stock until September. You will note in the review below that I commented on the power switch when the unit was new. I decided early on to leave the main power switch permanently in the ON position.\nThere are several features we like. As stated in the original review the footprint is small, the fit and finish is good and the design of the timer allows for a consistent amount of coffee. I revised the rating to two stars because of the poor quality of the power and timer switches. The grinder failed the primary test that I outlined below.\nEd A\nAugust 2013\n\nI have used the Bodum grinder for about one month. I like the fact that the unit has a small footprint and is not imposing. I purchased the black unit and am impressed with the fit and finish of the grinder. I am particularly impressed with the timer for the grind time. I have it set so that I get the exact amount of coffee needed for my cup of coffee. I brew one cup (large) at a time using a V-filter and a filter holder. Also, there is absolutely no mess around the grinder. Not one time have I had to clean ground coffee from anywhere.\nI am a little less impressed with the power switch. It feels like it is on its last leg (cheep). Also, the sealing system for the lid has what appears to be a adhesive type of seal. So far it seems to be OK: it just doesn't seem like a good system. I have no problem with the grind, however, I use only a medium setting.\nThe noise level is far from pleasing although not as bad as other grinders.\nI am happy with my purchase of the Bodum and would recommend it to others. The primary test will be to see if I get several years of service from the unit.\nEd A"

            "reviewText": "I had an inexpensive burr grinder that required you to hold a button during the entire grinding process. A drag. On a normal last-minute-to-the-office weekday morning I use pre-ground coffee, but I wanted something to conveniently enjoy fresh-ground coffee on weekends or entertaining, and although I've only used it for a couple of weeks, the Bodum seems like a great choice. I like the glass container for the grounds, and that its rubber top just fits snugly under the discharge chute so there are no clips or catches to fail or wear out. The unit is fairly quiet, and although I only grind a few scoops at a time, the hopper seems large enough for most non-commercial needs. There has been some discussion in other reviews about the 20-second limit on grinding time to prevent over-heating of the motor. In 20 seconds it doesn't quite finish grinding two rounded scoops. I just push the button again to let it do the additional 5 to 10 seconds of grinding and then stop it. My rationale is that 20 seconds is not a hard number and that it probably has some safety margin built in, and actual heating will vary with the ambient room temperature and how fine of a grind it's set for. (I use a medium grind for a drip coffee maker.) I would not use this approach to grind a significant quantity, but if you're going to the trouble of grinding fresh beans, you're probably not going to grind a whole lot in advance anyway.\nThe hopper comes off easily to expose the grinding mechanism, and I can see a difference in fineness between one grind setting the the next."

I usually grind for 20 seconds, make my first double shot, then grind again for 5 seconds, and make my seconds double shot. So far it worked fine for me.\nThe consistence of the grind appears to be good and comparable to what commercial \"Magister\" brand grinders produce.

            "reviewText": "I drink espresso, drip, and use a french press, depending on my mood. This grinder gives a perfect grind (consistency of size) for whatever I select. Moreover, I find that I use about 1/4 to 1/3 less coffee for my french press than was needed previously with my blade grinder to achieve the same intensity of flavor. (I can't say for drip and espresso since they are newly acquired home-brewing habits). Marvelous little machine! Seems really well-built. Regarding some of its quirks, the opaque instructions say to allow a 5 minute cool time in between 20 second grinds. On the rare occasions when I have needed more than 20 seconds of grind time, I have only allowed about 30 seconds of cool time, and based on smell and heat generated, I very seriously doubt I am putting the motor at any risk. (Surely 5 minutes is an \"ideal\" recommendation that puts the manufacturer at minimal risk of customer problems). Also, the directions insist that the grinder be running when adjustments to the fineness/coarseness are made. This is totally counter-intuitive and so I don't do it. I usually have it \"on\" with no beans in the hopper, but do not have it running. I have experienced no problems over about one month of use. In short, I have zero complaints about performance, although I might question the true necessity of some of the \"rules\" of operation mentioned in the instructions, although only time will tell in this regard. Now that I have used a quality burr grinder, I would never go back to a blade grinder. If you buy this machine you will enjoy sipping a quality brew and I believe you will have few if any regrets. Best wishes to you."

I've adjusted to a coarse grind, but still get some sludge in the bottom of my coffee cup! I can tell just by looking at the grinds that the size is not uniform. This is probably the biggest disappointment.\n\nThe special glass container does not eliminate static completely. It is a vast improvement over other materials, but some grinds do cling to the sides. This is not a big deal, just an observation.\n\nGrinds continue to fall out of the grinder after the glass container is removed. I tried tapping the machine on the counter to get any loose grinds to fall into the container, but that didn't always work, and it is not something I want to have to keep doing. After dumping the grinds into my filter, there will be grinds on the platform and countertop by the time I return the container to its spot. So to fix this, I put another small cup in that spot to catch the random flakes whenever I remove the glass container.\n\nThe instructions are sparse. It's easy to use once you know how. I recommend watching a video review before using it for the first time.\n\nOverall, I'm glad I bought it. For this price, it does a much better job than previous, more expensive, grinders. The noise level is not uncomfortable. The volume and timer restrictions are not a problem for me, since I only have a 2 cups a day habit.\n\n------------------------------------\n\nupdate: 12/06/2011\n\nI still use this every day and it works great. The static problem seems to get worse over time but I've gotten used to it. The lid to the container that catches the grinds is now loose and comes right off. I don't know why or when that happened. As long as the coffee tastes good, I'm happy."

As others have noted, there is some static and you have to shake the grinder or you'll end up with a build-up of dust. The dust doesn't hurt anything and comes out with the next grind but this adds stale coffee to what you just ground so gentle shaking was part of my daily ritual. The grind was consistent enough for my espresso maker and my french press; although, I did get a lot of sludge with the french press. I never found that to be a serious issue and you can always shake your grinds through a fine strainer if this bothers you.\n\nUnfortunately, my unit is now useless. The burr still turns; however, there is a distinct sound of grating plastic when the unit runs. I've never liked that the grinding chamber has plastic components and it looks like one of those components finally failed. After unscrewing the base of the unit and gently pulling the unit apart about 3 inches (too many wires to completely disassemble just for a quick look), a few ground off plastic pieces fell out. After reassembly, same grating plastic sound so I guess that's it for this Bodum.\n\nOverall, I'm pretty disappointed that this didn't last longer. I really liked this coffee grinder and took good care of it. Apart from the daily shake, this unit sat in the same place, was never dropped or damaged, wasn't used beyond the 20 second limit, and was cleaned fairly regularly. Had Bodum used metal components in the grind chamber, I think this unit would have continued working for many more years. As I said, I liked this unit and would rate it 4 stars for performance and value if only it lasted longer."

After calling and speaking with a Bodum customer service representative they explained the part can go dull and needs to be replaced. I was then shipped a new part and was back in business! Unfortunately, less than 3 months after receiving the replacement part, the coarse grinding has faded back to fine and I'm due for a new part (number 3 for those of you counting).\n\nI really enjoy this grinder, but having to call and ask for a new grinder part every 3 months is quite the annoyance.

It has a one-year warranty but my complaints to customer service have gone unanswered. Amazon sold it to me - they were no help but I am shipping it back to them anyways."

            "reviewText": "I've had this Bodum Bistro burr grinder for a couple of months now, and I've used it every day. I like it. I've always indulged myself with a good cup of coffee in the morning. I've wanted to upgrade to a burr grinder for awhile and after reading reviews on the variety found here, took the plunge and bought this one.\n\nI've found that 1 'click' coarser than the medium setting grinds the dark roast coffee beans that I typically buy just about right for my needs. The resulting grind is relatively uniform and superior to the 'boulders and dust' produced by blade grinders. The few specks of grounds that do wind up on my counter top are minor compared to my retired but trusty 25yr old Krups blade grinder, or the Cuisinart Grind Central grinder, which I find is better used as a door stop... (sorry!).\n\nLots of the reviews here complain about the 20 second limit. I've found that this isn't a problem for me. In that amount of time, it grinds 4+ rounded 2 Tbs scoops of coffee, or enough for 8 'cups' of coffee. If I'm making a bigger pot of coffee, first I grind one 20 second batch of beans. I typically wash out my pot in the morning (some friends have commented that I am a little anal about that exercise), but that coincidentally takes about 5 minutes... just about enough time to grind a second smaller batch for the rest of the coffee that I need for a bigger pot of brew. So, the 20 seconds thing, not a problem for me.\n\nThe minor complaint... bottom of the glass beaker that catches the grounds which originally came with this unit was paper thin, and after a couple of weeks, a 1/2\" almost perfectly round glass 'blank' popped out of the center of the bottom in the process of cleaning - an aparent manufacruring defect. Thanks to great Amazon customer service, a replacement grinder was out to me quickly and sits handsomly on my countertop. Excellent service provided and overall the Bodum Bistro burr grinder a good value to me."

I'm also not a big fan of adjusting the grind by twisting the top. I switch between french press (coarse grind) and espresso grind sometimes. The instructions state that you should not change the setting unless the grinder is actively working, but I do it anyway (no catastrophes so far). Otherwise, I'm not sure how you would get the grind exactly where you want it to be in time for it not to affect your grind (e.g. coarse grounds in your espresso grind)."

There is some service you need to do occasionally: the grind area will build up a residue, so it needs to be cleaned now and then. Also, the hopper will get oily so it is good to give that a scrub now and then to keep it looking clean. I really like the little glass jar, one improvement would be adding a spout since i dump my coffee right into my Aeropress, i don't spoon it. One annoyance is the hopper lid having a bit of a rim: when i push the grinder back again the wall, the lid hits first and often pops off.\nOverall, an excellent grinder with minimal mess."

We went out of town for Thanksgiving and took it with us along with our french press so we could have delicious fresh coffee. For anyone wanting fresh ground coffee this is the grinder for you. We have it set for 12 seconds on the coarsest grind. Packed up our old coffee maker, got more counter space, and now have better coffee than those chain coffee drive thrus."

I owned a Cuisinart electric burr grinder that lasted longer than I anticipated but provided very poor performance... inconsistent grinds, made a huge mess... I was glad when it died. I did quite a bit of research before this purchase and it definitely paid off. The motor is quiet, the process is clean and produces a very consistent grind. My coffee and espresso's are significantly better. I use a French press, stovetop moka and an electric espresso machine. Grind settings are easy to change and I've had excellent results using these brewing devices. I'd recommend this to anybody who wants an affordable, high quality electric burr grinder.\n\nAs a burr grinder alone I'd give it 4 stars, there are certainly better products out there, but the value is superb... this holds its own with $300 grinders and is elegant and highly functional to boot. A very well designed and executed product. Overall, 5 stars."

I use mine primarily for my automatic drip and it seems to work very well for this purpose. At first I was very skeptical; however, there is a HUGE difference in taste between a burr and a blade grinder. This grinder seems to grind the beans very consistently and appropriately for what I use it for. The burrs are some sort of metal (not ceramic), the collection container is glass (less static) and the overall quality of the machine appears to be in-line with its price. However, if you are in the market for a grinder that can handle espresso, I'm not sure this would be a sufficient product. My only 'complaint' is that it will only operate for 20 prior to turning off. Then, as others have mentioned, the manufacturer recommends that you wait 5 minutes prior to operating again. For me, this isn't a big deal because most of the time I am brewing just enough coffee for my wife and I (6-8 cups) and it seems to grind JUST enough."

It is compact and has an attractive non-slip outer skin. It is easy to clean, fully adjustable and delivers a consistent grind. The only drawback is that in order to give it a small foot-print, the motor is small so it can only grind for about 20-40 seconds before it has be allowed to cool. This is a minor quibble and we recommend this to anyone looking for a light-duty burr grinder."

I was even using very gentle taps to loosen up the grounds in the corners. The other issue is if you do happen to break the glass, good luck buying a replacement on Bodums site they are always out of stock. I called Bodum to ask about the stock and was told they would be in stock in a week and its been over a week and they are still out of stock. So I just used some tape to cover the hole in the glass, so far the tap it keeping it all together. I am going to try and find a replacement at a local chemical supply store since the glass is just a beaker they over charge for."

I was replacing an old, inexpensive Cuisinart burr grinder. After many years of daily use and a motor that will run for as long as you need it, I felt like it was becoming a bit dull and thought the Bodum would be a good replacement. Although the Bodum is about the same size, the first thing I noticed was that it is half the weight of the old Cuisinart. I was eager to try it out, so I got out my beans, set the unit for french press and it immediately jammed. Had to remove the cone and the blade, make a big mess then resume. The second attempt produced an inconsistent grind, ranging from big chunks to fine powder. I moved the grind select a bit to the left of french press setting (finer) and it again jammed. Good bye Bodum and thank you Amazon for your effortless return policy."

There is never a mess to clean up and there is no waste AT ALL. Having fresh ground beans every time you brew coffee is a treat.\n\nEdit: Have had the Bodum Bistro for over 5 years now and use it daily. It is still going strong with no problems. We couldn't be happier and wanted to pass along a tip we found for cleaning coffee ground residue at the end of the day. Insert a drinking-straw into the opening where the grounds drop into the receptacle. One or two puffs of air will blow any remaining grounds out of the opening in the top where beans enter the grinder. Its surprising how much collects in there!? Jst be sure to position the unit over (inside) a waste bucket b'cuz it can get messy :) We love this thing."

The grind is quite uniform, and I LOVE the fact that there isn't any of that bitter coffee dust that I got with both of my previous two burr grinders. So why only four stars? A bothersome quirk which has been mentioned elsewhere: the grind time is limited to 20 seconds, with a required 5 minute \"cooling off\" period afterward. Since 90% of the time I use the freshly ground coffee to fortify my favorite canned coffee, this is usually not much of an inconvenience. However, on those occasions when I want to make a full pot with all fresh-ground coffee, it is a bit irksome. Having said that, I would still heartily recommend this grinder for anyone who loves the taste of freshly ground coffee.\nLet me also mention in passing that I received this grinder two days after I bought it, because I used Amazon PRIME. I know this sounds like a commercial, but PRIME saved our sanity this Christmas season."

It does tend to clog up a little, particularly with French roast. I get less coffee through for a given amount of time when I grind French roast. A setting of about 12-13 seconds usually gets me about 20 grams of coffee with non-French roast, about right for my taste. But the timer isn't too precise, particularly if you are running a power hungry appliance on the same circuit - which tends to make the thing run for less time than you set it for. I've learned to wait til the microwave is done heating the water right in my Bodum Brazil French press or in a Bonavita electric kettle before grinding the coffee. (BTW, the microwave method works great, if your French press has no metal. Start with the hottest water that your faucet will deliver. I have a marked line on my French press so I can fill it to the perfect level. You will learn how many minutes and seconds to get a given temperature. I like around 195F, which is 2:10 in my microwave. You won't lose any temperature heating the French press up by heating elsewhere and pouring it in. Then pour in the freshly ground coffee, stir, and wait 4 minutes or so.)\n\nI was using a Bonavita electric kettle to heat the water lately. More precise than the microwave method, but alas the Bonavita failed after less than 3 months (new one on the way under warranty).\n\nI've cleaned it several times by grinding rice.\n\nIf I were really picky I would weigh out the beans and grind them all. The 20 second limit hasn't been a real problem for me because I only had a Mr. Coffee for several months before the thermal fuse blew so back to the French press. When I was grinding for the Mr. Coffee I usually limited my grind to 20 seconds, but several times did two grinds in less than 5 minutes (GASP!) with no adverse effects.\n\nUPDATE - still going after 7 plus years but the throughput is diminished. I can only get about 16 g in 20 seconds. I've tried cleaning, rice, etc. Think maybe the burrs aren't sharp anymore, so will probably buy another."

            "reviewDate": "March 5, 2016",
            "reviewText": "I'm really enjoying my Bodum Bistro after using it for a few weeks. I received the Bodum pour-over carafe for Christmas and after doing some research on economy / home burr grinders I decided to invest in the matching Bistro conical burr grinder.\n\nAssembly was devastatingly simple. After unboxing it, I think I had it up and running in under a minute.\n\nFunctionality is great and simple to use. There's not much to it- an on/off switch, a timer (to control grind \"dosing\"), a secondary 'on' button to initiate grinding, and the grind setting which adjusts by twisting the bean hopper.\n\nThe grind time isn't too fast (which is good. you don't want to heat your beans. slower is better). It takes about 10 or 12 seconds to grind 30-38 grams of beans, which is about 3-4 tablespoons / scoops. Noise level is moderate. Quieter than my blade grinder, but still fairly noisy especially when the hopper is empty and beans aren't being ground. I'd liken it to an air popper or an immersion blender.\n\nGrind consistency is really good, though I'd say the differentiation between grind settings is minute. I find the pour-over setting is too fine and often adjust to be closer to the French-press setting. I don't see why this wouldn't work to make espresso with a pressurized portafilter (might not be fine enough for a bottomless portafilter).\n\nDesign is great, construction is decent; you get what you pay for. The body is rubberized, which I find modern and pleasant. The hopper is plastic, which doesn't bother me any as I don't store my beans in there anyways (always measure / weigh your beans! consistency is important! don't rely on the timer, and please don't store your beans in the hopper. use a light-proof / air-resistant container. i use a ceramic croc). The lid to the hopper is decent and serves its purpose (also rubberized, and a sturdy plastic), but again- I don't store my beans in there anyways and it only serves to prevent beans / fines from flying out when in use.\n\nThe glass catcher- I don't know if it's just mine, but I find fines / chaff still clinging to the surface despite being advertised to reduce static. Not a big deal though- I just give it a sturdy slam on my rubber trivet and swirl the grounds around to remove some of the fines. I guess after thinking about it, it DOES reduce static. I find I use my coffee brush MUCH less than when I was using my blade grinder. Sometimes I find a tiny bit of grounds falling out of the grinder once I remove the catcher (again, no big deal. just brush them into your hand and into your catcher / filter).\n\nOverall I'm very pleased with this product and it's a SIGNIFICANT upgrade from my Hamilton Beach Custom Grind blade grinder. It's a great little grinder for what it is (an introductory home burr grinder). It's not great (and by great I mean industrial / professional grade quality), but if you're thinking about making the jump between blade to burr grinding (or pre-ground to home grinding) this is a great investment. The difference between cups is glaringly apparent and noticeably better. Not as a negative discourse, but the bottom line is the design is more impressive than the functionality / output, so if you're not keen on how it looks you might get a little more out of your grind settings by springing for the Baratza Encore. I love the way it looks and it gets the job done (and does it well)."

To my mounting horror I discovered that my grinder - which had been failing for some time - had expired. I went back to the computer and looked for a replacement grinder. I ordered the new one at about 10:00AM. It got here about twenty minutes ago at 6:00PM - the same day!!!\n\nI had expected it would have taken a couple days for delivery. I figured maybe Tuesday. But it wasn't days, it was hours. This same day delivery cost nothing extra. It was all part of the Prime service. Free.\n\nI got the white version which looks right on my white counters and for some reason cost less to boot. I took it out of the box and set it up. I set the timer to twenty seconds and got twice as much perfectly ground beans as I needed. I have a Starbucks semi-automatic machine with standard 55mm double sized coffee receptacles. I set the grind size at about three steps from the finest.\n\nSo far this is one of the best Amazon buying experiences I've ever had."

Dark or light roasts aren't a problem here, at all...The freshness of the coffee determines how oily the grind will be more than the roast does.

            "reviewText": "I have used this for two days so far and have to say I love the way it is grinding my coffee for my french press. At first I thought that the grind was a little inconsistent with too small of a grind, but it's actually very good. Very little to no silt left at the bottom of my mug. The grinder is pretty quiet. If it's early in the morning on a weekend and the kids are sleeping I might use my hand grinder, but will test this weekend to see if it wakes them, but I don't think it will. The glass receptacle is wonderful as there is no static clean and no mess. It looks like it will be very easy to clean. It took me a few cups to determine how long to set the timer, but for my strongish coffee I have found that 7-8 seconds is perfect. I like how I can fill the hopper and just push the on button and let it go. The only part of the grinder that seems to be cheaply made is the hopper, but if care is taken, I can't see it being broken. It's light, small, attractive. I like the rubberized feel of the unit. It took me a month or so to pull the trigger, but I am glad I did. Also, I was able to order the black one on Amazon for $69.83 and 2 days after I received it, the black one is now $81.68 so that makes it even better. Not sure why, but I notice the silver ($140.19) and gold ($131.34) are much more expensive and can't figure out why. They appear to be the same.\nUPD 02/01/2017 - I have now had the grinder about 3 weeks and still loving it. One thing, though, is that it is louder than I first thought. The first time I tried it with the kids sleeping and early morning, I realized how loud it was. My kids can sleep through smoke detectors so it was no problem, but it's louder than I first reported. Also, I thought that the rubberized exterior would show fingerprints and dirt easily, but it's not too bad either."

You see - when the hot water mixes with an imprecise grind, you get some over-extraction and some under-extraction, which greatly affects the taste of the coffee. Also, the leftover grinds sit in the machine night after night, and bits of them fall out with each fresh batch, also affecting the taste. You'll always get these problems to some degree with any product, but I was surprised just how imprecise the grind is on this product. I guess I just have to spend more to get a quality grinder."

            "reviewText": "Pros -\n\n1. The Ground is very consistent and uniform. I switch between coarse for french press and semi-fine for my drip coffee, and at both settings there has never been any partially ground pieces or the dreaded \"chuncks n' powder\" like some other economy grinders I have owned.\n\n2. The build quality for my unit was high. The machine \"feels\" solid and well made and the grind bin and bean cover fit with a satisfying seal. I owned a black and decker grinder that would spit errant grounds over the counter because the bind just didn't quite fit to the chute. There is NO problem with this as there is a rubber-like top that fits tightly, but not too tightly into the machine.\n\n3. The noise is not bad at all and is better then my previous grinders. I can use it in the morning when I wake up before my gal without waking her up. Perfect.\n\nCons --\n\nAs mentioned by others, there is one flaw to the machine -- as the manual says, you must wait five minutes between grinds so that the burrs can cool down -- as you may recall from high school physics, friction = heat, and so if you don't do this, you will wear out the burr. The problem is that you can grind for a maximum of 20 seconds before the machine needs to rest.\n\nFor me, 20 seconds produces slightly more than one french press or about six cups of drip coffee (I like my coffee somewhat \"fuerte\"). So if you are making several cups, you are going to be waiting to finish the grind. Since I am almost always making coffee for two, this has not been much of a problem, but if you are going to be making large batches, and you don't want to add another five minutes to your grind time, you should invest in a slightly better unit.\n\nBottom line -\n\nThis is your best value at this price point for a burr grinder. It is a great machine and the one that I received was well-made. However, if you are going to be making larger batches of coffee every morning, the maximum that the unit can safely ground at once, may make this a less than attractive option. If that is the case, you should look into other units.\n\nI would buy this again."

Biggest downfall is it can only be run for 20 seconds at a time then wait 5 min for cooldown of motor. so if your needing to grind for several coffees at one time, this grinder is NOT for you. the finest setting is too fine for me, i find it perfect espresso grind on the 3rd to 4th setting over from \"fine\". and in that 20 sec. it will grind enough for 4 shots, or 2 doubles."

The grind I use is well below the coarsest setting and the grind is consistent with very few fines. The ground coffee receptacle is functional and clean. For single grinds up to 8 or 10 cups, the 20 second timer is adequate. But, the 5 minute wait between grinds can be annoying. That is a small price to pay and I work around it without great difficulty. Price to value - I would highly recommend this grinder for home use."

            "reviewText": "Compared to my previous blade griders, this burr grinder is superior in many ways, as probably most burr grinders would be. I've used it for 1 month now for my espresso machine and my drip coffee maker.\n\nGENERAL IMPRESSSIONS: I find it grinds the beans finer compared to the commercially ground coffees I'm used to. For example, the espresso setting produces an extremely fine powder, almost like flour, which is great if that's what you want. Same with the drip filter setting - a finer grind than pre-ground store-bought coffee. The grind is completely adjustable so I just grind the beans a little coarser than the suggested settings and I'm very pleased. For drip coffee I use a reusable metal screen filter, and there is hardly any sediment at the bottom of the pot. I would imagine at the coursest setting the grind would be suitable for use in a french press.\n\nCONCERNS ADDRESSED: I read a lot of reviews before I purchased this, so I'd like to address come concerns and criticisms other people mentioned:\n\nGRINDING TIME LIMITATION: After 20 seconds of use you're supposed to let the machine cool down for 5 minutes before running it again. How much coffee can be ground in 20 seconds? At the espresso setting it takes about 17 seconds to grind enough for a double-shot of espresso which is all my espresso maker can handle at one time. At the drip filter setting 20 seconds grinds enough for 10 strongish cups of coffee (individual tastes will vary). I've made 12 cup pots with only 20 seconds of grinding and it was okay. You're probably not going to kill the machine if, once a month, after grinding for 20 seconds, you immediately turn it on for an extra 5 seconds. The non-english instructions do state it can run for 40 seconds straight, however the voltage is different in Europe and for all I know some of the components are different for the European models which allow them to run longer. If you often brew large pots of coffee your options are to train yourself to grind a little ahead of time using this Bodum grinder, risk burning out the motor by running it for more than 20 seconds every 5 minutes, or buy another grinder that can grind larger amounts.\n\nINCONSITENT GRIND - I'll admit, I was expecting the grind to be as consistent as commercially purchased pre-ground coffee. It is not. There are very small amounts of fine powder mixed in with the courser grinds, but overall it is not a problem for me. The grind is much more consistent compared to my old blade grinders!!!\n\nNOISE - This grinder is more quiet than blade grinders. It is solidly built and probably muffles noise as much as possible - which also probably prevents heat dissipation, hence the cool-down time between uses.\n\nMESS (OR LACK THEREOF) - Bodum did an excellent job designing this grinder. No issues with static whatsoever. The flexible lid of the glass cup creates a seal with the grinder, ensuring grounds only go into the cup and not all over the place. Inevitably there will be grounds stuck up in the burrs when the machine shuts off, so if you don't give the machine a little tap before pulling the grounds cup out, some grounds may fall out inadvertantly. I see this as a consequence of using a burr grinder, and not this specific model.\n\nOverall, I am very satisfied with this grinder and I would recommend it to friends and family."

In this area I've found that the '20 seconds' is fine for a 6 - 8 cup drip or 2 double espressos. As there are only two of us that drink coffee in the house, this is quite adequate. The grinder itself is much quieter than its predecessor in my kitchen, is adjustable to my desired grinding levels, and gets the job done for both drip and espressos. No heat on the beans, consistency in the grind, and quite a nice looking unit make me quite pleased with my purchase. Recommend to everyone, perhaps excluding the 1%."

The first was purchased about 6 years ago and now has stopped grinding consistently--no matter how close to fine I set it, it just makes something with an inconsistent grind. The second was purchased about 10 months ago and is doing fine, but seems slightly noisier than the older one.\n\nI've used it inconsistently, from once or twice a week to multiple times per day.

            "reviewText": "We find that this burr grinder is far superior to the \"millstone types\" on the market, which we have had in the past, both in quietness and grinding speed. Though we may tend to like our coffee a bit stronger than most, we find that the longest setting on the timer - 20 seconds - is not quite long enough for a 12 cup brew. We find ourselves running a 20 second cycle, followed by a 5 second one. This pretty much fills the catch container \"brim full\". An effort to run it longer will guarantee a mess. As others have noted, it is best to invert the catch container with the lid on it (holding it on) over the coffeemaker basket and tap lightly on the bottom. Removing the lid will unavoidably cause a counter clean-up because of the coffee clinging to the lid from static electricity. We particularly like the large bean reservoir, giving us multiple days of coffee with one fill. The easy setting for the texture of the grind is appreciated, and once adjusted to your liking, may never need to be adjusted again. This is an excellent grinder, which we happily recommend."

Almost every review goes on and on about the timer being limited to 20 seconds and the fact that you have to wait 5 minutes before grinding again. In reality this is just an overly cautious note by the manufacturer, the reality is that they dont want you grinding for too long all at once.. 20 seconds is enough to grind most amounts anyway. If you need a little more, then grind a little more. I use a Bonjour Smart Brewer (1 or 2 cup) drip maker. I set the grinder for about 5 seconds and press the button once and i get the perfect amount of grinds that i can just dump in the coffee maker. It streamlines the process and avoids the problem of grinding too much or too little. Love it."

It looks like the circuit board failed because I traced the power to that and then nothing. It uses a small micro switch and those typically are reliable so it's probably a burned out transistor or diode. What a shame a $120 unit is rendered inoperable (and non repairable) by a 20 cent component, this is a major design flaw."

Turns out the glass on the bottom is eggshell-thin (maybe thinner). This wasn't abuse IMHO, I was just scooping out coffee as anyone would do. Not sure if the catcher was defective or cracked but I suspect it was because the glass is needlessly thin. To make matters worse, it took a month to get a replacement catcher from Bodum due to the product being out of stock (we bought two just to have one in reserve). So, in summary, great grinder but be very gentle with the catcher."

Each successive cup has yielded the same emotion. I paid $80 for the grinder and I am delighted with the results. We didn't change anything else. She absolutely loves her morning coffee. Personally,I don't drink coffee but I love the smile on her face when she sips her coffee now."

I've been trying to get into grinding my own coffee beans and brewing my own coffee instead of going out to a cafe.\n\nIt's a wise choice. This grinder gets the job done with no hassles. It's not loud, it adjusts how fine or coarse you want your grind, and it's rather easy to clean. Now, I get to enjoy better coffee for lower prices, and can choose what beans I'd like. For the price of the griner and beans? It's well worth it."

Reviews led me to the Bodum Bistro, so now I'll share my thoughts as well.\n\nI make coffee one cup at a time using a Melitta cone filter basket that sits on top of my coffee mug. If you have thus far avoided the hype that is single-cup coffee brewing machines, take the money you've saved and get yourself a one-cup filter and this grinder instead. A few experimental runs led me to the coarseness (just finer than drip) and time (7 seconds) required to grind exactly as much coffee as I need for a single cup. Now I leave the settings as they are and only have to push a button in the morning. I find that a pound of coffee lasts me longer now than it did when I was using the old Krups.\n\nIn a nutshell:\n\nPros:\n- Even grind with less dust and sediment around the work area\n- Acts as coffee bean storage\n- Makes more efficient use of the beans\n- Identical results every time\n- Glass catcher and plastic lid keep grounds under control\n- Small footprint and attractive design\n\nCons:\n- Stays on the counter all the time\n- Hopper doesn't quite hold a full pound of coffee\n- Settings are awkward to change if you need to change them often\n- Relatively small capacity per grind\n- Rubberized exterior requires frequent cleaning - collects dust from the kitchen (flour, etc.)\n\nIf you make a full pot in a 12-cup drip machine every morning, this probably isn't the burr grinder for you. However, if you're a French press or one-cup drinker, I haven't seen a better grinder on the market to meet your needs."

My coffee maker makes 12 cups; the grinder does not grind enough to make a decent 10-cup pot, much less a 12-cup pot. Why not just immediately grind another batch? The instructions clearly state that one should wait at least five minutes between grindings. Well, that won't do. So, I end up grinding beans the night before so that I can add to the batch that I grind in the morning. Well, that defeats the purpose of having a coffee grinder so as to have freshly-ground beans. This is a real issue with me. I would not buy this product again."

It started to struggle to grind at the finer settings and finally would not grind at those settings at all. Also, the on /off switch shorted, so the grinder turned on as soon as power was turned on. I contacted the company directly on their website and, after voicing my complaint and providing my receipt from Amazon, they sent me a brand new one with no questions asked, keeping true to their 2-year warranty policy! Customer service was prompt, efficient and helpful. Maybe not a fail-safe product, but definitely an excellent company! The working grinder is also quite excellent, I find."

I have not had another grinder like this so I have no products really to compare it with.

It is much more quiet than my blade grinder, and with the glass container the coffee grinds fall into, it makes grinder to coffee maker transfer simple. My cups of coffee actually taste much better with the consistent control of the ground consistency used in my Bunn coffee maker... Overall very happy with my purchase!"

The return period has passed but a coffee grinder that costs that much should work for YEARS, not months. The good news is that I contacted Bodum and they responded they will replace the product as it has a two year warranty. Their response was quite timely, so, I'm still sad that it failed after 5 months, but pleased with Bodum's response."

No Espresso grinds tried yet. Best bang for the buck ($73 with shipping to the door)."

I called their support number and it went straight to a representative, no waiting on hold or navigating any prompts. I explained what was going on and he asked that I email their sales team my receipt. The next day I received a reply that they would Fedex me a new grinder, no questions asked.

I doubt any other electric grinder would have really been better though, so I don't hold this against this one. Very sturdy. I think that I will have this around for a long time.\n\nIn the end of the day I wound up getting a little hand grinder and I wind up using that 90% of the time. It is quieter and I've also found that the hand grinder results in better espresso. A little more crema and better taste for whatever reason.\n\nSo... Functional, sturdy, attractive grinder that won't break the bank. I'm knocking off a star because I wind up using my hand grinder instead (which I will be rating with 5 stars because it is awesome)"

Withholds quite a bit of ground coffee up inside (which wastes good coffee beans) and then the excess grinds spill out all over your counter when you least expect it. We've used it for 8 days now and it's jammed up at least a dozen times already, requiring that we take it apart, clean it and put it back together. On top of everything else, it's impossible to get an appropriately coarse grind for pressed coffee. We had a Baratza before this and loved it, so we're getting another one of those instead."

Also we use a fine grind during the week for our drip coffee maker and the fine coffee plugs up the unit which is then very difficult to clean. It is very odd as you have to take the top part off and find something to stick up the hole to get the coffee out which will not damage the mechanism. I use a bamboo skewer but it doesn't seem very intuitive, I'm thinking there must be some better systems out there for the money."

            "reviewText": "My last two coffee grinders have been the Cuisinart units which usually last about two years before dying. The Bodium grinder is a far better unit. First the burr looks very substantial and is nicely made. The burr setup is set into a delrin type of plastic which is very tough stuff. The burr set disassembles easily for cleaning There are many nice features designed into this unit, most impressive is the glass collection jar (much less static cling) and rock clutch which slips the grind mechanism if a rock get in with the beans. The grind path is all downhill so I think this unit will clog less. I would say it is very well thought out from a design standpoint. The grind quality is the best I have seen in a relatively inexpensive grinder. We are using about 20% less coffee and the coffee taste is better which I can only attribute to the better grind. The Cuisinart sounded like and was almost as loud as a wood chipper, this unit is much more quiet. We used to run the Cuisinart for over 40 seconds to get enough coffee for our Newco (one of the best drip coffee units by far due to the superior, HOT, commercial grade heater), after experimentation we run the Bodium for 30 seconds. This brings us to the reason I rated this unit four stars, the timer only goes to 20 seconds max. and it is recommended to wait another 20 minutes before grinding more coffee due to motor heat issues. BULL to that, I will be the $75.00 beta tester on that BS rule. We run the machine first thing for 15 seconds, go through the usual coffee brewing preparations and then do the second 15 second grind. I do not think this will be a problem. It seems a little strange that they would design this grinder so that it would not grind enough for a standard drip coffee maker in one shot but all in all this is a very nice unit and I expect it will outlast the Cuisinart. Most of all if you are using a \"spice grinder\" type of coffee grinder treat yourself to a proper grinder and a good drip, press or extraction brewing system and enjoy the health and \"wake up\" benefits of a great cup of joe."

            "reviewText": "Update (late August 2016): After a few frustrating weeks, Bodum sent a replacement unit that (upon initial testing) doesn't seem to have the same problem and works great. Assuming that it keeps working (and I'll update this review if it doesn't), this is a fantastic grinder that easily deserves five stars. And while Bodum's support isn't perfect, it's pretty darn good.\n\nZero stars for poor quality and lack of product support from Bodum.\n\nPurchased in mid-2016 to replace an identical unit bought in 2012 that worked beautifully until a stone destroyed the burr. The old one was really great. The new grinder, however, has a habit of stopping after 20 seconds and not starting again unless it is completely disassembled and the grinder wheel is manually rotated (usually with the handle end of a teaspoon). This usually involves dumping out a hopper full of beans and getting ground coffee everywhere. I suspect there's some kind of jam sensor that can't distinguish between beans and an actual jam (and there's no override - cycling power does nothing).\n\nFrom the other reviews it seems like I just got a bad unit, so I called Bodum. A nice lady took my information, gave me a case number, asked me to email them confirmation of my purchase (which I did), and said someone would contact me. Nobody contacted me. After a few days I called back to get an update. They said that the \"head office\" had my request and that someone would contact me. Still no contact.\n\nSadly, Amazon only accepts returns within 30 days (and I didn't act on the problem until just after 30 days passed). Buyer beware. If you purchase be sure to test thoroughly and get any returns to Amazon within 30 days. Bodum support is pathetic."

            "reviewText": "I bought the Bodum Bistro 15 months ago and have used it to make 6 or 8 individual cups of coffee every day since. For that period I would give it a five-star rating. I experimented to find out that I preferred the grind that is one step from the finest grind setting; it produces a consistent size. The ground coffee drops into the glass holder whose rubber top keeps fine coffee from getting all over the countertop, so it's a very clean machine to use. I have periodically lifted out the conical burr and vacuumed to clean it. Within the past week I noticed that the coffee it was grinding was weak, and I saw that the ground beans were inconsistent in size and larger than the fine setting that I have dialed in. Cleaning it made no difference. Being 3 months over the one-year warranty period, I would now give it one star, and I am looking at reviews for coffee grinders. If you are interested in the Bodum Bistro, be sure to pay a little extra to get the two year extension to its warranty.\n\nSubsequent to the original review, this grinder started freezing up and making a racket - which the instruction booklet said would happen if a small pebble got in with the beans. I checked my beans and there were no signs of any foreign material. So, when the grinder started freezing up several more times, I ordered another. Lo and behold, the same things happened several times with the new one. So, I returned the 'replacement' and am shopping for a better performing conical burr grinder that the Bodum Bistro."

            "reviewText": "I am a coffee professional and I just purchased this item. My coffee shop sells Baratza grinders but I wanted to try Bodum partially because another shop in town sells them and I saw some good reviews about grind consistency. Specifically I saw someone compare the grind consistency of this grinder vs a Baratza and say it was better.\n\nI wish I had read more reviews.\n\nThe ring burr sits in there loosely. This troubled me as soon as I saw it but it seems to sit in place nicely once the hopper is on so I decided not to worry about it. It is most definitely a problem. On top of this the electric motor isn't powerful enough to chew through beans that might get jammed and that's because some of the plastic gears inside can break if they're forced to take too much torque. This grinder jammed on me TWICE the next morning after setting it up. Light roasted coffee is a bit tougher to grind than dark roast but I got it from Kickapoo so I know it's fully developed. I fixed the first jam and hoped it was just a fluke -- you can get a bean going in at just the wrong angle, etc, I was giving it the benefit of the doubt. As soon as I cleared it, cleaned it, and set it back up... it jammed again. I stopped it and did some research. With it trying to move I opened the grind size up and then went finer and this broke up the jam without having to turn it off and clear the hopper. This was still EXTREMELY bothersome, and certainly doesn't help grind consistency.\n\nPoor quality parts, poor quality design, poor quality grinder. Even the glass grind catcher holds a lot of grinds to static so I have no idea what they're talking about. I feel like this grinder is completely opposite to every single review I've read. I'm extremely disappointed in my purchase and my morning coffee is definitely ruined. Not a good day, Bodum. You know how people get when their morning brew is ruined.\n\nI'll update this review if anything changes. I'm likely going to be returning it and getting a better grinder like I should have in the first place."

            "reviewText": "I just received mine today. I promise I'll come back and change the stars if I change my opinion over time. Reading reviews of this grinder while shopping, I had a few unanswered questions.\n\nHow much coffee can one grind in 20 seconds? Just before my last grinder shuddered and died, I weighed the coffee it was grinding since I was satisfied with the portion. It was 50 grams. Today, I measured 50 grams of beans, and they finished grinding before the 20 seconds was up. This was enough coffee to brew a nice strong pot in my Bodum French Press which handles around 1.3 liters of water.\n\nIs it really too fine a grind? Still don't really know how to judge what too fine a grind is, but I can tell you what the bottom of the cup looked like when the coffee was gone. My dead grinder was a Melitta, cheap, messy, but consistent. The coarsest part of the grind was coarser than what my new Bodum produced today. But at the end of the cup there was a pretty heavy dark sediment left. Today, I could look at the bottom of the cup, and tell that there had been coffee in it, but it was just a little dust. Much less muddy coffee. I was impressed.\n\nHow messy is it? Compared to my Melitta, not messy at all. There was a little dust which clung to the glass. I just moistened a tissue and wiped under where the glass container comes out, and got no dust. At this point I'm very satisfied. But I can't give five stars on the first day. (I was about to write that if you check the all my reviews link you will find this is the only one. I was surprised to find three, which I recognize must have been written by my son while he was between 12 and 14 years old. Who knew?)"

Grinding for 20 seconds on the drip setting does not produce enough grinds for 2 mugs. Admittedly, like my coffee on the strong side. Just don't feel like grinding another 5 seconds right away, and pushing what may be the limits of this motor. And if I'm serving more than myself, waiting the 5 minutes between grinding is going to annoy me (or whoever I'd put in charge of grinding!) Paying the extra hundred bucks for the Breville."

I like a dark roast, so wanted to pick a grinder that could handle the type of coffee I like without clogging or being a pain to use. I use my grinder for the first time, ground up about half a bag (I am lazy & not functional in the a.m. so try to grind up enough for the week at one time) and definitely noticed a big difference in my coffee: tast, flavor & aroma! No more of a mess than using my old blade grinder; easier to use, maybe a little more work to clean but not a big deal Seems to be very good value for price.."

The burr grinder produces a more consistent grind and (unlike blade grinders) is well-suited for doing the espresso grind needed by our Aeropress.\n\nThe only time I've had a problem with this Bodum grinder is when a roommate attemped to grind a pound of lightly roasted beans all at once on the finest setting. This led to an accumulation of grounds around the moving parts and in the chute to the collection box. It took a bit of effort to clean out the \"impacted\" grounds, after which the grinder has been perfectly functional."

The grind is very consistent and there is enough grinding time to handle a strong pot of 12/6oz cups. The glass container with rubber fittings is a big plus over the plastic messy container of the last grinder. Very satisfied with this product. If it lasts as long as the last Bodum grinder, I will enjoy fresh ground coffee for years."

I do like the glass canister that catches the grounds, it greatly reduces the amount of coffee that sticks to the sides compared to plastic canisters. I got this product over others because I knew Bodum is a reputable brand, and it was less expensive than the others I was looking at. I only wish the canister for beans felt a little more sturdy on the grinder, and that the lit closed more securely. The lid never quite feels like it's on to me, and seems flimsy. But as I don't store my beans there, it's not a major issue for me. I pour any leftover beans back into a Friis coffee canister after grinding to preserve freshness."

I have no idea what went wrong but it doesn't work anymore.

A little over a month after purchasing the grinder the motor failed. Things happen, all manufactured items have a small percentage of lemons, that's fine. I assume the 1 year warranty would take care of the situation as it was outside of the 1 month return window from amazon. I contacted the manufacturer and they said THE WARRANTY IS ONLY FOR PRODUCTS PURCHASED THROUGH THEIR ONLINE STORE. THEY DO NOT SUPPORT SALES THROUGH THIRD PARTY SITES INCLUDING AMAZON. Do not buy this product as it has a high failure rate, look at the 1 and 2 star reviews, I knew this when I purchased but rolled the dice. When it fails you are out of luck. They did offer me a 20% off coupon but I will avoid Bodum and suggest you do the same."

            "reviewDate": "March 10, 2012",
            "reviewText": "I spent quite a bit of time before deciding on the bodum bistro grinder. There were so many positive reviews. I knew the limitations of the unit since it was sub $100. I was fine with these limitations since I only planned to make drip and press pot coffee with beans that I roast at home. The biggest selling point for me was the glass receptacle to prevent statically charged grinds.\n\nI got my unit and couldn't be more disappointed. I almost think the unit simply has to be defective since it is so bad (based upon the glowing reviews other have given). Here are my complaints:\n\n* The grind on the drip setting was much too fine. Unfortunately, using a coarser grind seemed to make no difference. The grind was a powder like consistency.\n\n* The glass container had lots of statically charged fines stuck to it after each grind. This was disappointing since a large selling point was the anti-static technology and the glass container.\n\n* A significant amount of coffee was left above the glass receptacle after grinding. I had to hit the unit with my hand to make it drop into the container.\n\n* The coarse setting for press produced inconsistently sized grinds that had some chunks mixed in with very fine particles.\n\n* The 20 second grind time before waiting 5 minutes (that other reviewers complain about). I knew this going in and could have tolerated it had the other problems not existed.\n\nI sent it back for a refund today. I thought about exchanging it but many other reviewers complained that it grinds too fine for a french press. As such, I felt like even if the other problems were corrected with an exchange, I might still be disappointed.\n\nInstead, I have purchased Cuisinart DBM-8 for $50. I fully understand that these are all budget, entry-level grinders that are meant to be a step up from a blade grinder (and have limitations when compared to superior, more expensive grinders). Hopefully, this new one will turn out better. As far now, I am enjoying far better coffee with my blade grinder while I wait for my new burr mill grinder to arrive."

I mainly make coffee in a stovetop percolator, which calls for a fairly fine grind. The first time I used this grinder, I tried grinding less than half a cup of coffee on the next-to-finest grind, and gave up after running the machine 5 times and still having half the coffee unground. I swapped to a much coarser setting and it ground the coffee much faster. It seems like even the coarsest setting is finer than what my old blade grinder could manage and I'm fine with using a coarser grind for my percolator, but anyone who wants to grind coffee for espresso should get a different machine."

As I was checking it out, I pressed the On button and one side of the button caught on the housing, then broke off inside the machine rendering the machine unusable. Great...$100 for a coffee grinder that lasted 2 months. POOR quality!!\n\nI assumed I could return the product BUT based on the return policy for a product I have owned for ONLY 2 MONTHS (a) only a partial refund is available, and (b) I'm required to pay shipping to return the busted piece of junk. No thanks."

I cleared these out and gave the entire grinder a good cleaning, and guess what, it works like new. So, if your grinder begins not running for the allotted amount of time, give it a good cleaning."

            "reviewDate": "December 26, 2015",
            "reviewText": "I have owned this product for 2 days now and it looks like a solid piece of equipment. I have ground coffee for both French Press and Espresso (used in Aeropress), so both sides of the spectrum and the grind size seems to be accurate and consistent. The burr grinder is made of solid metal and not plastic and the grounds jar is glass.\n\nMy real problem is the manual says not to run the grinder more than the maximum time of 20 seconds, without letting the grinder rest 5 minutes.\n\nHaving read the reviews of this complaint and those dismissing it I decided to take a chance and purchase this. What I think the reviews lacked when talking about this shortcoming is actual examples of what it can grind in that 20 seconds.\n\nOn the finest setting with 2 scoops of beans and the timer set to its max of 20 seconds, the grinder only ground 3/4 of those 2 scoops. So you have to wait 5 minutes to finish off the rest of the 2 scoops. On the maximum grind size setting with 4 scoops of coffee beans, it will just barely finish the grind, but there will be a few unground beans left in the burrs. So what does this mean for those that use a drip coffee setup? On the medium grind setting, it will not finish 4 scoops of coffee used to make 8 cups. So me personally, I will ignore the manufacture warning and simple start the grind process again to finish. When it breaks I will throw it away and buy something else.\n\nLastly this thing is messy, there is always grounds left in the grinding chamber and you have to literally smack the grinder on the side quite a few times to clear it out before removing the jar. Even then grounds spill out all over the place. Having not owned an electric burr grinder before, I could not say if this is normal or not.\n\nSo while I really like the grinder design, build quality and consistent grind, it fails to do what it needs to do for me, which is grind a reasonable amount of coffee in a reasonable amount of time.\n\n***EDIT*** Grinder Makes the Coffee Burnt Tasting\nI purchased this grinder along with a French press as I had been using drip and an Aeropress along with a Cozyna Ceramic Burr Manual Coffee Grinder. Using the manual grinder, Aeropress and my own roasted beans, I made the most delicious cup of coffee. For the water I would use the drip coffee maker which put out water between 168 ~ 170 deg.\nI found that the coffee has tasted bitter and burnt since using the new grinder. I had been using the same beans freshly ground and to the same grind size as the manual. I was using a new variable temp kettle and tried the coffee @ 170, 195 and 205 deg with still the same results. The beans that I use made a very distinctly buttery smell when ground. Testing side by side the grinds out of the Bodum smelled burnt. I then tested the same coffee from my manual grinder and the Bodum in the Aeropress using water temp of 170 deg. The coffee out of the manual grinder / Aeropress tasted as it always has, fantastic. The coffee out of the Bodum tasted bitter and burnt. I am not sure why it tasted different, the only thing I can see being different is that the burrs on the Bodum are sharp steel and still blade like, using speed to grind the bean as much as its burrs, whereas the manual grinder are ceramic and dull using pressure to grind at a much slower RPM."

I turned on the power, the power light went on, then nothing. I re-read the instructions -- no help. I tried all the different settings, to no avail. I removed the beaker that receives the ground coffee and re-installed it -- several times. Nothing. Pushed the standby button several times and this caused the grinder to actually grind a few beans. However, I was not able to repeat the experience and the machine is now totally dead.\n\nIt's going back. I'd give it no stars or minus stars if I could.\n\nWill try a replacement.

The conical burr grinder really does make the best espresso. However, after about 2 weeks it locked up and stopped working, the grinder motor would not rotate when full assembled. I've had espresso grinders break in the past but not after 2 months, that was just ridiculous! While this makes some of the best espresso grinds it's not worth the money for how often you would have to replace it, try a comparable burr grinder that at least will last 2 years."

            "reviewText": "My wife and I are coffee drinkers, but I'll say the price on this coffee grinder scared me. Nonetheless, with all of the positive reviews I saw on this product and the fact that we got 3-years out of our last coffee grinder, a Capresso (which was half the price), I thought I'd bite the bullet and get it. I'll say I was blown away at first by how fine it could grind the beans. Great for cappuccinos and coffee in general, leading to some of the best coffee we've ever drunk. Now, as I said, my wife and I really like our coffee and so it initially seemed well worth it. We have really busy lives though, with us being at the office or working from home 12-14 hours a day, so I like to try to grind about a week's worth during the weekend. In less than 2-weeks worth of usage, it had stopped grinding beans altogether, with it just now emitting a sickly whirring noise. Very disappointing, especially having spent $80 on it. The Capresso I had used, again, lasted 3-years under the same level of usage. Is this grinder only suppose to be used for one serving on a daily basis? I wrote to Bodum over a week ago and received no response whatsoever though there was an automatice message after sending it saying that they would get back to me within a few days. Thank God, Amazon has a great return/exchange policy. I am hoping that this one was just a lemon and that exchanging it will solve the problem, but until then, I am leaving this review up for the Bodum Bistro Electric Burr Coffee Grinder. To those of you where it lasted more than two weeks, I am envious, because it resulted in a fine coffee WHEN IT WORKED.\n\nTwo lemons in a row. I know this one has its fans, but I simply cannot recommend."

The 20-seconds per five-minutes was irritating. And the inability to smoothly and neatly return unground beans to another container. Then the well documented (in these reviews) inconsistency of the grind, compensated for by adjusting the ring. Seems the noise of the beast will always be headache-producing. I stepped out of the room for those 15 seconds. Until it stopped grinding because of the broken gears. Then it just thunked instead of screamed.\n\nOh, did I mention how hard it is to clean grinds out of the grinding shoot? A flexible straw, a brush that's narrow and flexes, a bowl (to contain the mess), a towel, a damp sponge and a sturdy 'thump' on the side are needed to clean this grinder. Who knew.\n\nLooks pretty. It's got that going for it. Bodum seems to have one person in Customer Service. No notice that the grinder was received. No note that a new one had shipped. Nothing at all, really, but an address to ship it to - along with the the email docoumentation which had transpired over the interveining weeks. Working with Bodum is akin to swimming through half-set Jello. A slow process. Today the second grinder, which I returned following the exact instructions of Geudy Polanco at Bodum, was returned to me. BODUM REFUSED DELIVERY - after telling me to return it. Go figure.

And this was at the coarsest setting as I use a French press. I use dark roasted beans which I know can be harder and oilier than lightly roasted ones. I tried multiple ways to correct the problem with no improvement. I read another reviewer had a similar problem. Basically I set the timer for 15 seconds and it would grind from 1 to 5 seconds before stopping. Sometimes pressing the start button would do nothing and YES the power button was set to ON. It also produced a lot of small grinds and static caused them to stick to the slides of the container. Also note the manufacturer says that you should wait 5 minutes for each 20 second cycle. 5 minutes? Come on. On the positive side, the unit is attractive...while it lasted. It is now being returned to Amazon while I seek other options to address my daily coffee needs. So if you use dark beans consider looking elsewhere. I wish the product description mentioned that little fact."

I did this several times on the 20 second setting and the machine ran fine each time but only a tiny bit of beans came out. After removing the container and examining the grinding wheel, it looks like the beans are just clogging up and sticking to the wheel and in between the blades. They are not shooting into the cup. I'm using Starbucks Espresso beans which I know are a bit oily but still this $130 grinder should be able to handle this on its espresso setting. Maybe something's faulty with the unit or the way I'm working it but I really don't think so. I'm going to return this and select another brand/style. Grinding Starbucks beans should not be a problem."

The plastic used for this product is so full of static, that with every grind there is a powdery mess. It does not matter that everything is very tightly fit together, a powdery residue finds it's way out. The grinder, does an excellent job of grinding, but this is offset by the mess, timer issue is a non-issue for us. Even the glass receptacle that catches the coffee has a serious static problem, go figure. Clearly some reviews on this product are deceptive. I based my purchase on the reviews I read and was pretty upset to see how they misled. We'll use it until we can find a replacement. I rarely comment on a product purchase but I had to speak up, to offset the reviews that were not honest.\n\n01/19/2013: Update: Figured out how to deal with the static problem. If when you grind you hold the glass receptacle up against the discharge there is very little leakage of coffee grounds. If you grind the coffee the night before you intend to use it, the static is discharged before you empty the glass container and the coffee goes where you want without a static caused mess. I've added a star and am now happy with this product."

My major problems with the Bodum Bistro Burr Grinder are as follows in order of significance.\n\n1) Its very messy. While grinds do go into the nice glass container when grinding, this doesn't prevent them from falling out of the grinder when you remove the container from grinder. It doesn't tell you anywhere in the site or manual, but the way grinds get into the little glass container is by their being pushed by the grinding wheel into an opening above the glass container. When you remove the container, there is a still a pile of grinds, at the opening ready to fall onto the base at the slightest jolt. You end up with grounds on the counter. You can try to tip the unit forward but that doesn't seem to work too well. Doing a periodic cleaning is even messier. There is no way to close off the hopper unit, so if it jams (as ours did once), you have to empty the hopper which is also messy.\n\n2) While static is minimized, when you go to put the ground coffee into a plastic coffee maker (e.g. a Cuisinart DCC-1200), there is still a static attraction and the grounds scatter all over the top of the unit (which if you have it open as one normally would when putting coffee into the maker) results in coffee grinds getting into the water compartment. I now take the coffee basket out of the maker, set it in a canister to stay upright and put the grinds in there. Hardly convenient.\n\n3) The hopper lid does not appear to be really air-tight and hence not a great place to store beans before grinding.\n\n4) While quieter than a krups coffee grinder, it really isn't that quiet and it takes a lot longer (two pushes of 20 seconds each) to grind enough beans for 12 cups of coffee. So the resulting noise invasion is longer and ultimately more obtrusive.\n\nBottom line, it may be great if you only grind a few cups worth of beans for a french press or similar device. Strictly overrated for use with conventional drip maker.\n\nUpdate as of 12/13/2011.\n\nHave been using the grinder for about 8 months now, unfortunately, I still find the grinder to be messy. The tapping technique helps a bit, but don't expect to be able to grind coffee without having to wipe at least some coffee grounds off the counter. I am still surprised that static isn't a problem for more people. I live near the beach (1.5 miles) so its not like I live in a dry desert area. Standing by my two star review because of the mess.\n\nFinal Update 7/29/2013\n\nMy unloved Bodum grinder gave up the ghost today. The motor now spins but the grinder no longer grinds. Looked briefly for spare parts on the Internet, but didn't find much. Can't say that I will miss it. The unit got louder and louder over time, so much so that I was surprised how much quieter my old blade grinder was then the Boudum. All in all one of the worst appliance purchases I have made."

            "reviewDate": "November 17, 2018",
            "reviewText": "I bought BODUM BISTRO with \"CONTINUOUSLY ADJUSTING GRIND\" eleven months ago and have been using that daily and am comparing this BODUM BISTRO 11750 which costs half as much, which I was offered to review. I will compare and contrast the two, I feel the price is a major decision point for me, as is mess and cleanup, so after using both side by side I would choose this BODUM BISTRO 11750 if given the choice between the two.\n\nTop considerations for me: consistent grind size, mess or lack of making a mess, and price. Lowest price for best performance is my choice. Least amount of mess is preferred.\n\nMy most common coffee making style is french press with coarse ground but I did test with fine ground also.\n\nComparisons:\nGRIND CONSISTENCY: The CONTINUOUSLY ADJUSTABLE GRIND does an action where the burrs move and adjust themselves in order to attempt to make a consistent grind size. I applaud this effort. In side by side comparisons of grind size consistency on coarse setting, I found the 11750 was just a little worse with occasional larger pieces and some fine grounds when I had set it to the coarse setting. This is because it appears that the 11750 does NOT have a constantly adjustable burr grinding action. I am questioning how necessary that action is and if it justifies spending double. Note when testing FINE GROUNDS the consistency was great, which honestly is more important when making espresso drinks.\n\nTHE MESS: One reason I purchased the \"Continuously Adjusting Grind\" was it supposedly had a lower static cling factor for the glass and it has a rim of silicone that is supposed to prevent spills. However this is not the case, it does make a mess, when removing the glass container the grounds are on the machine, under the glass, and already on the counter. When pouring it out it spills, I do this over the sink and pour into a large mouth jar and measure out from there. The max size of the machine does not fill my large capacity french press so the feature where you choose the amount of grinds to make and get exactly that with one press of the start button is not useful to me. I always must have more than one full container so I wind up with leftovers I use the next day. The 11750 has NO MESS at all and it has a plastic tightly fitting shaped container so you get a larger portion of grinds. The sharp edges of the 11750 allow a clean and static-free pour with no spilling.\n\nCost: The 11750 is half the price of the \"continuously adjusting grind\" model.\n\nOther notes: The 11750 is a bit more basic. You must press start and you must press the same button for stop. It does not automatically stop when the container is full. The button itself is a bit mushy and you have to press hard and directly down the center of the button for it to work. For the value on price I can deal with this! The more expensive one has a nicer start button and that one shuts off automatically when it hits the capacity you set the dial to. Is this worth double the price? I don't think so.\n\nTo change the grind size on the 11750 you twist the clear coffee bean holder at the top rather than trying to force the red dial for size. You can select any size in between fine, medium and coarse by stopping along the large dial.\n\nThe 11750 has a clear lid and the other has a black lid.\n\nInstruction manual: Oddly the 11750 has a diagram of parts which is missing the removable burr (!) so I figured out assembly with my own common sense, and it has an extra part for the bean holder listed that I don't have. Also the manual is frustrating as it has pages and pages of legal language but no instructions on how to use the controls. There is not enough descriptive information about using the grind setting. I was unable to shift the grind size when there were beans in it and it kind of fell apart and the beans went all over the place. That should have been mentioned in the directions, to empty all whole beans before changing the size of the grind! The manual is in 11 languages and is over 75 pages long because of that and the legal warnings.\n\nI rate this 4 stars = Like It although if rating against value for the price compared to the other model that's double the price I may say 4.5 stars."

I expected only a year's worth of use out of it, so I put it aside and pulled out the New-Old-Stock. Plugged it in, did a test run: Nothing. I'm an electrical engineer, so I knew this thing wasn't complicated. I pulled them apart.\n\nThere is a cheap contact switch at the top that I had to override to get them to work (brown and red wires).

The motor started smoking and I had to take the thing apart twice just to get enough ground coffee to use in a french press. I returned it promptly. Horrible product.\n\nSo then I purchased this Bodum grinder. Having a glass grind receptacle was mandatory and there aren't many grinders on the market (for home use anyway) that have them. So I was hopeful that the Bodum grinder would perform better. And it did. The grind is consistent (I've only used the course grind for the french press) and the glass jar means no static and flying grounds so cleanup is easy. It's relatively quiet and less than half the price of the Kitchenaid unit. I haven't used this grinder long term, but based on my experience so far I'd rate it as a great buy. I'll never grind on its finest setting (espresso) so I can't comment on the grinding experience for that. I use very oily beans (french roast) and the grinder has no problem avoiding clogs.\n\nUPDATE: I've been using this for a couple of weeks now and my earlier review stands. I have since tried grinding for a drip coffee maker and that finer grind is also consistent. Clean up with this grinder is very easy. The burr grinder pops right out. And you can tilt it over the sink and tap the built up grounds out."

            "reviewText": "I was previous using a Cuisinart DBM-8 grinder. One of the main differences in functionality between it and this Bodum grinder is that the Cuisinart has a timer to control the grind, while the Bodum is push-on-push-off. I much prefer the later. The Cuisinart's timer had a minimum setting of 4-cups, and I use a pour-over filter and make one cup at a time so I always had left-over grounds. The Bodum gives me more control over the exact quantity of grounds. I also think the Bodum looks a bit nicer than the Cuisinart.\n\nThe Bodum has a major flaw however. The problem with the Bodum is the container used to hold the grounds. It wedges into the machine by friction with two rubber pieces on the bottom. This makes it extremely difficult (and annoying) to remove from the machine. This is aggravated by the fact that the sides of the grounds container are slanted in kind of a V shape, and the grounds container is smooth, slippery plastic. It's impossible to pull it out of the machine in a controlled fashion. The way I usually do it is to wedge the tips of my fingers between the container and the machine and pry it out. I can't believe they designed this without a better mechanism for holding the grounds container, or at least put some ridges on the sides of it so you could grip it in a normal fashion. The problem is made even worse by the fact the grounds container has no lid; if you lose your grip prying it out of the machine you'll spill grounds everywhere. The Cuisinart's grounds container is much better designed; it snaps in and out smoothly, and has a cover on it to keep the grounds from spilling.\n\nI really like the design of the Bodum and the push-button operation, but this machine is a case of form over function and I won't buy another one if mine breaks and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else either."

            "reviewText": "I bought this grinder about 8 years ago and its still going strong except for one major complaint: they rubber coating that covers the entire grinder has turned into a sticky tar-like substance. That started happening just a year or two after I bought it and has gotten so bad that I was about to throw it out because I couldn't touch it without sticking to it (see photo #1). But luckily, I was able to remove the entire coating wiping it with a rag soaked in 90% isopropyl alcohol. It came out looking nice and shiny, but the alcohol also removed all the markings, so I had to paint new dots and make new labels with a label maker which I then sealed with a clear coat of nail polish. Now it looks as good as new (see photo #2)\n\nMy only other complaint is that it can only grind enough coffee for a 4-5 cup drip coffee maker (which I have). if you need more grinds, you have to wait for the grinder to cool down before grinding more beans. But otherwise it perfectly fits my needs and makes consistent size grounds for both my French Press and Mocha pot.\n\nIf I had to by it again, I would definitely spend the extra money and buy one with the metal body. Or for the same money, I'd probably get the Baratza Encore Coffee Grinder which can grind more beans and also has great reviews (but lacks a timer)."

            "reviewText": "I've been using Bodum products for a long time now, and although expensive, I have always felt it was worth it because the materials and build quality were always topnotch. Not so much with these newer models however, but with that said, the price is also significantly reduced, so in the end I guess it's a fair tradeoff, but one that I'm wondering might tarnish their name a bit. Muddying the waters even further is the fact these cheaper versions share the same design and name as their more expensive brethren, possibly confusing customers on what they're actually buying.\n\nTake this grinder for instance. I currently own A black Bodum Bistro Bur grinder that looks similar to this Bodum Bistro Coffee Grinder. My model feels and operates superior in every way, but is also twice the price at $100. But both models get the most important aspect right: the end grind results are practically the same; or at least good enough I can't tell the difference.\n\nSo in short, it's not the quality I've come to expect from Bodum over the years, but due to its very reasonable price point, I think it's still a great bur grinder for those who don't mind the cheaper parts and loss of some functionality, like auto-shutoff."

I am a sucker for aesthetics and thought it looked cool and loved that you just press a button once and it times the grind. A few months ago the glass broke in an incident that I do not think should have broken it, and a month later it got jammed and the motor stopped working - I cleaned it out and got it going again but cannot get it to grind fine like it used to. Their customer service is non-existent. It now grinds 2x as many beans, half as fine, and I need a fine grind. So it is useless to me - I had to order a Breville unit to replace. If Bodum can make me whole and send me a new one or refund me, i'll remove my review, but I'm just very disappointed with their customer service - their phone # leads to nowhere and the only response I've gotten from them for how to fix is 'reassemble it,' with no details as to how to do this to make the grind fine again - I have already reassembled it 5 times reading online tutorials, etc and it still doesn't grind well. What a disappointment.\n\nI love this grinder! Have had zero issues with it and haven't had to do any maintenance at all (brushing, etc). While it's best for 1-2 servings at a time (they want you to rest it for 5 minutes after 20 seconds of grinding), if that's all you need, snap one up when it goes below $70. I get a consistent fine grind with no issues whatsoever. It looks cool and has a great borosilicate glass receptacle."

It is such a significant improvement to those pulse grinders that don't grind evenly and you have to hold down the button. The hopper holds a generous amount considering the size of the grinder and the machine is low enough that it fits easily under the cabinets in our kitchen. We use it with our Technivorm coffee maker (we are fairly serious coffee drinkers) and the 20 second grind is perfect for 10 cups on that machine. The only knock I have is that it is a bit loud so i just walk away for that period of time. I love the rubber grommet cover over the glass jar eliminates any dust that is so common with coffee grinding."

I have one of the orange ones, it's here in Amazon on a separate 'unavailable' page.\n\nRarely have I bought something that is so reliable and easy to use. It's worked day in and day out without a problem. After each grind I whack the machine a couple times with the heel of my hand to get all the grounds to drop into the glass jar, so it takes a beating but keeps on working. The most I've ever ground is two full 20 second grinds back-to-back, no problem, didn't overheat. But usually I do about 30-40 g at a time (measured on separate scale) which is about 14 seconds at the grind I have it set at (near the middle).\n\nThe machine is compact, fits under the counter easily and doesn't take up much space. I think it looks good too. I bought a Capresso 560.01 Infinity Burr Grinder for a friend and it's a lot bulkier. Then it got stuck on fine grind, but I suspect user error broke something. (I didn't want to get the same machine because it seemed a bit forward, but I should have.)\n\nI don't know how I'd break the Bodum. I've washed the hopper and top burr piece many times, no issues. After removing these pieces I've shaken the base over the sink to remove stray grounds, it's solid.\n\nThe Bodum isn't perfect. The first thing I'd change is the material that the base is made of. After a few years the rubbery plastic gets a bit tacky and picks up dirt and is hard to clean. So there's usually a dark smudge where I pick it up with left hand thumb.\n\nThe second modification would be to make the grind time setting harder to change, like with small detents. The time + grind fineness setting have the biggest effect on taste so they are important not to change once you've got it right.\n\nFinally, it's not quiet. But I've come to like the sound because it means great coffee very soon. And the on/off button (which I just keep on) is upside down because French.\n\nThe machine consistently grinds the same amount at the same setting for years, I've measured with a scale. If it ever dies I will buy another one. It gives you hope when you come across something that just works."

Last night I went to grind the coffee, and it began making a horrible noise. I dumped out the remaining beans, took off the hopper and top grinding assembly to check for a stone or blockage. I didn't find anything, so I did a quick clean, reassembled it, and returned the unground beans. It all ground fine. This morning I went to grind beans for a second pot, and it sounded fine, but the grounds were not exiting through the shoot into the collection container. I took it apart to make sure nothing was stuck and it was fine, no blockage, no reason for the assembly under the second grinder to not be turning but it was not. So I checked how long ago I had purchased it and saw that it was a year and one week but decided to contact the company. They could not or would not do anything for me. The burrs are great, but the plastic assembly under the burrs is not turning to shove the grounds out. After they would not help I took the grinder apart and couldn't find any reason that it should have stopped working. I am disappointed in Bodum for not standing by their product. It costs about $.13 a day s\u200bo it still may be worth the price for a year's use, but I expected to have it longer especially since the burrs are still sharp enough to slice my finger during the examination of the problem!"

            "reviewText": "As this grinder ages, several completely unacceptable issues develop with it. In a nutshell, it is an annoying mess maker! The entire machine develops a static charge such that every part magnetically attracts huge amounts of ground coffee during use. Cleaning up after use is a chore and big time waster. The receiving jar seal wears out and grounds literally spew everywhere during use-all over the counter and the floor. The plastic coating on the machine body and the plastic band around the receiving jar deteriorate over time and develops a most disgusting, sticky residue that cannot be cleaned off. This contributes to the massive amount of grinds that attach to the machine during use. I will say that the grind is consistent and, after 6 years, the motor and blades continue to function well. But unfortunately the unacceptable mess created when grinding will soon land this machine in the trash."

Replacement parts are not available.\n\nAfter checking reviews for comparable units I decided to purchase the same model again because I like the way it works and other models seem to have structural design deficiencies also. Additionally, I'm not willing to spend several hundred dollars for more reliable models.\n\nOriginal review:\nYes, this grinder does result in far better coffee than what I was getting with blade grinders that I've been using for many, many years. The blade grinders resulted in a mixture of partially ground beans to a fine powder.\n\nIn general, burr grinders do produce a static charge to the grindings. I guess its just a fact of life. Prior to purchasing the Bodum, I had bought a Capresso which made such a mess everywhere, including the countertop and all over the machine that I returned it. The Bodum does do a better job at confining the grindings than did the Capresso and I don't have coffee grounds all over the countertop. However, I do have to wait about 5 minutes after grinding to give the static charge time to dissipate. Without the wait, about a tablespoon of grounds clinging to the collection container and when dumping the grounds into the coffee maker, stray grounds tend to fly about landing everywhere.\n\nTwo principal negatives for me are that the motor requires a 5 minute cooldown if an adequate number of grounds cannot be done in 20 seconds. The other is that the timer setting dial is too easy to move. There should be a click to hold it in place for every second. For me, a retired design engineer, these would be major design flaws. I also think that the collection container should have been made of stainless steel instead of glass. If it breaks, I note that a check on the Bodum web site that a replacement is not available.\n\nFor background information, I use French roast and make a 12 cup carafe each morning in a Melkitta drip machine. I originally started with the Bodum by measuring the same amount of beans that I had used in the blade grinder, being a quarter cup for the 12 cup drip maker. What happened is that the Bodum would not grind a quarter cup of beans in 20 seconds, so I had to wait 5 minutes to complete the process, then another 5 minutes to let the static charge dissipate. I've since found that with the quarter cup of beans I was getting coffee a bit stronger than I would like and that the amount of beans ground in 20 seconds is just right. So, I'm using a few less beans because the Bodum produces a more consistent grind and getting a better cup of coffee.\n\nNow, its a wait and see to determine if the grinder will fail early in its life as many have reported."

Manual grind adjustment Fine > Coarse works perfectly. Just move the pointer to the desired grind. I uses the timer dial to get the right amount of coffee. Nice big hopper too, so you can go several days without re-filling. Oily coffee beans can leave a residue. If you use the same coffee over and over and never clean the grinder, I guess you could have issues. Again, I haven't. One of this grinders BEST features is its glass catcher. Anyone who knows grinders can tell you that a plastic catcher will have static and can be messy. Not the Bodum. Static free, no mess. I probably take mine apart twice a year to inspect and clean. Comes apart and re-assembles easily. There is only one thing I don't like about this grinder. The finish on the outside is tacky.

When turning to a more fine setting, the conical burr handles slide out from under the plastic that is holding it down and then the burr is beginning to jump up and down when you try to grind any beans.\n\nAgain, as much as I try to take it apart and put it back together, it has finally, once and for all, stopped working.

Since pros of the unit have been covered in a lot of reviews I'm going to do this as more of a comparison and list of the improvements in this unit over the cheaper one. I grind coffee every day for a french press (coarse grind).\n1. Fairly airtight hopper should keep beans fresher. Hard to be objective about this but the lid seems to be well sealed. The hopper holds slightly more than a half pound of beans.\n2. Better quality grinders that appear to be made out of stainless steel. Overall the grind appears more consistent; the Capresso machine produced some finer dust and the Bodum one is producing some larger shards but these shards are very thin.\n3. Glass grounds bin. This bin plus the design of the lid vs. the plastic bin in the old machine reduces static greatly. If you have ever used a plastic grinder you probably are familiar with the problem of coffee grounds shooting vertically out of the bin at every opportunity. It's actually kind of impressive but creates quite a mess. This bin's lid has a hole in the center which helps prevent this, and with glass, there is much less static overall.\nThe bin is thin glass and I could see it breaking easily, but mine is intact so far.\n4. Quieter, and in addition to being quiet the sound is more pleasant. It doesn't scare my cats.\n5. Precise timer. As others have said, it goes up to 20 seconds only. That is not a problem AT ALL for my french press use of the machine, but if you make large pots of drip coffee it might not be enough.\nOn the Capresso machine, the timer did go much longer, but it was very inaccurate. You could have the timer in a particular spot, move it, and put it back and get a different length of grinding.\n6. Design. This unit has a modern, nice look (I got the off-white one, really just because it was cheapest.)"

            "reviewText": "I've owned 4 burr grinders over the years. A manual, pioneer-style grinder, an inexpensive Braun burr grinder, a very expensive Rancilio Rocky doserless grinder, and this - The Bodum Bistro (mine is orange).\n\nMy Rancilio was my favorite, but it's strictly for grinding straight into a portafilter for espresso. My manual grinder provides the best results, but it takes 3 minutes to grind your coffee each morning. The Braun was very inexpensive (about $35) and was OK, much better than the pulse grinders that give you grounds of all different sizes (not what you want).\n\nSo, how do I like the Bodum Bistro. Well, I love it but I just can't give it five stars, because it's not the ultimate coffee grinder.\n\nWhat it is though is a very well designed, legitimate coffee grinder that makes my mornings very efficient. You set the grind, and you set how long you want to grind and these settings remain, so when you want to grind your beans, you simply depress one button and it takes care of it. It's fairly loud, but it takes only about 10 seconds so it's not too bad. One major advantage of this device is that it employs a glass hopper, instead of Plastic. It's easy to clean, and it doesn't have the static problem you get with plastic hoppers.\n\nI also like the size of this device. It's quite small, but the hopper is relatively large.\n\nAll in all I think they really put some thought into this product. I've been using mine for over a year and I have no intention of replacing it any time soon.\n\nNote - I use this to grind for a one-cup Mellita pourover that uses #2 paper filters. I get a good balance between speed (takes 3 minutes between grinding and taking my first sip (my water is already at 208\u00b0 thanks to my Japanese hot water pot that keeps hot water ready at all times.)\n\nPros-\n\nRelatively inexpensive\nSmall footprint\nGlass hopper for the ground coffee\nLarge hopper for the whole beans\nTimed grind for convenience, simplicity and consistency\nNo need to hold a button while grinding. Just push once and you're good\nMuch better results than with a blade grinder\n\nCons-\n\nResult not quite as good as manual grinder (but better than many other grinders under $300)\n\nRecommendation - If you currently use a blade grinder, do yourself a favor and move up to a burr grinder. It makes an enormous difference. This is a very good one."

This one (11750-01US) which Amazon calls the Standard Burr Grinder, has a plastic grind catcher and throws grinds all over regardless of how the grind catcher is installed. It's so bad that there are posts debating how to prevent the mess. It also does not have a timer, so will run continuously until you shut it off. The other model (10903-01US) Amazon's Premium Burr grinder, comes with the glass grind catcher, has a built in timer, and a clutch to protect the burr and gears.\n\nI have both and the Standard grinder builds up grinds in the top hopper that requires removal of the hopper to clean quite often. The premium model also has a clutch to prevent damage to the unit in case something not grindable, such as a small stone, gets into the grinder. That and the plastic gears, all but ensures that the standard model will fail sooner than later."

Just silence. I cleaned it out thoroughly, got out the manual and took it apart and used a soft brush to sweep out all the coffee. Reassembled and ... still nothing. It's a mystery. I used the burr grinder in my Krups coffee maker daily for years and it still works fine. I'm very disappointed that this grinder failed and so soon. I called Bodum support and she said they would mail a replacement to me after I send them a .pdf of the receipt, which I did. But I got an email reply saying they were completely out of stock of those, in any color. I am not sure what will happen now. Is this item being discontinued? I would not choose this grinder again, given this experience.\nEDIT: Dec 2013 - I re-contacted Bodum in September, just before the one year warranty would end in November, and attached all the emails from the spring. They never replied but in a week a new grinder showed up at my front door. Editing my review to add a star since they did come through."

            "reviewText": "Having used both Capresso and Cuisinart grinders previously, both of which had issues with static discharge causing grounds to fly out of the container, it was a relief to discover this Bodum grinder. Unlike the other brands, this one dispenses grounds into a glass (rather than plastic) container, thereby avoiding the static issues that had plagued the others. Amazon reviewers of various brands of coffee grinders have reported widely different experiences with the static electricity problem, so what works for one person may not work for another. But if you have had static issues with other brands of grinders, this Bodum may be worth your consideration.\n\nThe instructions indicate that this grinder should not be run for more than 20 seconds without a five minute (!!) break between grinds. That's hardly optimal for anyone who wants to brew a moderately large pot of coffee. To produce the quantity of grounds that we require to brew eight cups of moderately strong with our drip coffee maker, we need to run the Bodum grinder for 20 seconds, and then another 15 seconds. We have found that taking a short break between the two grindings (measured by the time it takes to fill the coffee maker with water and install the paper filter) seems to be sufficient; at least our Bodum grinder hasn't yet overheated or shut down using this procedure. Fortunately, it comes with a two-year warranty, which should be sufficient to let us know whether our operating procedure is ultimately harmful to the device."

We've been using it daily for 2 1/2 years and it's pretty tough. When my son needs to give an expensive gift, this is one of his go to picks. Two minor nits. We're a two coffee lover household; his espresso and my French press. Making that adjustment by rotating the hopper is a bit of a pain and heaven help the other party if I'm first to the kitchen in the morning and forget to check if he's swung it back to my grind after his use! However, the thinking behind implementing this mechanism probably led significantly to keeping the price down so that's a decent tradeoff. If he hadn't been doing months of experimentation on pre-ground roasts I would think the solution is a second grinder. Not as outlandish as it sounds as it doubles the life of the one machine, we always would have a backup and someday he will fly the coop. The other nit is no fault of the Bodum, but of the love of the bean. Grinding is messy. Some people buy vacuumns just for this; I can't bring myself to that. Several years ago I purchased the Plastic Stackable Jewelry Tray 1\" Deep Black ([...] on Amazon and that solves the problem by coraling 99% of the effluence and is just large enough to hold the grinder and a small canister of beans. Still messy, but a contained mess. Cheers, Al"

The motor would spin and the beans would bounce around in the hopper with only a few getting through not much smaller than when I put them in. I could not figure it out. I took it all apart and examined how it should grind and it made no sense at all. Just as I was about to break it all apart in frustration I discovered I had left the top part of the grinding burr out after cleaning. I put it back in and it was like a miracle. The lesson I learned from this is never grind more beans at a time than the reservoir can hold and always keep track of what you take apart. If you grind more beans than what the reservoir will hold, they will back up and clog, especially the oily beans. By the way, I contacted Bodum customer service not asking for a new one but just ideas how to fix it and they offered a free replacement as long as I had the receipt up to two years after purchase. I did not even buy it from them but from Macy's online and they still offered to replace it. Still think the coffee doesn't taste as good as out of my cheap Krupps blade grinder but its a lot easier to use."

I was able to find one of these Bodum burr grinders at a local store at a very good price and gave it to my husband as an early Christmas gift. We got the red color, which is a fun accent (we leave it on our counter). We have had ours for over a month now and use it daily. The results are great. We make coffee using the french press, using a cone drip (when we only need one serving) and also with a traditional coffee maker. The beans ground by this grinder work well with the three methods of making coffee that we use. Anyway, I would definitely recommend this burr grinder to others. One thing that I did notice is that it is not as big as the burr grinder my brother has (his is quite tall), which I see as a positive feature. The little glass jar with the silicone lid on this grinder is also a great touch. I thought at first that it would leave a big mess, but it actually does quite a nice job of keeping all the grounds in, and not all over the counter top."

It makes very little noise, grinds quickly and there is no static because of the glass. It takes a few seconds to grind coffee beans for my first cup of the day. I've seen reviews where people complain that you can't grind a whole can at once, doesn't that really go against why you grind coffee beans in the first place - so that the ground coffee is fresh? Anyway to each his/her own opinion. I do not think anyone could go wrong with this Burr Grinder unless you want to grind enough coffee for a party - then, of course, you need something else. But if you want a few cups or one this is the grinder you will be happy with. Go crazy and get a red or green one, go against black and chrone."

I had been using a blade grinder for use with a Bodum Chambord French press and have never been able to get a consistent grind. I always ended up with chunks of beans mixed with very fine powder. There's just no way with that style grinder to get a uniform grind, something that's imperative to get the most out of your French press.\n\nThe Bistro grinder has an attractive, well thought out design. The top canister holds about 3/4 lb or so of whole beans and is sealed by a rubber gasket with a silicone rim to ensure they stay fresh. The grind setting is easy to set and goes from coarse (French Press) to Espresso. The timer is nice in that it doesn't tick down like an egg timer but stays where you set it. It's great once you figure out the time needed to get the right amount of grounds for your morning brew as you don't have to reset the timer every day. Grinding is quiet and produced a very consistent coarse grind without many \"fines\". I haven't used the other settings yet so can't speak to those. The taste of coffee from the press is markedly improved with less sediment. There is a 20 second limit to each grind time with a recommended 5 minute wait between grinds; worth considering if you need a lot of grounds at once but not an issue for me. I use about 4 tablespoons of grounds in my press and it takes about 10 seconds to produce that much.\n\nThe glass canister has a nifty rubber top that sits flush with the grinder housing and prevents dust from spilling out. The glass is also less static-prone than the plastic in my blade grinder. The whole unit is easy to disassemble and clean as well. Also, there is a cord wrap space under the base to help minimize cord clutter.\n\nOverall, the build quality is just excellent with every component serving a function and working as it should. For the price, quality, aesthetic, etc. this was the right choice for me. Highly recommended."

To familiarize myself with the grinder, I carefully followed the instructions and ground my first batch. Freshly ground coffee has the most amazing aroma. Much to my surprise, now the coffee tastes so much better that I've started drinking it again.\n\nI use the medium setting since I have a drip coffee maker and it works perfectly. It is noisy but it has to be - it's grinding hard coffee beans, after all. The only problem I have is that it's a bit messy. No matter how hard I try to shake out the last bit of grounds, some still manage to escape and get on the countertop. Easy cleanup but, still, something better avoided.\n\nA nice-to-have would be a lid for the ground coffee container. It comes with a plastic lid that has a hole it in through which the grounds fall. However, if there are leftover grounds, it would be nice to seal them in the container.\n\nIt's well built and sturdy, plus the grinder's outer surface has a non-slip rubbery feel to it. The power cord can be stored under the unit, but it's more trouble than it's worth. Cleaning the grinder gear is easy, too."

            "reviewText": "The grinder actually grinds fine, but I hate how messy it is. There are coffee grounds left in the shoot, and when you replace the glass jar, grounds dump onto the base and inevitably over surfaces around. You have to vacuum up every time you use it. Another less annoying design flaw is the lid of the bean silo. The flange is very shallow. There is no feedback letting you know that the lid is actually in place, and it pops up very easily. Bodum's small appliances look cool but have many fundamental design flaws. I have the grinder and the Bistro coffeemaker; I purchased them for their aesthetic appeal. However, if you are after performance, choose another brand."

            "reviewText": "This grinder is squeaky clean and tidy, and that's been my biggest problem with grinders. The glass container with a great rubber/plastic lid keeps stray grounds under control. I notice a couple of other reviewers who have complained about stray coffee grounds but I don't find that to be a problem. It looks great, and it does a precise job of grinding at the various settings. The 20 second limit for \"avoiding overheating the motor\" is a pain if you are wanting to grind very much coffee at once. In other words, you are supposed to let the motor cool for 5 minutes for every 20 seconds of operation. This could be a deal breaker for some potential buyers.\n\nThe 20 second limitation was not a problem for the first ten months or so, because the grinder would generate about six tablespoons of coffee which was fine. That efficiency diminished during the last couple of months until it only produced about 2 1/2 tablespoons. However, upon reporting this to Bodum they replaced it with a new one, which is fine."

            "reviewText": "I'm very surprised this item has a 4 star rating. Perhaps it has something to do with the dark roast beans I tend to favor or maybe I just the one bad unit in the batch.... I don't know... what I do know is I'm rarely this disappointed with a purchase.\n\nThe unit worked okay for the first couple weeks but it always took a long time to grind all the beans. It didn't seem to matter if I had it on a fine setting for my coffee machine or on a coarse setting for my french press. The unit requires that you preselect how many seconds it will run for before you turn it on. The knob only goes up to 20 seconds. I always found this to be very frustrating because to grind enough coffee for an entire pot, I had to run it for at least 40 to 60 seconds. The beans progressed through the grinder very slowly. THEN I read that after 20 seconds of operation, it is recommended to give it a 5 minute break or one risks damaging the motor...seriously? 20 seconds? I would be lucky to get enough beans for a single cup of coffee in that time. I don't know about you but I don't want to spend 20 minutes grinding my coffee every morning just so my poor little coffee grinder doesn't overwork itself.\n\nThen things went from bad to worse: beans just stopped grinding...period. I thought maybe it was just clogged up so I took it apart and cleaned the grinder itself and the dispenser chute and everything else I could find that had coffee grounds on it... which were everywhere. By the way, did I mention this was because the unit stopped grinding beans part way through? So when I took it apart, whole beans and grounds spilled everywhere, despite my best precautions. Cleaning seemed to restore the device's original lackluster but still functional performance....for a short time.\n\nThings kept going downhill from there.... I went from having to clean it every couple of days to every single day and eventually to the point where I would have to clean it out 2 or three times just to get enough beans for one measly pot of coffee. What would happen is about 20% of the beans would actually be ground then it would just clog up and while it was still running and sounding like it was working fine....no further beans would be moving through it. So I would keep having to take it apart with beans still in it (as I mentioned before, making a big mess and wasting coffee beans) to get a little bit more ground each time before progress would come to a halt. Please don't forget that according to the instructions, I should be waiting 5 minutes in between each clog before turning the machine on again. I suspect they designed it to clog up so one would have something to do while they were waiting for the motor to rest.\n\nTo sum up: I have no explanation for why some people have had better results with this than myself and can only speculate that maybe dark roasted beans are harder to grind than medium or light roast. My firm opinion though is that this coffee grinder is a complete an utter piece of worthless garbage. It would be a considerable waste of your time and money to purchase it-- you'd be better of grinding your coffee with your teeth. Buy something else!"

At first I was a little worried as some reviews mentioned motor burn out. Because of that I was careful (especially at first) not to grind too much coffee at a time. But, hey! having fresh ground coffee is the point, right? Typically we fill the hopper 3/4 full and have used our Bodum every day or every other day since we purchased it. Our previous Capresso, though long lived, would only grind (barely) for a gold cone filter at the last setting. We would never have been able to do espresso. The Bodum's grind choices are across the board. We're grinding for the gold cone just shy of middle. Too true that the design, with a glass container, considerably reduces the grounds flying all over (as our previous Capresso experience.) There's still clean up after grinding but not nearly as much. Also, its easy to take apart for cleaning and put back together! And, finally, we love the look of it."

            "reviewText": "Upon receiving the unit, I tested it by turning the motor on and rotating the hopper toward fine. At about 1/4 of the way towards max. fine, it started to sound like metal on metal. l think what was happening is this unit was out of spec on the clearance between the grinding plates. I dared to turn in all the way fine for only a second and metal sound got so much worse the motor started to bog down. This is with no coffee beans.\nI decided to keep it, thinking maybe it needed to break in. After using for a few weeks on the middle to coarser end of the scale, I occasionally went a little finer, and always got the same metal grinding sound. Definitely was never able to go all the way to fine. I was afraid I'd have metal bits in my coffee.\nI have been around several other brands of burr grinder and never experienced this, including a Baratza Encore that a friend has. The Baratza could be turned fully to fine and still sounded smooth.\nI finally decided to return it and ended up getting the Capresso Infinity. It works great all the way down to fine.\nThe only reason I give this two stars is that it really is a slick looking, nicely (at least aesthetically) designed device. I wish it worked because it is really compact and looked nice on the counter. I loved the rubberized textured enclosure and the red highlights. Too bad the manufacturing controls around the mechanical parts is sub par. Such a shame that companies put all their $ into marketing and throw the quality control out the window."

However, there are two problems you will eventually experience. First, the burrs get dull, and Bodum does not sell replacement parts. It will take longer and longer to grind the same amount of coffee. The second problem is in the switch mechanism. When I press the start button, the amount of time it grinds has become random. Sometimes it grinds as long as expected for a given setting, and sometimes only for a second or two. This morning I hade to press the button 25-30 times to make coffee. I have taken it apart to thoroughly vacuum it out, but that did not help. My guess is the electronics. If you are handy, your could replace that board too, but it isn't available either. I am actually looking at the Amazon today to find a replacement grinder."

I've seen others complain about the mess with scooping it out, but that is going to happen with most any unit that doesn't directly dump into the portafilter. You could hold the portafilter under this unit, but I don't think the time can be set quite that exact to get just the right amount of grounds. (it is only a 100 dollar unit after all, the second cheepest out of five I have).\n\nIt even took on a rock today. BTW, those who describe the unit making noise and jumping around and/or not working need to check to see if there is a rock in the grinders. It is not all that uncommon to get them in bags of beans and if your lucky the machine grinds it up and there is no problem. Mine was jammed so bad I had to crush the rock with a pair of needle nose pliers before I could get it apart. I cleaned it up and waited for the thermal breaker to cool down (another thing people need to check on). I was happy to find it fired up once cooled down and is grinding beans just fine.\n\nWhile it is true the grind needs to be adjusted daily, this usually has more to do with the weather, humidity, temp, and such. This is actually normal. Ask any Barista. That is why grinders have so many settings, or the newer ones now are stepless so as to be able to adjust infinitly. I will admit here though that this thing can go to extreems, that is from an 18 second shot one day to a 32 second shot the next. Readjust, and enjoy."

Now i put it on 15 sec and after it is done push it again cause the blades are not as sharp, this gets me 30 sec total cause the blades are less sharp but this is a minor issue.\nIf you don't know an arabica from a robusto bean just get a hand held unless you are rich with no debts. If you always grind your own and you are not in debt buy it. It does not result in using less coffee but i am fussy and find it a little easier than dealing with a hand held cause i dump the caraffe into a paper filter over the sink and this is slightly easier than doing it with a hand held."

The Bistro has a few enhancements over the Barista, notably the glass coffee catcher, a timer that actually works, and an on/off switch. Personally, I think a burr grinder and fresh beans are the best investments you can make to improve home brewed coffee. This grinder makes an extremely consistent grind, which means less sludge in my french press coffee. For my 10 cup drip coffee machine, I've always used 1/3 cup of beans, which the Bistro grinds in about 18 seconds, so the 20 second time limit is perfect. Like others, I've found that the finest grind is a little too fine for my espresso pot, so I set it a notch or two coarser. For the money, ($79, but prices seem to vary) this is a best buy."

Grinding for espresso is much more a challenge and I would think this entry level grinder would be hard pressed to do that well but once again it is an entry level machine so you can not expect it to be great at everything.\nI only use it for drip brewing in my Bunn Phase Brew (HG) and it is great for that.\n\u00a0BUNN HG Phase Brew 8-Cup Home Brewer\n\nIt appears to produce a nice consistent grind, I notice some large pieces at the large end of its grinding range. Medium and finer grinds look very consistent in grind size.\nNo noticeable dust produced..\nThe overall design appears to be good, Simple to operate, once you get it dialed in it is basically push one button every morning and it will do the rest.\nThe timer remains set where you want it until you change it which is a feature I like.\nThe glass grounds holder makes static buildup practically a non issue. Appears to be built well and is an attractive unit.\nBeing so new we have no idea how long it will last.\n\nPrice wise I will say it can be bought for much less if you check around. I got mine for $[...] shipped from BedBath&Beyond. Use one of their mail out %20 off coupons and if you ask they will even wave the shipping, not stocked in store, Most times it is hard to beat Amazon's prices but this is one time I was able to.\n\nFor the price I paid this is a value for someone wanting to get into a burr grinder. It is a entry level machine as grinders do sell for many hundreds and even thousands of dollars..\n\nYou pair this up with some good Freshly roasted Beans and a good brewer and you can produce a very good cup of coffee.\n\n8 MONTH UPDATE:\n\nI have been using this grinder for 8 months now. I use it every day and it has performed flawlessly. I grind on the coarse setting for use in a Clever Coffee Dripper\u00a0Clever Coffee Dripper\u00a0and the grinder performs like a champ..\n\nI want to pass on an experience I had this morning... Somehow I managed to crack the glass grounds container. SO, I went to Bodum's web site to order a replacement.. No luck on the U.S. site but found it on the U.K. site. But it was out of stock and upon further digging found the U.K. site won't ship to the U.S. hummm SO... I placed a call to the U.S. contact number and the extremely nice helpful person with Bodum fixed my problem in 2 minutes. She said it is not an item they have for sale but she would look around the office and see if there was one they could send me... I offered to pay but she politely declined my offer and took my info and let me know she had one she is sending out to me today....\n\nThat is what I would call great customer service...\n\nMy opinion of the grinder has not changed from my initial review. I think for a low volume situation it is a very good basic burr grinder. After all $85 for a Burr grinder is definitely an entry level unit.. I do not do expresso so I can not comment on its ability for that but for a 1 or 2 person coffee situation it is a nice option. I have read that some users would like it to grind a bit coarser and that could be one thing to consider (French Press types maybe) and I want to repeat it is not suited for a high volume situation..\n\nBut what it does do it does very well..\n\nI have never experienced any \"Static\" problems, I never have loose grounds on the counter ever, and it is basically a dump the beans in the hopper, press one button, and it's a done deal.. Love the timer that stays set where you put it.. easy daily ritual.. Takes me probably 10 seconds for the whole grind process (dumping beans in pressing button retrieving grounds). 15 seconds tops.\n\nAfter 8 months I find that it always gives me a consistent grind day in and day out..\n\nOh and its a nice looking unit as well..\n\n05/2013 UpDate:\n2 Years + later and grinder is still going strong. No issues what so ever. This product is an A+ for a entry level Burr Grinder.. All my previous info still stands ..\n\nHowever it Can be bought cheaper elsewhere..."

For the original purchase price I'm sure there were alternatives to the parts they designed: using larger gears or using a tougher plastic are two options that come to mind quickly -- and I'm not even a product engineer.\n\nThese gears are designed to wear out pretty quickly intentionally and you should consider your 'investment' as disposable. Spare gears, replacements, are not available through the Bodom spare parts website. This means that Bodom has shot itself in the foot by designing and selling a product that works fairly well, for a while, but then fails and can not be brought back into service by ordinary users. It says in the manual that the only user service is to clean the burrs and to clean the outside of the unit, but if you do even a little bit of internet research on the Bodum 10903 you will find the gears don't last very long -- they are the most frequent failure-poijnt, but I have not found any source or mention of available replacement gears.\n\nThe grinder is good in a number of ways: color, outward design (neat plastic funnel bean holder, good quality grounds cup, soft plastic covering over most of the machine), function (pretty good grind), but its short intended span of service (lifespan) means that it is a poor buy.\n\nNow to find something better!"

            "reviewText": "This is my first burr grinder and I had high hopes. I used it a couple of times this morning for the first time. Like others said, I don't think the coarse grind (when set to the unit's little French press symbol) makes large enough particles for a French press. But that's fairly minor. The lid to the top bean loader compartment is really dorky and awkward to use. A fixed, hinged lid would have been better.\n\nBodum says you can store a week's worth of beans into this, but the unit's not airtight so I'm not doing that and then taste my coffee get more stale each day. Before this, I'd only ever used a blade grinder. To me, the coffee from the Bodum tasted more bitter, but I'm just starting out with it and maybe need to ride the learning curve.\n\nOverall, the whole unit feels cheap. The plastic bean loader/grind adjuster moves around a lot as you adjust it and the unit itself is very light in weight.\n\nThe 20 second timer engine burnout factor shows extremely poor design. If the engine is that sensitive, why install it in the first place? Still, I'd have to think it would be impossible for Bodum to confidently pin the blame for engine failure on the user if, theoretically, someone were to turn the grinder on two or three consecutive times without waiting five minutes.\n\nI'm considering returning this for something else. Maybe a refurbished Starbucks burr grinder, which is made by Baratza and available for $80 from their Website. The Bodum Bistro may just be too inexpensive and cheaply constructed to hope for a good quality burr grinder.\n\nUPDATE: Oct. 26, 2011\n\nAfter almost a week I like this grinder a lot more. The bitterness I tasted vanished when I began steeping the grounds in my French press for 3 1/2 to four minutes instead of just two. Very smooth coffee now.\n\nI also think that you can probably live on the edge and run the grinder for two consecutive grinding sessions without waiting five minutes. I have not done this, but I know someone who has and her Bistro is still purring along great. I can see how running it for five minutes straight could damage the motor. But 30 to 40 seconds?\n\nStill feels flimsy and cheap, which I suppose it is. But this is a very good grinder in its price range and I think you'd need to spend a lot more for something better.\n\nUPDATE: May 17th, 2013\n\nI must have been luckier than those who gave this grinder one star because it broke soon after they bought it. Still going strong regardess of whether I grind lightly roasted beans or very dark beans. I still believe the whole unit feels flimsy and cheap, but it still works fine, and I'm getting consistently sized grinds for French press. There are always some \"fines\" as they're called, but very few compared to the the coarse granules I get. If you search a bit you can buy this for under $100, which makes it an amazing buy. I got it on Amazon for $67. Well worth it even if you pay more. Think of all the expensive coffee you now buy that can't possibly taste its best when ground with a blade grinder.\n\nI've read a few comments from folks in the coffee business that whatever device you use to brew coffee is merely an accessory to the grinder. I tend to agree. If your grinder makes uneven, inconsistently sized coffee, what you end up drinking is going to suffer regardless of your coffee maker. I now steep the grounds in my French press for a minimum of five minutes, usually six, and the taste is much improved. I'm also roasting my own beans so my coffee is about as fresh as you can get it unless you grow your own."

Using my Technivorm KTBS coffee maker and Starbucks House Blend, which I always buy in one pound bags from Sams, I brewed up a batch. It appeared to be less bitter, more aromatic, and EXTREMELY similar to any great cup of coffee that I have ever had in a coffee shop.

We have had no problems with this item after our first month of use.\n\nThis being said, there are a small few recommendations for Bodum:\n1. The glass container is a great complement to the grinder. However, it would be great if there were extra containers available for purchase with air-tight lids. This way there would be no need to mention the next recommendation.\n\n2. Grinding different kinds of beans is a daily occurrence in my household. I drink espresso, my family drinks regular eight o' clock Columbian coffee. So, what happens when you empty the bag into the grinder for ease of use? The next person has to come along, unscrew the hopper, and empty it into a secondary container. Sure, you can try to only put in the amount you want, but it is a little difficult to hit that margin every time. Easy solution? See #1.\n\n3. This brings me to the final suggestion. When grinding with this machine, the glass container really helps with static electricity. Yes, there is a very small amount of grounds that escapes every time, but it is in no way a major issue. The issue comes with the way the grounds are delivered to the container. They come vertically through the hopper into the conical burr grinding wheels. From there, they change direction to horizontally flow into the container. The problem that arises is the excess grounds that have just been ground, but were not able to be pushed through to the container. This is fixed by lightly tapping the side of the unit a few times while tipping it slightly forward, but this could have been offset by a small adjustment in the delivery system.\n\nAll in all, this is a product that I would recommend to just about anyone. Maybe not someone who is grinding lbs of coffee a day, but certainly the average homeowner who is looking to up his or her coffee savvy. The unit is well made and looks great on our counter sitting next to a Bunn coffee maker."

I just set the grinding time a little longer when I make my cup for the ride to work. She she moves it to her preferred time setting for her cup. On the weekend the full 20 second grind is perfect when we make 2 cups. Everything has a high quality feel to it and the the motor and grinder really do the job.\n\nSome people find it annoying that you have to wait 5 minutes between grinding sessions. So yes, if you make a large quantity of coffee at a time you should consider that. In my opinion, the glass cup is not 100% static fee. A very small amount may stick but I found that just tapping the bottom of the jar makes virtually all of the coffee fall out into my coffee maker basket. Plus, this machine is way better than the $60 Cuisinart grinder we used to have. That one had a plastic jar and there was a ton of heavy static. On that one, about 20% of the ground coffee would stick to the jar which was pretty annoying. It basically wouldn't come out no matter what.\n\nOverall the Bodum blows away the Cuisinart. The Cuisinart was much louder and the build quality was much lower. We burned through 2 Cuisinart's, that's why we switched to the Bodum. All in all, a really nice machine for the money."

Sometimes I use a Japanese mesh coffee filter which requires a very fine grind. Other times I use a standard coffee maker or French Press. Each grind has worked beautifully for me. However, I do have a problem with flecks of ground coffee adhering to the glass receptacle. One review said the glass would prevent this. At first I didn't have flecks but after about a month I did. Still, it's simple to use a soft towel to wipe out the glass receptacle when I change grinds. I wouldn't trade this coffee grinder for another."

I recommend this among quite a few other brands to customers as a good tool to use at home while making coffee. Cheers!"

The type of glass is a nice feature, but the company has no replacements. None. You can't order extras when you buy the machine. So you're out of luck when it happens. You have to use something else to catch the grinds, and that's harder than you think. Consider well before you purchase."

            "reviewText": "As others have mentioned in their four and five star reviews, this thing has a flaw. The max time in can run is 20 seconds and then you have to wait 5 minutes to run it again or risk motor burn out. Well I use a manual drip coffee cone most of the time. We also have a french press and espresso maker. I grind six scoops of beans for our carafe. It takes ~30 - 35 seconds to grind the six scoops so I have it set to 20 seconds. I grind for 20 sec, wait 4-5 minutes and then grind the rest. Waiting to grind is no fun. Why did they design this thing to run only 20 seconds every 5 minutes? This is annoying. Otherwise I have no complaints. I have used it twice so far. The mess is minimal and the grind is very even. It grinds so much better than the blade grinder we have been using for years.\n\n10/10/2013 - I have had it ~3 years now. It is still running well. I upped the rating to 4 stars. The manual that came with the grinder stated to not run it more than once every five minutes to avoid overheating the motor. I still don't use twice in a row. I run it once, let it sit at least a minute or two while the water is heating and then run it again, usually 10-15 more seconds will finish the amount of coffee I use."

            "reviewText": "I have a confession to make.\n\nI don't have either an axe OR coffee beans that need grinding. What I love is authentic steel cut oatmeal. The problem with most varieties is that the grains are hard, coarsely cut and require overnight soaking and a long time stirring and cooking on the stove top. Most mornings I'd just give up and pour cold cereal out of the box. Or use microwave packets...not the same texture or flavor...sigh.\n\nBut this lovely coffee grinder makes a perfect grist mill. On the fine setting, I can make oat flour to mix in for multi-grain homemade bread.\n\nTen seconds on the coarse setting grinds enough steel cut oats for one breakfast serving. Twenty seconds makes 2 servings. When grinding oats, the amount you put in the top will be the same volume coming out at the bottom so don't put more oats than what the receptacle below can contain.\n\nOnce the oats are ground, they can still be soaked overnight if you like that flavor, or you can stir in water and microwave for 2 minutes. Be sure to stir the oats before microwaving them as if you let them settle out they won't soak up the milk or water properly. Season to taste. Authentic rustic flavor and really sticks to your ribs!\n\nLove my coffee grinder. Wondering if I could use it to make my own cornmeal?"

I really liked the idea of a glass receptacle to prevent static issues and I saw this grinder had good reviews and wasn't as expensive as the KitchenAid. Now that we've had it for a few weeks, we're generally pretty happy with it. However, the glass receptacle doesn't completely eliminate the static issues. It's not as bad as ones with a plastic receptacle, but it's still there. Perhaps this is an inevitable side effect of burr grinders? Has anyone solved this problem?\n\nI would recommend this grinder to anyone looking for a good burr grinder, but just don't expect it to be static free."

            "reviewText": "I bought this Grinder for my husband in January for his birthday. I was worried about some of the reviews of the machine getting clogged up, the 20 second timer, and whether or not it would grind nicely for espresso which the only thing my husband would use it for.\n\nIt is loud, but it is grinding coffee...it is going to be loud. My sister has a $400 grinder and her's is much louder than this one. My bedroom is across from the kitchen and when I am sleeping and he is grinding coffee, the noise is not enough to wake me and I am not a heavy sleeper.\n\nIt took a couple of cups for him to figure out the setting to get the grind just right for the espresso, but he has it all set now and it grinds wonderfully. We use the beans from the local coffee shop that he LOVES and now with this grinder and his espresso machine he says the coffee tastes EXACTLY like he bought it from the coffee shop only we are not spending $4 for it. The machine has never clogged up and it cleans up nicely. The glass grind catcher is nice because there is no static in the cup. The rubber seal on top of the catcher is wonderful. There is VERY LITTLE loss of coffee with this machine. Barely even enough to even clean. It is literally about 7-10 tiny pieces of grind that the machine losses. SERIOUSLY! My sister's losses about 1/8tsp and she spent 5X more.\n\nWe have not used it for large quantities of coffee so we have not had to worry about the 20 second timer, but we have used it to make multiple cups of espresso back to back. We just grind and brew the first cup and when that one is done we grind the second one. He has used it every day sometimes twice a day for the last 6 months and it is wonderful. He loves it and every time he makes his coffee he says that it is the best gift he has ever gotten. $90 well spent if you ask me considering the best gift he had ever gotten before this was his 50\" flat panel TV that was $1400!"

Ironically, the coffee from the blade grinder tastes better than the coffee from this $120 mistake.\n\nBecause I'm not the only one encountering this issue, it seems this product needs to be redesigned to offer more predictable grind consistency."

After my last blade grinder died I was going to replace it with another. Doing some research I turned my attention to a burr grinder but thought it was too much money for just a cup of coffee. The Bodum Bistro changed my opinion quickly. I found out on my first cup that the grind is everything. That is the only thing I have changed and I consistently get the coffee shop quality I was looking for 1/4th the cost.\n\nWhat I specifically like about the Bodum are all the little things. The rubberized casing makes for a nice tactile feel along with sure grip taking it in and out of the cupboard. The glass coffee catcher eliminates all static and makes for a clean machine. The variable grind setting is easily marked. The simple push button and timed operation helps make every cup the same great taste as the previous one. The rubber cover for the coffee catcher keeps it in place snugly along with eliminating coffee getting everywhere. Even the cord holder has been thought through to allow you to have just the right amount of cord out at a time.\n\nI've been using the Bodum for a month and have not had any problems with the grinder or the motor. I clean the machine each time I refill the bean container. So far so good. I am looking forward to a lot more use out of this excellent machine."

Well a regular burr grinder could be heard for about 15 feet outside of my house when it was running. I couldn't take it anymore and decided to purchase a new conical burr grinder because they are quieter and do a much better job of grinding the coffee beans. I looked on amazon and found the Bodum conical burr grinder. I liked the look of the Bodum, the black one, grinder and decided to buy it. I am extremely impressed with the performance of this grinder. It generates a uniform grind and the glass hopper really does a good job at not stinking to the grounds. The one thing I can say bad is a 20 second maximum grind time is a bit off putting. Other than that I do not regret this purchase at all and like it even better than the Breville I had for two years."

I can take a small spoonful of ground coffee, spread it on the counter and see a wide range of size from dust to larger sized chips. Perhaps this is just a defective unit, but it's useless for espresso. Grinding more coarsely for drip or french press works fine, but then so does a 20 dollar blade grinder. I've had much better luck with the Capresso Infinity and Baratza burr grinders."

I found that the instructions for this grinder were not that good. They have numbers for each part of the machine, but do not explain what each part is for. I really had to figure it out for myself. What I liked about the grinder is that you can grind as fine or a course as you like. I think that is helpful for all different kinds of coffee machines. It ground very well.\n\nOnce I experimented with this machine, I found that it was easy to use. What I didn't like is the mess when you clean it. I got coffee grounds all over the counter top when I took it apart. When you are done grinding you must clean the two plastic bowls, the one you put the beans in and the one they go into when they are ground. The plastic casing causes some of the grounds to fall out when you remove the bowl. This is where the grounds spill on your counter. You must also clean the grinding mechanism.\n\nThe Bodum bistro-electric burr coffee grinder does a great job, but is messy and a pain to clean. I would recommend this if you really want to grind your own coffee. If you don't mind it preground I would recommend grinding it in the store before you buy it. If you coffee only comes in beans I would recommend this grinder for you."

I haven't been happy with the espresso from this machine, and eventually decided to look at more expensive but better made machines.\n\nFor espresso: not durable enough. The first machine I got used. It was unable to grind finely enough for espresso, the coffee was consistently weak. I later received a new machine as a gift. It made fine espresso for a few months, but then began to act the same way the first one had. The coffee was too weak. To verify the problem was the grounds, I purchased some coffee from my local coffee shop and asked them to grind it for me. Their grind worked just fine. Cleaning the burrs didn't fix the Bodum Bistro, so I started shopping for a new machine.\n\nFor pour-through: the Bistro works, but is kind of expensive. A whirly-blade grinder is more durable, less expensive, and is fine for pour-through coffee.\n\nFor french press: perfect. Gives a consistent coarse grind. The coffee is good, and has no stray coffee grounds."

So, when I finally bought the bodum, I asked to open the box and make sure the cap had a snug fit to the jar. This is my first burr grinder, and I just don't know how I had gone so long without it. It's incredibly simple to use and produces fantastic espresso grind. Additionally, I'm very impressed by the cleanliness of the machine.

We have not needed to grind beans for more than 20 seconds to get the amount we want, so we don't know if you really have to wait before you can grind again. It is easy to adjust the fineness of the grind. The glass carafe for the ground coffee has not had any static build up and is not at all messy. So it does pretty much what the description and reviews said it would, and it makes really fresh, delicious coffee with our Mr. Coffee Espresso machine."

I read several of the reviews for this coffee grinder and decided to take a chance. *the motor is not the best, *many were returned because the grind time timer doesn't always give you the time set on the dial, and *the ground coffee doesn't stick to the glass.\n\nThe motor is good (for 20 seconds every five minutes) and the grinder will grind the beans so fine that when set for he finest selection, the grinds are very close to qualifying for ground Turkish coffee. I backed off two settings and the grounds are still the finest ground espresso coffee I used, including products from Italy. I still produce a great creama from a counter-top machine. No problems there.\n\nNow for the title I wrote. I actually read the instructions and they are very clear and concise. 'Do not run the grinder motor more than 20 seconds every five minutes for it could damage the motor.' On my grinder, I set the timer for 20 seconds and sometimes I'll get ten seconds, other times 12 or 15 but only about a third of the time will I get a full 20 second grind. Just like the 36 hour a week union worker, when it works, there's no question the product will be of quality fit for a shipping magnate sipping espresso in their villa in the Aegean Sea. However, I have had to break the contract with my grinder and make it toil so I have sufficient coffee for my daily double cappuccino, dry. It has not stopped in a wildcat strike,...yet. Oh yeah, the coffee grinds not sticking to the walls of the catch container; there are more important problems in our lives than to worry over this one. The grinds do not adhere to the sides, this is a true statement. Could be.. the material used for the catch container is a superior grade of silicon used in the manufacturing of the container is mined only from the secret location of Atlantis.\n\nBodum should invest in higher quality motors or should stick to glasses."

There is NO timer function. It is totally manual on-off. So if you keep your beans in the hopper you will have to learn how to count to 15 or so to know when to stop grinding. Its probably a very good product, it's just not what they are telling you it is at the moment. Please disregard this review if it comes to pass that they fix the product description."

This maybe the advertised clutch engaging to save the grinder in case you have a rock, but I had none. Whatever the reason the only way I can grind coffee with this is to slowly drop a few beans at a time into the hopper while it is running. If it times out it while doing this, the beans jam it up again and I have to clean the beans out and start again. I am fairly OCD about my 1 mug of pour-over coffee a day, so I'll do this until I find a replacement. I thought this was a very nice grinder at relatively reasonable price. I really liked the glass receptacle with silicone lid to keep grounds from flying everywhere, but 16 months seems like a really short life span since this wasn't used a lot.

            "reviewDate": "August 13, 2016",
            "reviewText": "I have had several coffee grinders. Most, more expensive than the Bodum. Only the conical burr grinders, like this Bodum, do a good job of grinding. I have worn out two other burr grinders and decided to try a less expensive grinder. I am very happy with the Bodum grinder. I use the finest grind setting for making espressos, using dark roast beans. The grind is uniform and not dusty or clumped. It packs well in the portafilter and after extraction, the puck is easily tapped out of the portafilter on the lip of my trash can. The container which catches the ground coffee is glass with a rubber grip and a flexible plastic top. The top is slightly convex (pointing up to the grind delivery opening), so it contacts the opening through which the ground coffee is delivered. This keeps the ground coffee from getting away. I have not seen any significant static generated. The hopper is fairly small compared to previous grinders I have had (Breville Smart grinder and Baratza Encore) but is adequate for a few days of making two 20 ounce quad lattes each morning and sometimes an extra 12 ounce double midday. The grinder is fairly quiet; probably quieter than my previous grinders. It is small enough to keep out of the way on the back of the counter. To grind an amount of coffee, you just set the timer (up to 20 seconds) and press the start button. A 20 second grind produces enough for about one 20 oz. quad latte. There are suggestions inside the hopper cover for the amount of grind and time needed for different grind sizes. If you need to interrupt the grinding, just press the start button again. The grinder also has a power switch on the side, so you can shut it off completely with that. Coarseness of the grind is controlled by rotating the hopper to the size grind you want. Rotate only while the grinder is running. This is not a commercial grinder, so Bodum recommends grinding for not more than 20 seconds every 5 minutes to allow the motor to cool between grinds. This grinder is certainly adequate for home use (at least my home). The grinder is easy to disassemble for cleaning (although I haven't had to clean it yet)."

The quality of the copper (and aluminum presumably) is fantastic. The grind settings are consistent, the burrs are sharp, the speed is great. It's honestly not even that loud (it might wake up a baby in the next room, but not on the other side of the house... ask me how I know :/ ). Also, the grind settings are not fixed, it is basically infinitely variable and I can confirm it is great for as fine as for an aero press (just short of espresso) up to a french press (very coarse). I don't have an espresso machine so I can't speak to that.\n\nI know a lot of folks get worked up about the main gears being hard plastic (and I mean like... ABS hard) but after months of use (and cleaning it between every few pounds of coffee) this thing is clean, smooth, and running like a champ. Also, it has a 2 year warranty, so people who complained about it breaking after 13 months... use the warranty--that's what it is there for.\n\nI would strongly recommend this grinder. You need to figure out what you do, but this is awesome."

            "reviewText": "\u00a0Original review posted 11-15-2013: I absolutely love this coffee grinder. It grinds uniformly every time regardless of the fineness/coarseness selected. It disassembles easily for cleaning and is relatively quiet, as far as electric grinders go. Every couple of weeks I run a tablespoon of dry, uncooked rice through it on the coarse setting to clean out any leftover grounds or oils. The glass receptacle creates little static, a little more during the winter when the air is dry but the coffee grounds don't fly out everywhere when removing the cup from the machine. I just tap the glass cup a couple of times on the counter before removing the lid to settle the grounds that may have stuck to the sides. It stores easily and leaves a small footprint. it has a handy cord wrap on the bottom of the base too. The start/stop feature is very useful, especially if you need to stop the machine mid-grind for any reason. I'm the only coffee drinker in my house so this is the perfect size for my needs which is 1 or 2 cups per day, though it will grind enough for an entire pot.\n\n1-7-2015 UPDATE:\nRecently I broke my glass grinds receptacle for this grinder. The glass was very thin and it didn't take much but a light tap on the counter to cause it to break. I went to the Bodum website to buy a replacement but they were out of stock. After giving this conundrum further thought, I decided to replace the cup with something more durable. This is what I came up with and it's working fabulously!\u00a0Tablecraft H159 Stainless Steel Dredge with Handle, 10-Ounce\u00a0It is slightly narrower than the original glass container so the silicone lid fits loosely. However, when you put it into the machine, it fits very snug, (height-wise), so there is no slipping or moving at all from vibrations during a grind cycle. Also and most importantly, there is VERY LITTLE TO NO STATIC! When I pull it out of the machine there are no messy grounds flying around or on top of the lid. This stainless steel shaker cup (dredge) is also available without the handle but since it's such a snug fit in the machine, I think the handle serves a purpose in being able to remove it easily. There are many other brands/prices of stainless steel dredges on amazon that would also work, provided they are the right size. I found mine at target ($5.79). FYI: If you break your glass container, hang on to your silicone lid. The Bodum website does not sell replacements for it. (I misspoke in the video.) In fact, the ONLY replacement part you can buy for the entire grinder is the glass container, (w/o the lid). Hope this info helps if you've broken your glass grinds cup."

I shopped for a grinder that could do a good job without spending big bucks. I didn't think that would be possible until I tried this grinder. I can produce a beautiful shot of espresso, rich with crema. I'm very happy with this machine.\n\nONE MONTH LATER\nAfter about 20 espresso grinds, the grinder was almost completely plugged. I was using Starbucks Decaf Espresso. I emailed the maker and they advised me to clean the machine after every use. Really?? I clean my La Pavoni about once a year and that's just because I think I should. It never plugs and works flawlessly even though it's probably 15 years old.\n\nMY ADVICE:\nIf you want to grind for your espresso maker, spend a few more dollars for a better machine."

The glass receiver is a nice touch and much prefered over plastic that comes with allmost every other grinder, it dosnt totaly eliminate static but its very minimal just a lil bit of powder along the sides of the glass which is easily tapped down but deff no powder flying around or flying out of the jar making a mess so u dont have to worry about that like with some other grinders u have powder flying out of the receiver theres so much static not with this one the jar is desighned pretty good i must say and has a rubber top that helps just handle the jar with care and dont drop because it will break its not super thick glass. Nice length cord and underneath the machine has a system to keep it wrapped nicely so ur able to just let out the exact amount of cord you need. Now my biggest complaint is the base of the grinder could of been designed better it is not very sturdy or solid and tends to wiggle if you move the unit with your hands which isnt a huge deal because it just sits on the counter and its not like it moves while its grinding or anything just when ur physically handling it which makes it feel kind of umm cheap maby is the word or just not very solid especially if the cord isnt placed in the slot thats carved out for it to run threw and the machind ends up sitting on the cord then its very wobbly so with that said the base could of been designed better maby with wider pegs for it to stand on. All in all im very happy for the price with this unit an would highly recommend i give it 4.5 stars!"

I got the Aluminum model and it feels way more solid than the rubberized ones, and looks great sitting next to my original Bonavita coffee maker. I was torn between this Bodum and the comparable Capresso, but in the end I just thought the Capresso looked ugly ;) I realize this Bodum has plastic gears that a lot of reviewers complain about, but just by the Asurion 4-year protection plan. For $4 you can get a brand new Bodum at no cost if those gears break out of warranty (or buy something else if you want). I didn't let that one issue dissuade me from choosing what I think is the best looking mid-priced grinder on the market.\n\nFunctionally I find the grinder to work every bit as good as my hand-cranked Hario Skerton. I bought it to use primarily with a french press, and the coarser grind settings were perfect. It's also incredibly fast. I keep it on the 10 second setting and it gives me the perfect amount of grind to use for a full french press. I like the glass carafe - while there is some amount of static cling it's nothing that a few seconds of cleaning can't handle. The carafe feels solid and compliments what is already a beautiful appliance.\n\nIf you're on the fence between this and the comparably priced Capresso or Baratza units, don't over think it. All are great grinders, and it really comes down to the visual aesthetic you prefer. For me it was easily this Bodum and I'm happy with the choice."

When it worked it only too about 30 secs to grind the beans and, although I used it every day, 7 days/wk, I wouldn't say that 30 secs of grinding time is that much to expect from the product.\n\nNo point trying to get my $ back from Amazon or fixed by Bodum. Although burr ground coffee is \"better,\" I think I'll just stick w/my blade style grinder from now on.\n\nOh well . . . lesson learned. Sometimes simpler and cheaper is just better."

Occasionally, the cap came off, and made a huge mess. Purchased in Jan 2017. Unit failed on 12/31/2017. I typically ground about 12 oz every three weeks. 20 sec/grind, finest setting. During grinding I heard a pop, and the grinding rate slowed down significantly. I emptied the bin, shook the unit then proceeded to grind. However, grinding rate was still very low. After the hopper was empty, I could still hear a rattling noise inside. Upon disassembly of the unit, I found a tiny bearing had come out. I conclude that this tiny single bearing is held in place by a spring. The spring failed, and let the bearing come out. That is what affected the grinding rate. For $100 I expected this unit to last 5-7 years, not 11 months. Additionally, the unit is very hard to clean. I had to purchased compressed air cans to clean it out. After disassembly coffee grounds were scattered all over the electronics and trapped under the grinding blade. Trapped coffee gets stale and affects the flavor of fresh coffee beans. So over time, I would expect coffee to taste worse."

We use it daily (sometimes more) for the last 5 years to make pour over coffee with a Chemex. I also bought the matching white electric kettle and they look cute as heck sitting on the counter together.\n\nThere is one glaring problem, though: Unlike the kettle, which has a smooth, albeit cheaper-feeling, plastic finish, the grinder has a rubber-like surface. It feels sticky to the touch, and basically acts as a coffee grounds magnet. Since ours is white, it looks eternally dirty. I've tried damp clothes, light soap, even bleach sprays - and it never looks clean.\n\nI still have to give it 4 stars because it's really an excellent grinder and it's pretty to boot. If, however, you are borderline OCD when it comes to kitchen cleanliness, then consider looking for another grinder. Or perhaps getting the stainless or copper option."

I purposely sought out a grinder with a GLASS jar because of so many reviews for different grinders with plastic catch jars being horribly messy.

This Bodum takes FIVE SECONDS to grind my two Tb of coffee perfectly (I did a coarse grind; haven't tried anything finer). And, I like that I can store beans in the top for a few cups and not have to do THAT every day (how lazy can one get?!). But -- we like what we like.

Recently the coffee consumption in my house has increased it was no longer efficient to grind the beans by hand. Before purchasing I had a few questions that I was not able to find find an answer for here on Amazon so I thought I'd provide a few of those for those who find themselves asking the same thing.\nThe first, how consistent is the grind? Like many machines, the finer the grind the more consistent. See pictures for an example. My second question, what's the range of the granular grinds themselves? Again see pictures. Based on my brewing methods of choice (drip, Chemex, V60, Aeropress) the grinds provided are excellent!"

Grinding a lot of coffee beans would take a long time given the warning to let it cool. The guide embedded in the cover for quantities would only hold true for a very weak brew. It is not realistic. Also, the resevoir for holding the beans is small.\nThis is less a problem for me as I rarely grind for more than 2 cups anyway. If you bear these limitations in mind this is a good grinder.\nUPDATE: Worked fine for 10 months until it didn't.

I had done enough research to realize a burr grinder was key in making decent espresso. However, as a student, budget constraints prevented me from spending much more than $100. I bought this burr grinder based on reviews and my brand familiarity with Bodum.\nI have used this grinder for 2 weeks. I am very satisfied with the grind I get on the espresso setting on this burr grinder; the freshly ground beans feel like sand which is exactly what I've read is the desired grind for espresso. The grind produced seems to be composed of consistently sized particles with very little variation in particle size (no noticeably large hunks of beans and not a lot of powdery grind). I haven't had any issues with the timed grind (20 second maximum) that other reviewers have mentioned in a negative light. I grind my beans immediately before I make my morning latte. The small quantity of beans required for my double shot only takes the grinder about 10 seconds to grind. On weekends, I can grind enough beans in 20 seconds to make myself and my boyfriend a latte each.\nI absolutely love that the ground coffee container (where the ground beans land) is glass. As I was wandering throughout the burr grinder selection online, it was disappointing to see the number of burr grinders that used plastics for this particular container. This Bodum stood out to me because of the use of glass in its design.\nThis grinder is noisy, but as I am usually the last one out of bed, it hasn't been an issue in my household. I have not had any complaints from apartment neighbors either. I'm not sure how many burr grinders are quiet. It seems to me, the grinding of any material = noise.\nI will try to update this review over the years to share longevity of this burr grinder."

That was the second C*******t we have worn out, the bearings in the motors gave up with screaming sound effects. The C*******t also had all the \"features\" we did NOT like: a VERY static electricity prone hopper, which \"helped\" distribute the ground coffee all over the kitchen. A sound volume that almost required hearing protection. It was impossible to clean properly... also, the grinding mechanism is disk/burr, and it tended to overheat the beans - being oily French roast, things got stuck and tasted awful on occasion.\n\nBack to our new grinder:\nLooking high and low for a new one, most grinders that \"seemed OK\" and had good ratings were in the multi-hundred-dollar price range. Clearly not for me.\nFound this at the last minute, before I ordered a C******o. Why did I not know about Bodum's coffee grinder before? I know their coffee presses and glass-ware... but did not know they made grinders.\nThis grinder exceeds all our expectations of a coffee grinder, and it is stylish as well!\n\nIt just does everything right, I think:\nIt really is a conical burr grinder!\nThe grinder runs slow, so not to heat the ground coffee.\nIt has a glass hopper that is not prone to static electricity - at least not in any significant way. The hopper can be emptied straight into the filter without beans flying all over. That alone makes me happy.\nThe hopper seals well to the body of the grinder so no ground coffee escapes.\nIt comes apart easily for access to the grinding mechanism - it can be cleaned! Without resorting to tooth-picks, Q-tips and compressed air.\nIt is quiet - for a grinder.\nStylish - we got the red grinder. Color splash on the counter! Why is everything else black/white/stainless?\n\nGetting to the coffee - how did the coffee taste? We set it for the recommended size for a drip/paper filter brew. The beans we use are very oily, being a French roast, but they came out beautifully, no \"gooping\" up of the grinder.\nFirst brew: we think the coffee tastes superior to what we have been used to: more coffee flavor and less bitter. Guessing that the large conical burr mechanism treats the beans much better than the disk/burr grinder did.\n\nWould I recommend this? Absolutely! Price point? Excellent value.\nI have attached some pictures to show the conical burr grinder mechanism.\nHave to stop writing now and get a refill of coffee!"

I have had this Bodum model for over 5 years now (purchased in December 2011), and it is still going strong. For that reason I will purchase it again. I do not use it regularly - in fact, over the past couple of years it has really only been used once or twice a week since I have been doing large batches of cold brewed coffee - but when I do use it, the motor is running for the full 20 seconds so that I can get a good full cup of coarse ground coffee. I have probably cleaned the unit just two or three times over the years...so I don't really baby it either.\n\nAfter considering some alternatives, the thing I like most about this unit is that it has a large coffee hopper (12 oz. versus the typical 8 oz.), easily allows you to set a wide range of grind consistency and has a separate dial for the grind time (0-20 seconds) so you can just push a button and let it grind out a consistent and predictable amount of coffee each time, and it has the nice glass container that holds the grounds versus the typical plastic ones. I also liked that I paid $80 for this in 2011 and now it is only $72...not sure if that is timing or if the price has decreased a bit over the years.\n\nI will be going back to what has worked for me in the past - the Bodum Bistro grinder."

I settled on a $10 manual grinder because 1) I only drink espressos on the weekend and manually grinding didn't sound that time consuming. 2) I wasn't convinced any other grinders were worth the price because so many have a heap of bad reviews.\n\nNeedless to say, I got tired of manually grinding my beans after about 5 occasions. Specifically, the last time when I made a double-shot espresso for myself and someone else. Then, yes, quite time consuming.\n\nI went back to the drawing board and, after coming across the Bodum Bistro several times pre- and post-manual grinder, I decided on this grinder simply because I feel I know what to expect from it. It's clearly an amazing and well-loved appliance until the plastic gears inside break. For that reason, I also purchased the 4-year warranty for $5.54 which has a $0 deductible. Bodum provides a limited one year warranty on manufacturer defects so the SquareTrade 4-year warranty covers the 3 years (yes, 3) after that. The most important factor with warranties (to me) is whether or not it will cover shipping costs. The SquareTrade warranty does provide prepaid shipping labels although you are responsible for packaging it (safely) yourself. Hence why I'm opting to hold onto the original box until the warranty's up.\n\nAnother big reason I chose the Bodum Bistro is because of the glass container that catches the coffee. I read many reviews about plastic containers causing a ton of static electricity and therefore causing coffee grounds to jump all over and make a mess. I really didn't want to deal with this so glass was a requirement.\n\nI used the grinder for the first time this morning and, boy, it works fast. It's not too loud. I'm not sure how quiet you expect a grinder of any sort to be but, in the wee hours of the morning, it certainly wasn't startling. Although, I imagine it's loud enough to wake someone up. I wasn't sure how long to grind for 2 shots of espresso so I opted to start with a 5 second grind.. Not enough. 10 second grind.. Getting closer. 10 second grind.. too much! 20 seconds seems to be the winner for 2 shots.\n\nI'm very happy with my purchase and hope I never have to utilize those warranties!"

I use a multitude of methods of brewing: pour-over, press pot, cold brew, and an auto-drip (Bonavita).\n\nSo, that being said, I know I should have invested in a nice grinder, like $400+. I get a lot of feedback at grinders from coffee shops and this one shouldn't cut it. But it does! It's consistent and that's what counts. I have a hand-crank coffee grinder too which might be better, but I don't want to crank out coffee every morning. This is quick and easy. The timer makes it nice for ease, but you can always weigh your beans and run them through then turn it off.\n\nSometimes the start/stop button doesn't work and I have to press it again. There's always the switch on the side though. I had a friend who burned out the motor on one of these by letting it spin for too long. So I am aware of that and I don't let it go for too long. I usually only make 1-2 cups at a time anyways.\n\nSo, pros: small/compact design. Different colors to choose from. Big hopper if that's your jam. Glass container w/lid. Master on/off switch. Timer. Wide range of grind settings.\n\nCons: My start/stop button sometimes sticks. That's it. This grinder is awesome."

Others posting here have mentioned that Bodum does have replacement glass containers but not the rubber lids. I don\u2019t know how they found this out but I have not been able to reach anyone with the company to find out if they actually do have the replacement cup or how much it costs. Well I broke ours this morning and not wanting to buy a whole new grinder for that simple part I started looking around and found that the yellow Rubbermaid cups that were provided in the 50# bags of Purina Dog Chow 30 years ago fit perfectly. (See pictures) I love these old cups and recently bought several more on eBay for what I would guess to be a lot les than Bodum charges for their glass cups. The advantage to the glass though, is that a gentle tap on the bottom of the glass while emptying into the coffee filter loosens nearly all of the fresh coffee grounds. We\u2019ll see now, if the static cling of the dry coffee grounds keeps the plastic cup from being a capable replacement. If the company would simply make replacement parts available I would give it 5 stars plus, but the lack of parts and a decent website makes it a 4 star item. ...... Sorry Bodum."

It is not a solid seal as if it were put in a closed container, but the silicone lid is raised in the middle butting it up against the grinder opening. So, the closure occurs between the hopper lid and the grinder lid. Not bad if you grind daily.\nI always put the coffee back in the bag and put it in a sealed container. I only grind the beans when its ready. And MMMMMMMM it's delicious.\nThe glass container has much less static than the plastic containers I've used.\n- TIP: Hold the container with your dominant hand, and with the palm of your other hand, cover the lid opening and shake in a stirring motion. It doesn't need to be done hard, the swirling of the grinds take any possible static-charged coffee off the walls. The glass will not retain a charge so any cling is minimal and short-lived.\nAlso, Clean it after so many uses, the powdery grinds cake up and will be super hard to remove later.

I'm so glad I was able to fix that power switch!\n\nThe good news is that Amazon Customer Service is second to none and the replacement that arrived 2 days later seems solid. For the price and the years of service I've gotten, I still give this grinder 5 stars.\n\nOriginal Review:\n\nI just bought this grinder to replace the same model that has served me well for 5 years and a couple of months.\n\nThey look almost identical, but there are obviously some underlying differences. After running a cup of uncooked rice through the grinder and cleaning everything well, I roasted about 200 grams of beans to a full city roast and eagerly tried it out.\n\nThe first thing I noticed is that it seems quieter. It has a lower pitched growl as opposed to a high pitch whine like the old one, and sounds more solid.\n\nWith the old grinder, I could reliably grind for 17 seconds and get 45 grams of ground coffee, plus or minus a gram or two depending on the coffee. Running this grinder for 17 seconds gave 64 grams of coffee. Setting the grind level between the first and second dot after the French press symbol gave a consistent, good-size grind for a pot of pour over coffee.\n\nIf this grinder lasts as long as the last one I had, I will consider it a fantastic buy!"

It did a good job, but the covering got dirty easy-I got the red one and the plastic seemed to absorb a lot of the coffee so a cleaning was needed and not a wipe down like other small kitchen appliances. When it broke, my son and his girlfriend got me a Mr.Coffee and that was a piece of junk compared to this. In fact I got that coffee grinder for Christmas of 2016 and now that one's broken. They don't make products as good as they once did. but charge high prices like its a high quality item. The amount of money you have to fork out-and the life time of this being less than 4 years, doesn't make it a good buy. Maybe if they reduce the price by 40-50 bucks than it would be worth it."

I have grounds stick to the inside of the glass jar, to the outside of the jar, and to the plastic area where the jar sits, as grounds still in the grinding chamber are jostled loose when removing or inserting the jar. Granted, these are consistently-sized, flavorful grounds the the machine did a fine job of creating, but they still stick and create a bit of a mess. The only other issue I have is that the grinder has a 20-second limit for grinding time with a 5-minute wait between grind attempts. I use a heaping 1/2 cup of beans to make a pot of coffee and grind to a relatively fine texture (the second dot from the finest grind choice), It takes two cycles - 20 seconds, plus 5 minutes, plus 20 seconds - to grind the 1/2 cup of coffee beans. That's a little slower than I would care for, not to mention having escaped grounds in the area that need to be cleaned up.\n\nOverall it's not bad, but I can't say I have noticed any flavor benefit in a pot of coffee after upgrading from the blade grinder I used previously. It does do a very nice, fine grind for when I use my Aeropress, though."

First of all with all those reviews no one mentioned you can only grind enough beans to make a half a pot of coffee. If you want a full pot you have to wait 5 minutes and do another 20 second grind. I can only characterize this thing as a joke ! One of the main reasons you spend money on a conical burr grinder is supposed to be to limit the powder. Powder results in bitter coffee when used in a drip coffeemaker .This thing produce so much powder on the medium setting it ruined the entire pot. My $18 Braun blade grinder does not produce anywhere near the powder that this thing produces! Furthermore, the glass cup that is supposed to reduce static was about the worst possible. After one grind the entire inside was coated with fine powder. I was also attracted to the comments about \" easy to clean \" . This thing is a nightmare to clean. Only the top of the grinder comes off. The bottom half is attached to the motor. After one grind it took me 20 minutes to clean. The powder just kept coming and coming out ! I even took it down to my shop and blew compressed air through the top. My whole shop is now covered in coffee powder ! . I sent it back after the first use !"

There are grounds falling out of the machine when I take the cup out, grounds falling off of the lid, cup, etc. Its just everywhere. Despite what the manufacturer says, the cup does very little, if anything about the static cling. Lastly, this machine makes a ton of noise.

It has gotten to the point where I have to clean it every day. About a teaspoon of grounds stay in the upper part, and I have to shake the grinder as they fall out and make a mess. So, Yes, I love this coffee grinder, but for those of you thinking about buying it, be aware you really do need to clean it once a week at first. One of the people in the answers section has really good advice for cleaning it with rice. Read it. I follow his directions once a week. Also, after I grind coffee, and I put the contents of the little jar into my filter, grounds continue to leak out, making a bit of a mess. I have learned to tap the machine to get more of the grounds out, but there are always more. I do think the cleaning procedure is worth the delicious coffee you will get with grinding it yourself. But be sure to store the grounds in one of those air-sealed type canisters. I got the friis one on Amazon and it works really well, but once more, it takes some work. You have to change the filter once every two months. At any rate, you have to decide if it is worth the work."

I did not notice the on/off switch. I called the 800 number on the manual. A recording said if anyone in our household was over 50 they had a special offer. I pressed one and got a hard sell woman trying to get me to accept a medical alert device. I said I was not interested, she kept selling, I asked to be transferred back to Bodum, she said she could not do that. Hung up and called again. Now a different product was being pitched, but no way to talk to Bodum customer service. A ridiculous joke. I found an online chat for Bodum, sent my question. They responded by telling me that any problem I had needed to go back to the retailer. I gave up. And THEN they sent me an email asking me how I would rate their customer service!!\n\nI have never had a coffee grinder I had to turn off after using. Can\u2019t it turn itself off when the grind is complete? I do like the styling and the glass carafe. When this baby grinds itself to death, we won\u2019t be buying another one."

It is much better than the Cuisinart ever thought of being. I was always a bit ticked at the inconsistent grind with the Cuisinart. This one grinds a consistent grind every time. It has a glass container for collecting the ground coffee which really reduces the electrostatically charged grounds flying all over the kitchen counter as they do with a plastic container.

About as loud as you'd expect of an electric burr grinder. I'm not a huge fan of the timer-based grind, as I had gotten used to weighing out my beans before the grind. However, if you're less concerned about precision and more concerned about not having to hold down a grind button, it works out all right.\n\nTHE BUILD: The build of the grinder feels a little cheap-plasticky. It also has a fairly narrow base, so attempting to handle it will make it teeter a bit. The large hopper if you don't want to go through the effort of pouring out beans for every coffee. Personally, I would have preferred a smaller hopper to grind out individual servings, but that's a mea culpa on my part.\n\nADD'L THOUGHTS: I'm not the biggest fan of the grind-bin's design. There's a rubber thingy that goes on top to prevent grinds from getting all over the place. However it's really just an annoying extra step of the grind process to try to get grinds stuck to the rubber thingy to drop down into the glass bin. I'd also recommend washing the glass bin before you use it, as there seems to be some coating out of the box that makes grounds more likely to stick to the walls of the bin. As with most electric grinders, you will want to give the grinder a few solid taps after a grind to get stubborn grounds to drop into the bin.\n\nOVERALL: It grinds coffee."

The look is fun (we got the chrome), but I can't say enough about the round glass canister! It feels cleaner, has no static buildup, the grounds dump or scoop right out and because it is so perfectly shaped, it's as easy to clean as a drinking glass. So I often wash it right after use even though there is no buildup, just a few crumbs. By the way, you can order replacement glass canisters directly from the manufacturer, so no worries if you break one, just save your lid. In fact, I plan to order an extra anyway, would be nice if you were grinding two types of coffee. It is very quiet compared to our old one. The second timer vs. a grinder that grinds by cups, takes a little trial and error, but suggested amounts are on the lid of the grinder. Worst case you grind a little too much and you just save what you don't use in the glass canister until later. Instead of dumping it into my coffee maker, I now use a scoop to measure it after grinding to get the precise amount. Now for the best part, the coffee tastes amazing! No chalky taste, just depth from the bean and a smooth finish. I wouldn't normally spend this much on a grinder, but it sure made a difference and knowing how many coffee's I dumped out and then went to get out, I think it will save in the long run...a lot!"

I tried another noted brand of burr-type coffee grinder and had to send it back within days because of the mess it made with coffee dust. It made so much static electricity in its operation that the product was unusable. The ground coffee container was plastic and when you tried to remove it from the machine and remove the lid, coffee dust first would jump out all over the place, while lots remained sticking to the underside of the lid and was hard to remove without falling all over the place. Then when you tried to remove the ground coffee from the container, static would cause the ground coffee to spray around instead of falling into a coffee filter. Because ground coffee would adhere to the side and bottom of the container, it was next to impossible to empty completely without getting the ground coffee all over everything. When I checked online to see if others experienced this same problem, I found many such reports, with a like number of proposed \"solutions.\" When I tried a few, I found that none of them solved the problem. So, I returned the unit to the supplier for a full refund, did a lot more research on the Internet, found the Bodum got high marks, ordered it, and have been enjoying it and the ground coffee it produces. A small amount of ground coffee still adheres to the inside walls of the ground coffee container, but a few taps of your hand or on the counter causes that to fall to the bottom of the container."

The timer mechanism is electronic and worth eliminating, I took it apart twice and tried to fix that - not possible. If you want this to be bombproof., look for the same model without the timer - or cups of coffee selector function. Simple on/off switching. Simple is best says the engineer in me."

The conical grinder and glass grounds container were enough of an incentive for me to give this grinder a try.\n\nI've been using this grinder 3x a day for nearly a month now and love it. It does a uniform job of grinding for a press pot, with a continuous scale to very fine. They warn not to change the grind unless the grinder is in operation or the beans have been emptied. That seems a small price to pay for its being priced for the home market. The amount of beans ground is controlled by a timer. It is comparatively loud, but is over with faster than anything I've had before."

I have had the grinding gear clog once with very oily beans and it was easy to open and clear it out. The only issue for me is that sometimes when removing the glass coffee container some of the ground beans will fall onto the counter.

No seal. Don't plan to store your beans there long.\n- The rubber top of the grind receptacle is decent, but coffee dust & chaff still manage to get everywhere.\n- Grind consistency has faded over time.\n- I have the plastic red/black unit, which is starting look and feel cheap sitting on out my kitchen counter.\n\nOther notes:\n- This grinder really hit a wall when I started to make cold brew at home. It takes 4-5 repetitions of grind, empty, grind, empty to get the 240g of coarse grinds I need for my cold brew set up.\n- Occasionally, and for no apparent reason, I am only able to grind for a very short time - like 1/2 a second. So I have to keep pressing the button to get the amount of grinds I need. Could be an isolated event, but this and the need for a bigger grinder are what spurred me on to write a review and seek out a new grinder.\n\nIn summary, 5 years of pretty regular use and this $95 burr grinder has lost some of its edge. Its still a great burr grinder and it outperforms many other units. Then again, you do pay for the quality which (for me) has faded over time."

Not sure what it was but after that one incident, it's been working without a hiccup. I got a little worried when that happened on the first grind but hopefully it was a one time occurrence.\n\nI've read about concerns over the durability so I'll be keeping a close eye on this unit and the warranty.\n\nAside from that, the grind is great and it makes less mess than my previous grinder. The beans feed nicely from the hopper. The receiver and lid are designed well to reduce mess. I do give it a little tap with my finger to dislodge any grinds in the chute before I remove it from the machine.\n\nOverall, a great grinder for the price point. Hopefully it lasts a long time.\n\nSound level is much quieter than my last grinder too (but keep in mind, these machines are an unavoidably loud appliance). You would hear it in a near bedroom but could probably get away without waking a housemate sleeping further from the kitchen."

Grounds are deposited neatly into the glass jar and the rubber lid/seal make it so that there's no spillage or mess. The settings and adjustments on this grinder are simple and straightforward to use and the grind settings allow you to have the flexibility to prepare a variety of types of coffee from espresso to french press.

Combined with an Aeropress, I don't even need to add milk any more, each cup is just that good.\n\nI love that I can leave it off until I need it, not wasting power. It's easy to add just the amount needed for 2 cups, grind only that (timer set to 20 secs but I turn it off manually) and walk away, which has me free to switch flavours daily.\n\nBottom line? There may be bigger fancier brands, but this works beautifully and I don't need more.

By the way, I own two of these machines: one at a house near the ocean which never has a static problem as the air is so moist. But here in my dry, dry, dry apartment, the static issue was making a mess of my counter. The simple solution I read about that works for me is this: after grinding the beans remove the plastic cover from the glass container and take a stainless steel (don't know if composition of the spoon makes any difference so you silver spoon people carry on) and stir the grounds for a minute or so. This seems to diminish the static tremendously. Works for me anyhow! Good luck with your grinders. I think it's a fine little machine at a good price."

Messy! Also, the flimsy lid does not fit tightly on the needlessly broad top, which wouldn't be a problem if I didn't store beans in the grinder. Yes, I know Bodum says not to do that. But let's get real: lots of us can't be bothered emptying unground beans out each time, plus, if Bodum didn't want us to store beans there, why did they make the hopper so big? Especially considering the timer maxes out below one pot's worth. And why, by the way, is this grinder such a wimp that it can't go to 30 seconds in one pass? The ground coffee is okay, but I don't think I'd buy this design again.\n\n* I live in the Arizona desert, so static might not be such a problem in more-humid areas.

One grinds for French Press, the other for aeropress through a stainless filter, and I grind for aeropress through a paper filter. All of us use different size grind settings and have no problems.

            "reviewText": "After using this coffee grinder for almost a year, I give it a solid 5-star rating. Although it's nowhere near professional quality, I don't believe you will find a better grinder for the price. I tried two or three other brands (sorry, don't remember them) but sent them right back because of either inability to grind accurately, or just plain poor workmanship.\n\nI've found that the Bodum Bistro is quite good at achieving the desired grind size (I use mostly coarse, for a French press pot). It's easy to clean, too.\n\nTwo caveats:\n1. Be careful storing the unit, as the carafe can easily slide out of its receptacle if you tilt the unit. I rubber band the carafe in place to keep it from falling out when storing on the shelf.\n2. This grinder, like all the rest, creates a lot of static electricity, so even with the glass carafe, the grinds tend to fly all over the place when you're emptying the carafe. I do my transfers inside the sink after grinding, so the mess is contained and easily rinse-able."

We shall see about durability, but the five star rating is for how silently it operates and how consistently it grinds at all settings. I used to own the cuisinart grinder which lasted me 10 years and was still going. The bodum is much quieter and more consistent in comparison. It\u2019s glass canister is also much more useful since it doesn\u2019t have coffee cling to it by static, and since it is round and its diameter is less than my 1 liter French press, it is a simple as dumping the ground coffee in the press effortlessly. I love this for the moment. I hope it will hold up as well as the cuisinart has."

I also have an inexpensive Expresso machine (the Cuisinart). I have had no problems getting the grind size I want. I felt like the Expresso grind was good enough too. Though I am no expresso expert.\n\nI typically measure 23g of beans and grind for a little over 10-12 seconds. One feature I really like is that the \"time\" knob does not move. Ie. unlike some, it is not a spring loaded timer, it is a set and it stays design. I like it (though it could be a little tighter).\n\nThis is a \"geared down\" grinder, which I like. It means the grinding burrs are not spinning too fast, and therefore not heating up my coffee. It is a true conical burr, not a flat burr like most grinders in this price range. Its noisy, and I imagine there is not good way around it. But its not too bad and I can grind 23g of coffee in about 10 seconds.\n\nI like the glass grinds container. It is still a little staticy, but better that all plastic would be."

            "reviewText": "This replaced a Krups model that made a horrible racket, walked all over the counter when running, and collected gooey coffee dust in the corners of the plastic output bin. This model is quieter (though far from silent), stays put when running, and has a glass output jar that dispenses the ground coffee cleanly without residue. The input bin is air sealed (not very tightly, but adequately for small amounts) and holds enough beans for maybe a week or so. I have it set on fine for espresso grind for my Aeropress, and this gives entirely satisfactory results. The grind is cool and consistent, and the timer (I have it set on 10 seconds) is accurate and repeats reliably. I have ground three batches in a row a couple of times without the motor getting warm or showing other signs of straining. The only negatives are very minor. (1) The on-off switch on the side is unnecessary. Actual start/stop operation is with the red push button on the top of the body. (2) There is no safety switch to ensure that the output jar is in place when grinding. Made this mistake once. (3) A tiny bit of grind will fall after the output jar is removed, and will have to be blown or brushed off once a week or so. Giving the machine a brisk tap before removing the output jar will minimize this. All in all, a very good household coffee grinder for the price. This has earned a permanent place in my kitchen."

Five weeks in (after the window of return expired), I had to disassemble it because coffee grounds were coming out of the bottom of the unit. Inside, it was a mess. Coffee grounds all over the electronics.\n\nBottom line is that t's absolutely a faulty design; the grounds go down a multi-part plastic chute to a flat area above the glass receptacle. The chute can come apart, causing grounds to fall into the unit. Grounds that make it past this problem are deposited into a flat area that has a hole in the center. What ends up happening is, the coffee grounds build up over time and -- every time you move the unit -- spill everywhere. It's a mess.\n\nWe bought this product based on all the 5-star reviews. Now I'm pretty convinced they were Vine reviewers or 5-star reviews paid for by Bodum. There's just no way a design this faulty could result in satisfied buyers of this machine."

While it worked, it served as seemingly cost efficient way to produce an excellent grind for a higher-end Italian Espresso machine.\n\nAll a long I knew that I probably needed a durable grinder that was at least in the $200 range, or more. And this was proven to be the case. So the day this one stopped working, I decided to buy another grinder. I bit the bullet (willingly) purchased a Breville Smart Grinder. I did not order it from Amazon, but purchased it from Sur La Table and paid the sales tax. Seems stupid, but actually the store provides a lifetime warranty; so for about $220 for the grinder I have a lifetime warranty to return the grinder for any reason. I found this to be important as this is the 3rd lower cost burr grinder that stopped working shortly after purchase (including Capresso and Cuisinart brands).\n\nThe Bodum Bistro was a great unit while it worked, but was just not durable enough."

Pros include the glass container for the coffee grounds (the Cuisinart's was plastic), and it is quieter. The Bodum has a \"timer\" function rather than being based on how many cups are being ground for, but the concept is pretty much the same. The Cuisinart seemed to be more ruggedly built. In comparison the Bodum seems a bit lightweight and has a less quality feel - but time will tell how long the Bodum will hold up. We liked our Cuisinart but just wanted to try something different. So far (about a month later), we're pleased!"

However several people had investigated modifications that would increase the fineness of the grind and based on their reports I decided to buy one and take the chance that a modification would work out.\nWhen the grinder arrived I took it out of the box and found that the conical burr was only finger-tight to the spindle and easy to remove. So I proceeded with the modification without even turning on the grinder. The change consisted of making a washer 0.032 inches thick that mounts over the spindle and up inside the burr. With the washer in place, the burr is elevated by 0.032\" above its normal position resulting in reduced clearance to the upper burr and finer grinds, especially at the finest setting.\nThe results we are getting with this grinder are spectacular. It produces fine, even grinds that function beautifully in our Gaggia Classic resulting in thick crema and great taste. We have been using the grinder daily for 5 months and it has not plugged up once. The overall construction of the grinder is of very high quality. We couldn't be happier with this product and have no complaints."

Basically it was unusable (and hopefully defective)! At the time (10/2012), Others were complaining about the short grind times so I think Bodum may have had an product issue. Since I see a lot more positive reviews here now maybe they fixed it (Although people still talk about the short grind time). My take is that Bodum built an underpowered unit which they knew would over heat easily. To keep users from burning it up they put in some kind of thermal protection. I think the 20sec time limit may not be enough to grind for a 10 cup drip. You may find that depending on your unit you may be grinding more then once. Having to walk away for 2-5minutes between grinds. (Note that finer grinds take longer and auto drip grid is already on the coarse side)\n\nSince I didn't have it long I still have a bunch of unknowns: coarse to fine settings (can it do french press to expresso?), grind consistency at each setting, cleaning (a stone, yes coffee sometimes has little stones in it, can jam the machine ... how do you get it out), if the motor is constantly stressed ... how long will it last\n\nMy take is that this grinder may be more of a frustration then it's worth. If your price constrained and only grind for a few cups at a time the Bodum may work for you.\nPro's: small, burr grinder, good looking\nCons: underpowered, may have to grind several times (taking 10+ minutes or more), unknowns listed above.\n\nMy rating if they fixed it to actually run for 20sec ... two stars ... (my defective unit gets 0 stars)\n\nP.S. I ended up with a\u00a0Breville BCG800XL Smart Grinder. Costs two to three times as much (depending on sales and such), has a much bigger motor (I wouldn't call it oversized ... i.e. I think a even bigger one would not be bad).

After grinding static *always* has grounds clinging to the underside of the lid (even if grinding only a few grams of beans for a single cup). Slide the bin out slowly and you can watch them hop out from the hole in the lid and up the front side of the grinder, and then on to the counter. Removing the bin also has grounds fall out from the grinding area above, no matter how much you try to tap on the unit before removal. Also have found that after just a single grind there are grounds and bean dust on the counter directly under the motor. What? How does *that* happen?!\n- The longest run time is 20 seconds. If you were maybe making a 10-cup pot of coffee, 20 seconds doesn't cover that volume. Directions indicate you need to wait 5 minutes between runs if you do a full 20 second grind. I've never seen a consumer motor in anything with such a pathetic duty cycle (blenders and mixers have no problem running longer periods with no cool-down in between). If you like to grind fresh immediately before brewing, this puts a huge crimp in morning routines.\n\nPros?\n- It's Bodum. That's about it.\n\nThe fact that it's Bodum should make all the cons non-existent but such just isn't the case. I'm incredibly disappointed with this, especially for the cost.

I bought it to replace my last grinder which finally burnt out after years of use. So, far this has been a fine little grinder (I've had it for a year and a half, paid $66.48).\nIt certainly grinds fine enough for espresso on range of beans. My wife is a regular drip coffee drinker and has no complaints either. I can not speak to the coarser grinds, like french press, because I never use them.\nThe only trick one needs to know with this machine is how to avoid the sneak attack grinds which jump out after you remove the collection container (container is glass, no static, very nice!). So, these grinds stay up in the housing and don't fall into the collection glass. But, once you remove the container, they pour out. It is less than a quarter teaspoon but still makes a little mess. So to avoid it, after the grinding stops, but before you grab the container, just tap on the side of the machine and the sneak attack grinds will fall into the container and everything is fine. No mess. No reason to complain. Just about every gadget has it's particular idiosyncrasy. The sneak attack is this one's, and it is easily remedied.\nOverall, this is a great little grinder. It gets used twice daily, once for espresso and once for drip. I'd buy it again.\n\nUPDATE:\nI bought this grinder in 2012. Now 5 years later, 2017, we still use it twice daily. I use it for espresso grind, my wife for percolator coffee. It still works great!\nI now need a second grinder for the office. So, I'm buying another Bodum."

It was quiet when I first bought it (which is the reason I bought this model) but recently it seems to be less quiet. I hesitate to grind the coffee when the rest of the family is asleep on the weekends because I don't want to wake them up. But that has only been true for about the last 6 months. For that reason, I'm wondering if a new one, which is half the price I paid in 2012, would be a good move. Assuming it's identical then yes it would be.\nOtherwise the quality of the coffee grinds is still excellent. It's still good, whether made in the Bonavita, or pour over in the Chemex. Love the glass receptacle - no static, never broken. So really, an excellent machine."

The reviews seemed solid, so we got it. We turned it to the finest setting, grind for 15 seconds, and it produces just enough grounds for two cups of espresso. It makes the finest grounds we've had from home! We previously used the HEB and other grocery store machines, but this produces the best, by far. I would say it's almost borderline Turkish fine. Some reviews suggested that the metal variants work better for them, so we got the copper. Absolutely no problems with static, fingerprints, or any other complaints so far. For some reason, it makes the coffee beans go longer; we have bought noticeably less coffee since we got this grinder. Also, we use it occasionally for French press, and it has no problem making coarse grounds."

            "reviewText": "I bought this grinder as a move up from the blade grinders which can deliver an inconsistent result and one not very precise for different brewing methods. I carefully considered the options, read the reviews, considered my price point, and decided on the Bodum. The white was available at about $10 less than the black and matched my other appliances, so I went with that one.\n\nPretty much everyone praises the uniform grind, etc. The cone is designed so that beans feed easily into the grinder. Unlike a Krups burr grinder I have used, I've had no occasion so far to have to shake the Bodum to move the beans from the storage cone into the grinder. The unit is relatively small. It could be even smaller if the cone weren't designed to hold beans for 30 cups of coffee. Folks serious about their coffee aren't apt to be storing beans for 30 cups at room temperature on the kitchen counter--well, maybe folks soooooo serious about their coffee that they're drinking huge quantities--but the rest of us could get by with a much smaller cone.\n\nThe 30-cup capacity cone is especially silly in a grinder that is supposed to be run for only 20 seconds at a time, max, with 5-minute intervals between grindings. Many of the reviews take note of this limitation: some dismiss it as largely irrelevant to their habits; at least one reviewer ignores this prescription entirely; others do find it to be an issue.\n\nAfter reading the reviews, I bought this grinder thinking that, for the relatively small quantities of coffee I brew--the equivalent of about 4-5 cups each morning--the 20-second rule probably wouldn't be an issue. There were few specifics in the reviews I read as to how much coffee you could grind in 20 seconds.\n\nAs it turns out, the 20-second rule is a minor inconvenience, even for my 4-5 cups each morning. If I'm brewing French press, 20 seconds will give me enough beans at the relatively coarse grind. If, however, I'm brewing drip, my five scoops of beans requires about 35 seconds.\n\nMy work-around--and it is a work-around--is to grind for 20 seconds at the drip setting, let the grinder rest for five minutes while I get the water ready and bring it to a boil. About the time the water is at a boil, I grind for another 15 seconds or so, and that gives me the amount of ground bean I need.\n\nAs for the much touted advantage of the glass (v plastic) receptacle for the grind, I'm not seeing it. I get pretty much the same amount of cling with the glass as I've experienced with the plastic receptacle on the Krups that I've used. My theory here is that it's not static cling that causes the grind to stick to the receptacle; it's the oils in the ground beans that sticks. If it were static cling, it stands to reason that the plastic might hold more of the grind, but the glass holds just as much of the sticky oil. OK, there may be a slight advantage to the glass, but it's not much in my estimation.\n\nWould I buy this product again? I'd certainly consider it at this price point, but I'd also have to look hard at other models, including the Krups at about the same price and the Cuisinart at a markedly lower price point."

I replaced a standard Cuisinart coffee grinder with a burr grinder to enjoy a better tasting coffee, and this grinder accomplishes this. I chose this medium-prized grinder over the more expensive Baratza Virtuoso grinder to save a few bucks, and I\u2019m starting to wonder whether \u201cbeing cheap\u201d was a mistake in this case.\n\nI use a French press, and although the Bodum offers a range of grind option, the coarsest setting is still finer than it should be for a French press. To make matters worse, when I have it on the coarse setting, I actually have to hold the top part in place or else the grinding vibration causes the top to shift counterclockwise and turn the grinder off because the top becomes loose.\n\nBodum markets the glass catcher as \u201creducing\u201d static that causes jumping coffee grounds . . . well, it still leaves a mess: you get static coffee flakes all over the plastic lid and bottom part of the grinder which can (and will) get messy as you remove the catcher and take off the lid to pour the coffee into your French press, for example.\n\nAlso, granted, just a nit: after four months, the on/off button still trips me up: you need to push it down, not up to get the on position . . . (as another reviewer pointed out: it\u2019s something that really could be easily fixed \"for export\").\n\nFinally, the timed grinding feature is nice, but it would be even nicer if they included some kind of instructions as to what setting amounts to how many cups (roughly). It was a trial and error for me to get it right.\n\nBottom line: it\u2019s OK; it\u2019s a value burr grinder; you get what you pay for. But I wouldn\u2019t recommend it to a friend, not without the above caveats, which have me knock off three stars. Personally, I now wish I had invested $100 more to get a \u201creal\u201d burr grinder \u2014 one where I don\u2019t have to hold the funnel in place on the coarse setting and where \u201ccoarse\u201d means \u201ccoarse.\u201d"

            "reviewText": "Coffee experts agree that for the very best tasting coffee we need good beans, good water, and a good grinder (beans should be ground right before preperation for the best freshness). The best grinders use conical burrs to do the grinding.\n\nThe pick of conical burr grinders under $100 is slim indeed. Since the product description on this one did not specify that its burrs were conical, I went with the Brevell first. It did the job, but was quite messy, so I tried the Bodum, which does turn out to have conical burrs. Here's the comparison:\n\nPros: The Bodum is much neater. It's description rings true--using a glass catcher for the grinds reduces static electricity and results is much cleaner usage. No grinder will be perfect, but this one is a huge improvement. The 8-oz bean holder is also an improvement. The seal is tight, so the beans remain fresh. It is convenient to add new beans far less often. So, for convenience, the Bodum is far superior to the Brevell. Also, it's about $30 cheaper.\n\nCons: Other reviews have mentioned the fineness of the grind. I prefer a corse grind, but mainly use an automatic drip maker. So, the coarsest setting is acceptable. If grinding for a French press, or similar preparation method that calls for coarser beans, some may be disappointed. The other issue is that I often have to hold the bean container, to keep the machine grinding. If I simply push the button it will often stop grinding within a couple of seconds. This is a minor inconvenience, at thie price, but one worth noting.\n\nBottom line: This is a great conical burr grinder for the price. Most people will be more than satisfied. Those who prefer French press or perculated coffee may find the grind too fine. If so, prepare to pay more, because I'd recommend skipping the next step up (the Brevell) since it is so messy and inconvient."

My guess is that the dark roasted beans were too oily, as I've read this can cause this type of issue. Other than that, medium roasts seem to grind without issue. Coffee is fresher and more flavorful when ground with the Bodum Bistro Electric Burr grinder right before brewing, though I have never owned another grinder to which to compare. It's the equivalent of using dried parsley flakes from your spice cabinet vs. chiffonading fresh parsley to top a homemade meal."

            "reviewText": "UPDATE:\nAfter 6-7 months of daily use (2 coffees a day), our beloved Bodum bit the dust. I am somewhat handy so I disassembled the machine as fully as possible and cleaned everything out with a wire brush. I re-assembled but it was still broken. The grinds were not coming out properly, usually 15 seconds would give us the amount of grinds needed for the aeropress but now 15 seconds was only producing 1/10th of what normally came out. Even after continuous grinding to fill the cup, it made horrible coffee. So I phoned customer service and despite me asking them if there was anything I could fix by myself, they would only send me a replacement machine. Thank god for the 2 year warranty! I gave them my information after that via an email and received a response back 3 days later. They asked a question about my address so I replied and didn't hear back for another 3-4 days, in which they needed something else. I replied again right away and didn't hear one word back after repeat emails to them for about 14 days. I was giving up but then it showed up in the mail right after.\nNot sure who sits on the other end of the inbox for them but a quick, \"We shipped it\" email would have made me a whole lot happier.\n\nSo although I was able to get a replacement unit (without sending the old one back) with relative ease, I am still giving this product a 3 star review. A $100 grinder should last longer than half of a year and I am worried the replacement unit will break like the first one. And since it only has a 2 year warranty, I might be out a hundred bucks, sooner than later.\n\nInitial Review:\nWe bought this grinder after returning from Hawaii with $140 of some of the world's best coffee. We have an espresso machine and also an Aeropress but no grinder! We had been just buying vacuum sealed espresso grind and while it usually made pretty good cafe americanos, it never really made a good Aeropress coffee.\nWhen we got the product in the mail in came in the world's biggest box and we thought it was going to look bigger than our Saeco in the kitchen. It wasn't that bad when we got it out but this guy is still pretty tall on our counter. A little bit taller than the toaster but I like the design and the rubber feel to it. The hopper cap seems like to barely clicks on when you cap it but it has never fell off during use. Also I always seem to find grinds under the glass grind bottle and I don't know how it gets under there!\nThe grinder does have a 20 second timer and then you're supposed to wait 5 minutes until it cools down before next use...we do our best to wait the full 5 minutes. For the Aeropress we need more than 20 seconds worth so we grind for 20sec and then for another 10sec. Still works perfectly fine. It is also very easy to adjust the grind. We have made consistently good coffee with the finest espresso grind and Aeropress coffee with a course/fine grind. And for all of you Aeropress lovers out there: We consistently grind on the 3rd last dot from the FINEST end.\nMy friend recommended we buy this after he bought his for a $1200 espresso machine and I would recommend this product to anybody who likes fresh coffee. This thing works perfect or an espresso machine, a french press or an Aeropress. Just don't get the green color!"

This makes for a good dark, STRONG double shot, unlike any that I had pulled before from my Saeco Aroma.\nMy previous grinder was a B&D burr grinder. To be honest, I saw no difference between that one and any of the other (non-burr)grinders I have owned. Sure, it's nice to use freshly ground coffee, but even on it's finest setting, the grain of the grind was on a par with what you would get from a can of Maxwell House. The Bodium will grind as fine as dust. And speaking of dust, it is completely dust free, as in sealed. Unlike the B&D, there is no leakage to clean up.\n\nThe feed cup is large, and holds a good amount of beans. It seals as well with it's rubber top as any can top. Certainly better than a paper or foil coffee bag. You can fill the thing and your beans will stay as fresh as any other storage solution I can think of.\n\nAnother thoughtful feature is the rubber ring around the collecting jar which lets you easily pull the glass jar from it's seal, even with wet fingers. In my short experience with this grinder, the seal on the collecting jar is the work around for the admittedly limited duty cycle of the machine. It is enough of a seal to be dust free and enough of a seal to leave some coffee for your next use, without detectable degradation.\n\nMy only minor quibble is with the collecting jar's circular shape. The diameter is just a little too large to load a portafilter with a pour. You pretty much have to use a scoop. But, as I said, a minor quibble, and it would not be an issue with a larger target such as a Malita or drip machine.\n\nThe good:\nBrain dead, one touch ease of use, once you've dialed in your setting.\nConsistent ultra fine grind.\nReasonably quiet.\nSealed storage solution for beans.\nSealed glass collector with a convenient rubber grip.\n\nThe almost good:\nRequires use of a scoop for loading small targets such as a portafilter.\n\nThe not so good:\nThe machine does have a very short duty cycle. There's a workaround that's acceptable to me, but this is the only legitimate strike I've found against this machine\n\nThe bad:\nNone.\n\nI would heartily recommend this machine to any one who appreciates their coffee freshly ground."

Bodum thought all I needed to get it working again was a new burr insert which they sent as a no charge courtesy. Unfortunately it didn't help (timer/power switch had failed), but we certainly got way more than our money's worth (approximately 4,000 carafes of coffee). The silica glass container is a definite static free plus and unlike Bodum's carafes, it has a rubberized grip band so we've never broke it due to careless handling. Once we determined the right grind and timer setting for our taste we never had to adjust it again. As with any grinder, you should brush it clean regularly. Because we use very oily espresso roast beans, we also run a lid full of cleaner \"tablets\" made for costly commercial grinders through it every 90 days. We use a high end Rancillio grinder for our espresso machine so I can't comment on its suitability for really serious espresso machines."

I always hated those small hand grinders that make such a mess, and I finally got sick of the grinders I'd use at Trader Joe's which are never calibrated correctly. I'm so glad I finally got this one. The design is so perfect. First, it has a small footprint. It's definitely smaller than it looks in the picture, at least to me. Second, there are many different sizes of grind you can choose. I picked halfway between drip and espresso for my Aeropress, and it's perfect. Third, the one-touch pre-set timing mechanism is brilliant. You choose anywhere from about 5 seconds to 20 seconds, then just push a button. The grinder will automatically grind for that length of time. I don't have to hold it down, and I don't have to guess from day-to-day whether I'm getting it right. It just works. I used to weigh the same amount of coffee every day, but now I don't have to bother with that. And because the grind I can get is finer than I was able to get at TJ's, I actually use about 10 grams less coffee every day to make the same great, intense cup. Ten grams adds up, right? In no time this thing will pay for itself!\n\nIt's no joke about how mess-free this grinder is. I guess it's partially due to the glass, but it's also the design. There is one small hole at the top of the container and I just shake the coffee out of that right into my Aeropress. Absolutely no grinds anywhere on the counter. Love it.\n\nIf you've been on the fence, just go for it. You will not be sorry."

            "reviewText": "Update (07/08/2014)\nI have been using this grinder everyday for two years and it hasn't missed a beat. I am careful not to over-run it by waiting between grinding after 20 second-runs. It takes time to pull espresso, so this isn't much of a problem. I highly recommend this grinder if you can buy it for less than $100.\n\n*************ORIGINAL REVIEW****************\n\nBACKGROUND:(you can skip to pros and cons if you'd like)\nI've only been drinking coffee for the last 7 years or so, but being in Seattle, I've come to appreciate truly great coffees. Starbucks isn't too bad, it's not one of the better ones around here.\n\nWanting to enjoy good cup of coffee anytime at home, I began the search for the tools. I didn't want to go all they way and spend couple of grand to make espresso, nor even couple of hundreds of dollars. I couldn't afford them and my wife would never approve of it anyhow. So, I've tried drip coffee, french-press, Aero-press, but settled on\u00a0Bialetti 6800 Moka Express 6-Cup Stovetop Espresso Maker\u00a0for making a good cup of coffee. Meanwhile, I've also tried out some of the best rated coffee and settled upon\u00a0Jammin' Java Coffee Kingston City Roast, Espresso, Organic Gourmet Whole Bean Coffee. Medium Dark, Choco-nut & Creamy, 2.2-Pound.\n\nI've been grinding my beans with\u00a0Capresso Coffee Burr Grinder\u00a0which I had bought from local costco, but wasn't satisfied with the ground consistency nor the mess it created with the static it seemed to bring. With the great reviews and the container being glass, I decided to try this. Now, this was more expensive than the coffee maker and it was a \"big\" investment for me, but after using it for a month, it's worth every penny and then some.\n\nPROS:\n1. Grind - Consistency: The grounds are quite consistent, much more so than the Capresso burr grinder. This consistency seem to improve the taste. [A]\n2. Grind - Range: Range of how coarse or fine is quite broad. Though I'm just using one setting, it's there when I need it. [A-]\n3. Container - Mess: Because it's make of glass, there seems to be minute amount of static, if any. This makes it so much more pleasurable to use. [A+}\n4. Container: The container has rubber band around it to help with grips and has rubber cover with 3/4 inch hole in the middle. Nice thing about this cover is that just tapping on the cover pretty much releases all the coffee grinds from it and when you open it up none of the coffee grinds go anywhere since there's no static. [A]\n5. Aesthetic: It's nice looking and has smaller footprint than I had imagined. [A-]\n\nCONS:\n1. Time Limit: the max time you can run at once is about 20 seconds. However, if you press it again right away, it will run. I suppose Bodum wants you to give couple of minutes before you run it again to prolong the life of the machine. Some also has mentioned burr may become too hot and thereby destroying the coffee flavors, but I'm not sure about that. As for me, I run it once and start preparing my Moka and when I'm ready to add the coffee, I just run it again to finish it. So it's no big deal for me. [B]\n\nCONCLUSION: I've only been using it for a month, but I could not be happier with the purchase. This has to be the best sub-$100 grinder out there. As for durability, I will update in few months. Another thing I'm happy about is the color. Although my unit is white, it does not seem to get dirty much while looking good on the counter. I would highly recommend buying this grinder if you're serious about drinking a good cup of coffee."

I literally have not had to wipe up the counter around this Bodum in the two weeks or so that I've been using it.\n\nSuper easy and efficient to use -- so long to the banged up community grinder at Costco!

            "reviewText": "Amazon is amazing. It not only told when I bought this but allows a duplicate invoice to be printed. Brilliant!\n\nWhen my grinder was 22 months old it quit. Bodum replaced it free of charge as they have a 2 yr. guarantee. Great!\nThen, the 2nd one gave out the other day--again approximately two yrs. from receipt. I called to see if they could repair it, as I knew they wouldn't send me a new one again. They said they don't repair them! I was really angry but. in reading reviews of other grinders\nI found quite a few complaints about quality. In mine a screw got loose and the motor was bouncing around. It was, of course, made in China, but they need to improve quality control. They were also not gracious about it. So I won't order a Bodum again. Companies don't realize how important Customer Service is!\nOnce I learned about burr grinders I had to have one. I researched them and decided the Bodum was worth the extra money over the Cuisinart. ($80 vs. $50). I knew I wasn't about to spend over $100 on one as that seemed just too persnickety! I got some money for Christmas and ordered the Bodum.\n\nOthers have reviewed this thoroughly, showing buthow much coffee lovers care about their coffee, so I'll just say a few things. First, it really does make a difference in the quality of my coffee and, as that was the most important thing to me, I am thrilled. I've had delicious coffee every morning. Of course I start with good beans.\n\nThere are a couple of drawbacks to the grinder, however. The fact you have to wait 5 minutes after the first 20 seconds has been well noted. For me that hasn't been a major problem. I use 4 heaping coffee measures to make 8 cups/4 mugs of coffee for myself and, on coarse grind, that takes about 16 seconds. If I put in a little more than 4 I have waited a few seconds and finished it up. If I were to do 8 or so I would plan ahead. It's not a great feature but you can live with it.\n\nWhat has surprised me is that COURSE isn't very coarse. I guess that's OK as it still makes delicious coffee.\n\nWhat has annoyed me is that I can't seem to use it without making a mess on my counter. There are several reasons: Coarse is really Medium and therefore the grounds cling to the glass receptacle, its cover, the opening where the ground coffee comes out, and the cover of the cone. I have been working every day to overcome this, with some success, but I still end up with grounds on my counter top. The grounds do cling to the glass receptacle, though I thought glass was preferred over plastic because it didn't do that, and I have to scrape them out or lose them. Also, be sure the glass is absolutely dry.\n\nI notice one reviewer wrote that it didn't make a mess, which puzzles me, as when I looked up more expensive grinders one reviewer had the exact same experience I have.\n\nI see that there is a soft brush made for the grinder. I am going to get one as I see fine grounds collecting on the burrs. I think that is a worthwhile investment--$5 or so.\n\nSo, in conclusion, I give it 4 rather than 5 stars simply because of the messiness. If really great coffee is important to you I suggest this grinder is well worth the bother."

            "reviewDate": "July 3, 2011",
            "reviewText": "I've used a number of blade grinders in the past, and they all had two thing in common--tons of mess, and uneven grinding. I'm currently using a french press for a couple months (drip machine packed for moving), and have used a french press for years, especially when the office coffee was standard issue terrible. Bar none, every blade grinder has defeated the press, with varying degrees of literally sludge at the bottom of the cup. Well, no more. The Bodum beauty burrs out a nearly perfect consistency grind. I set it for expresso, I get baby powder. I set it for press, I get press grade grinds. At the bottom of my cup I still do get a minor, and I mean MINOR, amount of \"silt\" but this is literally the last few sips. More importantly, those last few sips are NOT gritty like every other grinder I've used will do. So, you may see a swirl of powdered grind at your last 4 sips, but you won't taste or worse feel it. For french press users, your perfect cup is now only limited by the quality of your beans.\n\nOperation: I have found it works best with a hopper full of beans. The timer and grind setting are most consistent then, as it feeds evenly. I know some people are worried about the 20 second every 5 minutes limits on the motor. Well, this isn't a commercial unit, it's under $100. Expectation management, people. For my morning 20 oz coffee, 7 seconds is plenty of time to produce 3 scoops of grind. 20 seconds should be fine for your average 10 cup pot, and if you are grinding expresso for 20 seconds, you are making a cup that will cause your heart to explode. Again, this is great for home use, not a restaurant.\n\nMess: The glass receiver and the soft rubber top keep it contained. I've gone through a lot of coffee getting my perfect cup down, and the counter top does not look like a disaster area. After the grind finishes and before I remove the glass receptacle, I usually tap the machine a couple time out of habit, but honestly haven't seen any noticeable grind settling. The other benefit of the glass receiver is when you dump it out, pretty much all the grind goes into your press or filter. No static electricity, no old coffee waiting for your next grind. Just on cleanup alone, this thing is awesome.\n\nNoise: This guy is reasonably quiet. It is grinding beans, so it will be noisy, but unlike all blade grinders I've used, this is a lower frequency noise and you can carry on a conversation with it running. Overall it is the quietest grinder I've used.\n\nVersatility: I've used this on several settings, and not just for coffee. I took the old trick of running some white rice through the burrs (after a thorough brush cleaning) to get all the coffee out, then used it to convert coarsely ground flax seed to finely ground flax seed. This took a while, as the course ground seed was already pretty fine, and flax tends to clump, so it fed slowly. But, once done, the fine flax seed was very well and evenly ground. I plan to use it on whole flax seed in the future, and expect it will feed much better.\n\nOverall, loving this machine and looking for excuses to use it!"

It works very well with only minimal scattering dust and produces an evenly fine grind for drip coffee.\nTo be more precise, I generally grind 48 grams of light roast (for 750 ml of water) at the fine setting, which takes a bit longer than the preset 20 second timer. So I just hit the timing button again. The warning about waiting 5 minutes between grinding sessions seems to me to be an exaggeration intended to keep some idiot from running the device continuously for several minutes to grind a big bag of beans (and that would likely fry any small motor).\nI don\u2019t do espresso, but the finest settings seem to be powdery enough. For an occasional French press pot, I use a coarse setting, which produces a mostly uniform grind with very little powder and has worked well even with dark, oily beans. At the very coarsest setting I once had a bean jam the device, though that was easily shaken loose.\nTo minimize dust left in the chute, I give the side of the device a hard slap before I take the receptacle out. That leaves about 0.1 grams of dust behind if you then brush out the chute. For information, a single coffee bean is about 0.1 to 0.2 grams.\nThe device is attractive and small enough to be left out on the counter, and most of the noise comes from grinding the beans. I like the presence of a separate power switch, so I do not feel the need to unplug the device between uses (and the chassis is not warm when off - it is not a secret power vampire.) The only downside to this device is the glass receptacle jar, which is likely not to survive a drop onto a hard, tiled kitchen floor.\nCombined with my Technivorm Moccamaster KBTS, I get great coffee with this."

That was really disappointing. I decided if these things are prone to kaput after a year or two, I'd buy CHEAPER. I found this one to be decently reviewed and cheaper than the Baratza Virtuoso. (I paid $82 in 2011.)\n\nWell, 1.5 years later, this one is still working. Let's see if it makes it to a longer work-life than the Baratza. I mostly use the drip grind for my Technivorm, and the press pot one for my Frieling, rarely the espresso. I make about 6 cups (Technivorm measure, which is closer to 3 cups) of coffee 3x a day.

Bottom line up front (BLUF): this machine provides a great espresso grind for the various roasts we've used so far which include dark oily beans. After several trial and error attempts to find the right grind setting for our Gaggia Classic, I found that the setting fifth from the finest was just right, providing a good extraction (around 20 seconds), abundant crema, and leaving a dry puck. I was surprised initially that this grind setting wasn't closer to the finest setting, but I think that may be more a function of the type of espresso machine being used. I've found that a 15 second grind cycle at that setting produces enough ground beans for two double espresso shots that become the basis for cappuccinos for my wife and I. We both feel the coffee tastes better than what our previous blade grinder produced. There is no mess nor static problem with this grinder. The only time I had a mess was when I started a grind and realized I forgot to put the glass container in place (my bad). Also, the 20 second rule and 5 minute wait in between which others understandably find to be a problem are not a big inconvenience for us. By the time we're ready for a second cappuccino, more than five minutes have passed since grinding the first batch and I can grind another. When I want to grind beans for regular coffee, I grind the beans in two batches. I can easily kill the five minutes between batches by doing some chores like setting the breakfast table, feeding the kitty, getting the newspaper, or washing some dishes from the night before ;). Ideally, it would be better if the grinder had a more robust motor - maybe future models will have it. Some have noted that the plastic used in the power switch and grind button have a cheap appearance. True - but they still work, so far. All in all I consider it a good product."

You can easily adjust the grind to whatever you prefer. It's a little noisy, but that's to be expected and you only run it for a few seconds when making your morning coffee. It's red plastic parts are tough and have remained bright and true to their color -- no fading or yellowing. Amazingly, I have managed not to break the carafe, knock on wood! I attribute that to careful use and washing combined with the fact that it's got a rubber grip on the outside. All in all, this a great product that you will use for years with no issues!"

Sometimes you venture into something new and buy the lowest cost item just to dip your toe in the water and then you figure out what you really want, in this instance, a burr grinder. This is a sturdy, robust product that produces a uniform grind.\n\nOh, if you don't have a digital scale you should buy one. Get used to how many seconds it takes to grind the desired number of grams for your beans.\n\nAfter the grind coffee remains in the chute so tilt it forward and give it a few taps on the side. You might want to turn off the unit before doing this because I have a bad habit of hitting the grind button again.\n\nWhether or not you have to deal with static electricity making a mess of things when you dump the grind into your brew basket is highly dependant on the humidity level in your home. The glass container does not eliminate static. I hold the container in my hand for a moment before dumping. And I keep a little basting brush nearby to sweep out anything left behind."

We've only had this a few weeks, but, it's exactly what we needed to make good strong coffee in our new OXO coffee maker. There's a definite difference in burr and blade; thanks to many other reviewers, I don't have to detail these. The Bodum is simple in design, easy to calibrate, and the glass container is infinitely easier to clean than the reservoir on the coffee makers w/self grinding capacity. Our preference is for dark roast, \"bolder\" flavor. We tinkered with the settings, and, came up with a setting of \"15\" - and the pointer is just past mid-way towards the French Press coarsest setting. The device is small, it's a bit noisy, but then grinders are noisy. We really hope that this stays functional; it's an excellent product thus far. I'll update in a few months."

Which is good because it's not exactly air tight (though still a good seal), so the beans don't dry out too quick.\nJar is a decent size, but does feel like it may be a tinge fragile. Time will tell.\nYou can dial in the grind size pretty well and it's a consistent grind.\nDownside - Dialing in the grind time for the right amount without wasting. This is pretty much an art, based on grind size and time. You could just fill the hopper with the amount of beans you want each time, but you still have to work the timer so it doesn't spin the gears forever on an empty hopper if you happen to turn away from it. And if you say do drip most days and then french press on others, the timing will be off because a coarser grind will come out quicker.\nI like it overall, but if your patience is thin, you may want to chose another."

If you finish grinding your beans and leave the device on, it remains on all day and gets rather warm. That means it's a huge energy suck. With the switch being on the side and hidden away (at least where I have located the grinder), unless you are actively thinking about turning it off, it will remain on.\n\n2. The grounds do not always perfectly enter the glass jar. This makes for a small mess after each use. Again, it's small, but annoying.\n\n3. The bowl (where the whole beans are stored) will spin loose if it's on the coarsest grind. Any other setting, it's just fine.\n\n4. I keep my grinder under the cabinet. It would be easier if I could refill the bowl by taking it off. However, there is no bottom to the bowl. I made the mistake one time and the beans flew all over the kitchen."

He usually takes forever grinding up a couple of large containers of coffee and makes a big mess. He only uses Starbucks French Roast whole beans that we get in bulk at Costcos. It is very time consuming and messy to do. But, unbeknownst to us you just put the beans in the top of this clean machine and quiet machine and figure out the grind and the time needed for your perfect pot of coffee and what a breeze. He sets it on medium and first pushes 20 seconds and then ten seconds and the container holds the exact amount he needs for his pot of coffee. We have a 12 cup coffee maker. Makes it a lot easier for me too since I am always second guessing what is the right amount of coffee and I do not miss grinding all that coffee and filling up those containers either. The hardest part of this job is just filling the top carafe with the whole beans. So now, every pot is a freshly ground pot and is so much easier. We just thought we were buying a coffee grinder and would still be filling up containers, what a great surprise! We love it. We've been using Bodum glass coffee cups for years and thought this would be a great product since their glassware is and were definitely not disappointed."

I read a few reviews here saying the espresso grind works for them, and I am here to say the same.\n\nI have used this grinder everyday since I received it (12/28/11), and I have had no issues. The espresso grind is very fine, and always uniform. I found that it takes about 10 seconds on espresso grind to produce enough for a double shot with just enough excess to distribute the grounds evenly. Brewing espresso with this grind gives me a nice crema, and getting better as I get used to my espresso machine.\n\nI used the french press grind once, just to see the difference in texture. It too was uniform, but I didn't brew as I don't have a French Press (yet). 10 seconds on the French Press grind ground about twice as much coffee as the espresso setting would for the same time.\n\nA note on the motor, it does only run for 20 seconds at a time. This doesn't mean it's not possible to run for longer.\n\nI will update soon.\n\n2/27/2013: My grinder is still grinding strong, no problems. It's done many grinds of different coarseness."

This made me concerned about its power and durability, but thankfully this turned out to not be an issue. When it's grinding, the motor runs easily and smoothly and has more than enough power. Personally I would not hesitate to run it longer than 20 seconds when necessary.\n\nI generally make 4 cups of coffee in a french press and i find a 13-15 second grind is the perfect amount.\nI would happily recommend this product to friends and family."

I leave it on my kitchen counter all the time.\n\n2. Consistent grind.\n\n3. Easy to operate, though you'll want to experiment to get the grind that's right for you. It took me a week before I nailed it.\n\n4. Cool color, wrapped in non-slip rubberized finish.\n\n5. Not excessively loud. It's a grinder, so some noise is necessary.\n\nCons:\n\n1. The timer. 20 seconds, max., is a disappointment. I grind 1.3 ounces of coffee beans daily, and the timer barely gives me enough grind time to get the job done. I nearly returned the unit because of this. Why make a product with such a sensitive motor?\n\n2. Kind of messy. There's no way around it--extra grounds end up around the base of the grinder and on the counter. It's a simple wipe-down, but it needs to be done daily.\n\n3. No click for incremental adjustments. This could be just my grinder, but the adjustment selector just slides from one mark to the next. No click.\n\n4. No lighted power switch. It's easy to leave the unit in the On position.\n\n5. No grind-release lever. This means the unit always has extra grounds in it. Move the grinder, or just clonk it by mistake, and spare grounds sprinkle out. A release lever would get most of the extra coffee out of the unit.\n\n6. I know this is subjective, but I'd expected to get a fresh-ground-coffee aroma. With the Bodum, I get fresh-ground coffee, but no smell to go with it.\n\nIn all, three stars (though 2.5 is closer to my best rating). The grinder does perform, but Bodum seems to have cut some corners. If I had it to do over again, I'd have spent more $ for a more solid unit overall."

And the container is glass which was critical to me since I avoid plastic as much as I can especially for food items. When grinding, one can select from many levels. Since I use a french press, I've selected coarse grind. I make one 20 oz cup coffee each morning. The grind selector runs by seconds and 5 seconds makes one morning's worth of coffee for me. The grinder will run for 20 seconds. I don't know how much coffee 20 seconds worth of ground coffee will make but if one needs more than 20 seconds ground coffee, then one can wait 5 minutes and grind more coffee. The only regret I have is that the hopper is plastic and I really, really wish it were glass. However, the grinder is attractive and has a small foot print so since the coffee isn't ground yet, I gave in on that one point. This grinder is also easy to keep clean, important since mine is on the kitchen counter. Overall, I highly recommend this grinder."

Something about the burr grind process generates tons of static charge and the finer your grind, the more it sticks to everything. Pulling the cup out generates a cloud of statically charged coffee that goes everywhere. I have to place the machine on top of a cookie sheet with a lip to contain the mess.\n\nThe ~20 second timer is a pain. Due to the mess it generates, I only use it once a month or so and tend to grind a large amount of coffee at a time, which takes forever.\n\nI think this is a problem with most burr grinders, but cleaning is a pain due to the shape of the chute that leads the grounds to the cup. You have to take it all apart, shake it and tap it all around, stick toothpicks down to scrape out the compressed grounds... It's quite a process.\n\nAlso very noisy; sounds like a loud electric motor inside of a plastic box, which is exactly what it is.

Cleanup is much easier and static-generation is almost non-existent.\n\nI bought another machine for my office and intentionally looked for one that could be run for a longer period without overheating. Even though it has the same static issues as this one, it feels much better built and indeed runs for 4-5 grind sessions without heating up noticeably:\u00a0Capresso 565 Infinity Conical Burr Grinder, Stainless Steel"

If you enjoy your cup not just for the benefits of caffeine, but also for taste, then it's time to step it up. This particular Bodum is d*mn good for the money if you're grinding up to 4 people max. If you have something beyond an entry-level espresso machine, then you should probably look at the solid $200 smart model.\n\nIt gets it down to a size that's good for pressurized filters all the way to french press thickness. The 20 second limit, well if you're into guidelines then yes, take it as a factor. You'll get enough grind for 2-3 people. However, that doesn't mean you can't run it back to back. Let alone letting it cool for just a minute in between if you want to stick close to said guidelines. For the money, can't be beat. If you're making espresso from a machine beyond entry level, look at the $200+ models.\n\nAs far as the oily-bean issue in the finest setting, well I couldn't tell you because I don't use oily beans in the espresso machine. But for filter/drip/presses which doesn't require fine grinding, this shouldn't be an issue."

The burr and gears of my copy are still going strong as of 2018-01-31, however the timed trigger died completely last summer so I DIY'd to bypass the PCB and use the main big switch on the side to control it. Besides, the black paint became sticky about 3 years ago, so I also sanded it off and recoated it myself. I thought of replacing it and had tried other blade type grinders but they only produced inconsistent ground, so returned all them and I kept coming back to this workhorse! I accidentally broke the ground holder glasses years ago, however it's easy to find a replacement metal tin (I use the TableCraft 10oz stainless steel dredge) that can still fit the original plastic lid tightly. The grinder is easy to clean (in fact nothing to clean if you can live with some residue but it never accumulates), easy to dump out the ground, minimal static, and it never shoots out coffee ground during its work. Avoid water humidity in the surroundings or in your beans otherwise the finest grind setting could clog it only sometimes. It could be loud (consistent sound and not sputtering or clunking like other grinders) and it's a good way to wake everyone up in the morning! Highly recommended."

If you try to take the hopper off, any remaining beans will spill out over the counter. I'm currently picking up the entire unit and pouring the beans back into the original container. This is tricky because the hopper doesn't securely attach and thus you need to hold both the hopper and unit.\n\nThere's a lot of grounds left inside the unit, which do not fall into the container. If you move or knock the unit, a lot of grounds fall out. This creates a mess, but also probably means the next time you grind, you'll get old grounds.\n\nIt's my first grinder, and seems to do a good job actually grinding beans, but I wouldn't recommend it."

            "reviewText": "I've been using a cheap \"blender\" style coffee grinder for over 10 years to make my morning french pressed coffee brew. There was a brief period I did get a burr grinder, but one day about three months in, it died. It did so grinding up bits of little internal plastic gears along with my coffee and spitting them out. So back to the cheap but reliable \"blender\" coffee grinders it was for the next five years.\n\nFinally I decided the coffee I was getting just wasn't consistent enough, and what I drank every morning had some element of a surprise. I don't like surprises in the morning when I'm in a rush to get to work.\n\nThis burr grinder is bigger and weighs about 5 times as much as my last burr grinder did, and feels very solidly constructed. Using it, you can set the coarseness and length of time of grind (which determines how much coffee is ground) and just push a button. Next time you want to grind, all the dials are still in the same physical location without having moved and you just push that same button again for the exact same consistent experience as the last time!\n\nOne thing that I was originally worried about was storing large amounts of roasted coffee stored in the top dispenser. Air exposure can affect the taste off coffee. But the lid creates an air-tight seal with the container. Air exposure would come from whatever air is already in the container when it's sealed, possibly with minor seepage, or possibly a bit might come up through the grinding path. But I so far have haven't been filling the container to the top and been going through the coffee before any possible air exposure/oxidation becomes a problem.\n\nAlso, my French Pressed coffee is much, much smoother now with 1/10th the sediment produced from the \"blender\" style grinder. This burr grinder just simply makes more evenly shaped grinds, and less \"coffee dust\" that ends up as the sediment at the bottom of your cup! I am now drinking much smoother and tastier french pressed coffee!"

Now granted, I did expect a difference from my blade grinder...otherwise I would not have spent $119 to experience a conical burr grinder.\nWhat I did not expect is that before the grinder arrived my coffee maker was tasting a \"bit tired\", like it needed the vinegar flush that I periodically do to freshen things up. Well I didn't get around to it...the grinder arrived, and of course I needed to check it out!\nNot only does this grinder perform as others have stated, ie: consistent, uniform grind, fairly quiet (you are grinding coffee folks). But it completely (and surprisingly) altered the taste of my coffee!! Same beans, same maker, same process, different flavor!! So smooth and tasty it is ridiculous!\nI really did not think a grinder could have such a dramatic impact on the taste. Now granted, I suppose \"any\" burr grinder may have me singing a similar tune...so on to the specifics of this machine.\nThe glass catch is very nice. I have experienced the plastic catch at a friends house which due to static cling had a \"permanent\" coating of coffee grounds inside. The glass catch simply needs a tap to clear. The plastic top seems to have a bit of the cling aspect to it, but it is easily dealt with.\nThe top loading area only holds about a third of a pound of coffee, but I was not looking to store coffee, only grind it. So it is nice to not have to load beans every time I want to brew.\nThe burr mechanism is \"burly\". Steel, solid, very nice. The upper part has a plastic outer piece that drops into place, like a collar. But the parts that are touching the beans are all metal.\nI kind of wish it had a cup setting as some other grinders have. Where you just dial in the number of cups you want and it automatically delivers the proper amount of coffee. The timer took a couple of uses to dial in...but at drip grind setting, middle of the dial I get a solid 8 cup brew from the 20 sec time. The 15 second time gives me a 4-5 cup brew, and in between for my normal 6 cup brew. I like to be able to just grind and dump. I don't want to have to measure each time. So you just need to grind and measure the one time to check the settings. Then it's grind a dump...so long as you are not changing the grind type ( I would assume this would change the amount delivered, haven't tried that yet?)\nI just got the grinder, I was so impressed I had to write a review. I will check back and add to this review if I experience any negative aspects, or to continue to sing praise, depending on my experience.\nAs of now, I will say I highly recommend this grinder!! It is fantastic! If you are on the fence, get off and buy it, it is great!!"

While this grinder is not whisper quiet, it is not obnoxious about it. Just a light grinding sound.\n\nThe glass cup is great. You do experience a bit of static each time, and it does build up over time. But it is nothing like the all plastic cups.\n\nIt does have a limit of how often you are supposed to run it in a 5 minute period, but I only make one pot at a time so this has never been an issue.\n\nI keep the grinding level set at the same place, set the time of the grind that I want, turn on the power switch, then hit the little red button next to the timer. Grind runs (about 13s for my setting) and then turn the power switch off. Good to go.\n\nI don't sweat a bit of coffee left in the glass grinding cup. It builds up over time. About once a week I rinse it out and lay it upside down on a paper towel. Do keep the paper towel close. It is quiet annoying to (while a bit fuzzy headed prior to that first cup of coffee) grind 13s of coffee, only to look down and see you didn't put the cup in place. ;)\n\nEnjoy"

However, this machine worked out very well for my french press. Yes, the coarse grind from this grinder compared to the one I got from the grocery was a bit finer, but it wasn't so fine that it gave me a lot of sludge at the bottom of my cup.\n\nWill keep updating throughout the life-cycle of this device."

Its quiet, produces very consistent grinds, has a glass receptacle that is free of static, and doesn't make a big mess. The metal conical burr grinding mechanism seems to be of good quality, and grinds don't get impacted in the chute. This design is also attractive and small enough to leave out on the counter full time. The only limitation is that the timer only goes to 20 seconds per grind cycle, but multiple cycles are easy enough, and two cycles of 20 seconds will fill the receptacle near the top. My wife wasn't thrilled with the idea of getting another coffee grinder, remembering the mess from ones in the distant past, but she likes this one.

            "reviewText": "I'd been using the same blade grinder for years and had never really been happy with the results. Coffee was always inconsistent and unless the planets were aligned, usually tasted like bleh. So I got used to going to Starbucks every morning for my brew.\n\nI finally decided to take the plunge on a burr grinder, and after reading the reviews and narrowing it down to a couple of units, I chose the Bodum burr grinder. And talk about a jump in performance, going from a $20 blade grinder to the Bodum grinder is like going from a Ford Festiva to a BMW.\n\nHere's what I like:\n- The convenience of the sealed container on top for the beans. I can dump most of a 1 pound bag of beans in there and not have to scoop them into the grinder every time I want to brew coffee like I did with the blade grinder.\n-There's no real mess. With the blade grinder, it was impossible to put beans in the container, grind, take off the lid, dump grinds into a container, then repeat 4 or 5 times, without spilling grinds everywhere. With the Bodum burr grinder, there is hardly any mess. I might notice some after a week of use, but it's pretty small. The beans are in a sealed container, and whenever I want to brew coffee, I just push the button and coffee grinds right into the glass container. The container lid effectively holds the grinds until I'm ready to pour them into the coffee pot.\n- It's simple. You've got 2 adjustments you can make: the grind size and the timer. Once you get a few pots brewed you'll figure out pretty quickly what settings work for you. And the settings are mechanical (not electrical) so even if you unplug the machine, the settings will remain where they are so you dont have to change them. Ever. (unless you want to)\n- And most importantly: Taste. So I didnt think a burr grinder would make THAT big a difference in the way coffee tasted, which is why I put off getting one for so long. But man, it makes a world of difference. Coffee just tastes much noticeably better. There's no real other way of saying it. I can even downgrade to cheaper beans now because they taste good too.\n\nThe one negative that you'll read about in a lot of people's comments is the 5 minute wait time the instructions tell you to give before grinding a 2nd helping of beans. With only a 20 second grinding timer, I can see why this would upset people. 20 seconds, in my opinion, is not long enough to grind enough beans to brew a full pot of strong coffee. And nobody wants to grind for 20 seconds, wait 5 minutes, then grind again. That totally destroys the convenience of the product. However, this is not a problem for me, as I am the only coffee drinker in the household. I have yet to need to go anywhere near the 20 second time limit, so this is not an issue for me.\n\nThere are several reviews that offer advice on dealing with this issue though, my favorite being \"just brew a half pot at a time.\" It's still not perfectly convenient, but if I need a full pot, that's what I'll do. That said, if you constantly brew full pots of coffee, then this grinder might not be for you.\n\nSo that's it. If you can deal with the 5 minute wait in between grinds, then this grinder is for you. I have nothing bad to say about it at all.\n\nTwo caveats:\n(1) I don't own an espresso machine, so I can't comment on the espresso grinding ability of the grinder (I only grind for brewed coffee). From most reviews though, it seems to do espresso grind pretty good.\n(2)The only other grinder I've ever owned was that $20 blade grinder, so I have nothing else to compare the Bodum to. Keep that in mind. While I might consider this a $50,000 BMW, I'm sure other reviewers on here have owned the 6-figure \"lamborghinis\", \"bugattis\", and \"Bentleys\" of the bean grinder world. It's all relative."

I drank it with cream and sugar, and usually I can't tell the difference between a good cup versus a bad one. But when I finally started getting into coffee drinking: taking it black, savoring all the flavor differences between different roasters and bean origins, I knew I need to beef up my coffee supply and equipment to match my new-found hobby. So I set out to get a burr coffee grinder after being recommended by EVERY coffee tutorial. The problem is, I don't want to pay the price tag the pros pay, and yet I still want a decent quality grinder.\n\nMy requirements:\n- Electric grinder. As much as the non-powered ones are great quality and all that, it's just not very practical to ask someone who's barely awake and under a time crunch to do all that work early in the morning\n- sturdy built, will therefore last a while (a long while...)\n- small in size, since I don't have that much counter space nor do I need a lot of coffee storage space\n- can be easily taken apart for cleaning\n- decently priced (looking at half of the price tag of a high-end model)\n\nBodum definitely fits most of the criteria. After reading a lot of the reviews, I placed my order. And now, more than 9 months later, I'm happy to report that I'm very pleased with my purchase.\n\nA few comments regarding some of the common complaints people have:\n- the timer setting on the grinder: if you're a serious coffee drinker (read: coffee snob), then this should not be much of a problem, because you'd be grinding beans fresh for every cup instead of brewing up a big pot (or grinding beans ahead of time for storage)\n\n- small bean storage chamber: again, if you tend to buy the 12oz single origin roasters type of beans, you would not be storing it in that chamber anyways (you'll want to store them in a air-tight container) and let the beans go rancid that way. So all you'll be doing is putting a few scoops in right when you're about to grind. The chamber space is really not an issue in this case, as a result\n\n- Cleaning of the grinder: the burr grinder can be taken apart easily to a certain extent, but not all the way. So you'll need to buy separate cleaning pallets to remove the coffee grind residues. If there's anything I'd like to see improvement on, this would be my request.\n\nAll in all, the grinder is sturdy, does its job, grinds very well, and I've been enjoying excellent coffee every morning. And the fact I didn't break my bank doing so, it's totally a good buy."

Other companies use plastic and the ground coffee becomes magnetized during the grinding process and is difficult to remove. Bodum solved the problem by using glass. After the coffee is ground I invert the container over a coffee filter and lightly tap the bottom and presto all the coffee lands in the filter. The design is also very European and fits right in with a modern kitchen."

I liked it so much that I bought a second one as a gift for a family member. Of course, I now need to use it for a few more months to see how it holds up.\nUpdate 2 years later: The grinder is still working as well as it did when it was new.\nUpdate 2.5 years later: the drive gear inside is broken.

Fortunately, I ignored the reviews. The Bodum Bistro Electric Burr coffee grinder is perfect for espresso grinds. Moreover, I read complaint after complaint about it not being able to handle oily beans. This is Absolutely false! I use very oily french roast beans and it has no problem grinding enough for at least 2 or 3 pulls in the 20 second limit. By the time I'm done making my latte (my preference) 5 minutes have passed and I can grind more beans as necessary. People complaining about having to wait 5 minutes need to wake up and smell the coffee! This grinder is over $100 cheaper than the cheapest \"better burr grinders\". At that price difference, I can wait a few extra minutes. I purchased my grinder on sale at Amazon for $74.50. I did have to spend several weeks checking amazon to get that price, but it was worth the wait to save money. People experiencing problems with not getting enough ground beans for a pull need to READ THE INSTRUCTIONS. It tells you how to calibrate the grinder for first use as well as re-calibrating when you change settings. If you don't follow the directions you will have trouble. Also, Eventually, the grinding gear will clog and you will need to remove and clean it and re-calibrate for use. I have only had to do this once in the last 9 months and I use my espresso maker daily, so my grinder gets heavy use."

As a reference, at home, I have a Capresso Infinity Grinder\u00a0Capresso 560.01 Infinity Burr Grinder, Black\u00a0and a Gaggia Coffee Delux espresso machine.\n\nHonestly, I am a bit disappointed. First off, the finest setting won't be enough for some of the pump-based espresso machines. It also comes with a very wide \"bean reservoir\" on top, which makes storage a bit difficult. Next, I'm not very used to the combination of the power button, timer, and the start button. On the Capresso, it's very simple, plug it in and set the timer and the grinder will start automatically. For this machine, you will need to first power on, then set the timer, then press start. While it's grinding, the timer doesn't count down - so it's a bit hard to predict when precisely it's going to stop.\n\nBottom line: if you're deciding between the Capresso and the Bodum... just go for the Capresso. The name brand just isn't worth it."

But I really can't fault the machine for this, especially given the price range. I was shocked to see the price had increased from $80 in 2011 to $139 in 2014. I guess Bodum realized they had a hit on their hands.\n\nI recommend this grinder for those who like standard drip to expresso -- it excels at these levels of courseness. For french press folks, this grinder might be a bit fine even at the coarsest setting. However I used it this way just by adjusting the brew time to about 3.5 minutes rather than the more usual 4 - 4.5."

We sometimes need more time than the timer allows for--big batches require more grinding time--but we don't wait the recommended five minutes between runs; we just do it. And, you know what? We haven''t had any problems! No overheating. No burning motor smell. No problems. Are we shortening the lifespan of the productt? Maybe. Maybe not. As they go, this is a very affordable burr grinder, with little of the muss and fuss sometimes associated with cheaper burr grinders. I'm willing to replace it a little sooner, if that's what it comes to. Then again, we see no indication of needing to anytime soon."

Quality grind, low noise, very little mess, and reasonable capacity! Sure it could hold more beans, but this is small nit compared to other grinders I have had. The Starbucks did hold more beans and was nice, but footprint was a bit larger and the selector switch kept breaking with no replacement! The Krups is a joke...low capacity, loud noise, very messy, and inconsistant grinder...gets stuck. We purchased Bodum in black originally last summer and are very pleased. We recently purchased a second \"white\" model for our cabin, and saved $40 over the black model. Highely recomend if you are looking for quality grinder."

A burr grinder is necessary for anyone looking to make espresso, but also works great for other types of coffee preparation such as pour over, drip, french-press, and cold brew. Big step up from rotary-blade herb grinders.\n\nDetails: I have one of these at the office, one at home, and just bought a third for my girlfriend's parent's Christmas present. I've had mine for almost a year now, the one in the office has been around even longer. They work great for fine-grinding beans for espresso, but can also switch to corser grinds for pour-over, drip, french-press, and cold-brew.\n\nBurr grinders have, what I'd describe as a spindle that evenly grinds beans. This is a huge step up from rotary-blade herb grinders which is what I grew up on. Of course, either option is better than pre-ground beans. Did I mention I am a bit of a coffee snob?"

            "reviewText": "I have been using the grinder twice a day for about a week. I wanted to comment on some of the reviews I have read.\n\nI have been using a blade grinder for convenience for quite a few years. I owned an Italian hand burr grinder that mounted on a table or on the wall. It was messy and to keep the wife happy I stopped using it. I liked the rhythm, working a little for my brew (it required some force to turn in a vertically oriented circle, but not intolerable). I lost it in a move and, upon reading up trying to improve the taste of my coffee, I discovered that the burrs are highly recommended.\n\nSo after a friend accidentally damaged the lid on my whirlybird, I decided to invest again in a burr grinder. Not having the expendable income to purchase a high-end grinder, I decided to try the Bodum, with some reservations.\n\nI am so far very satisfied. I don't know where the complaints about grinds flying around are coming from. I roast my own beans, drinking both decaf and regular in many varieties, and there is virtually no mess, I have never considered wiping anything up. I grind between drip and espresso on the machine, about three-fourths of the way toward the finest grind. Perhaps the problem with others comes from the coarseness of the grind, or maybe just different production quality. The glass vessel into which the grinds fall seems solid and fits snugly in my hand.\n\nThe grind seems exceptionally even. There is no comparison whatsoever with my last grinder. The quality of the coffee has improved greatly, I am again tasting flavors I remembered from the days of the old hand grinder. I was skeptical but I imagine the extraction is so even that you maximize the flavor. I am loving it so far.\n\nThe 20 second issue is problematic. At the above setting, I can grind four coffee scoops of beans (one tablespoon each) in 20 seconds. But sometimes I grind five and I run to a stop with beans left. I have decided to wait maybe fifteen seconds and then hit the start button for another six to eight seconds and then stop it to grind the remaining beans. It is mostly just finishing up bits and pieces at that point. I will see how this affects the motor.\n\nIf the motor lasts, then this is an awesome deal. I have not tried the espresso grind, don't have a machine. But the 3/4 fineness is very fine. There is a video online from a Seattle store that demos the machine. I would imagine that a better quality machine would cost three times as much. The lack of a mess is such a big advantage, and the flavor is unquestionably better. If this is in your price range, I highly recommend you try it.\n\nUpdate: After nearly 18 months the grinder is working as well as ever. I make coffee twice daily, no sign of slowing down, no strange noises. I am very happy with this purchase!\n\nUpdate #2: After four years of grinding, making coffee at least twice a day, this Bodum is still going strong. No problems whatsoever, no mess on the counter, still an even grind.\n\nI have no issues, it works like new. If I exceed the 20 seconds when making a larger pot I always let the grinder rest for a minute or so to give the motor a break.\n\nSince I purchased this grinder I have had to replace both my automatic drip coffeemaker and my coffee roaster. As expenditures go in this throw-away society, this has been an excellent investment,\n\nGary"

I think the fact that the top of the grounds receptacle is rubber really helps alleviate that problem in this grinder.\n\nThe one drawback would be that it only grinds for 20 seconds at a time. For me, that's not really an issue, as that will produce 6 \"cups\", enough for a travel mug full for both me and the wife each morning. The manual suggests you must let it sit for five minutes before grinding more; I have on occasion (when we had visitors and needed a full pot) almost immediately ground some more. Conceivably doing that every day could shorten the life of the grinder, but I have not had any problems with my typical usage."

I actually have a much more in-expensive \"blade\" type grinder that we use for grinding dried spices, but I heard that the \"burr\" kind is the best for coffee grinding and I wanted one with control to make a course grind for percolating. The Bodum Bistro Electric Burr grinder is fantastic! I was originally going to purchase a more expensive machine, but this one has a real glass hopper to catch the grinds, unlike the pricier one with a plastic hopper. Also, it has easy to use controls, clean up is easy and the bright red color adds a nice \"pop\" to my kitchen - great to see they offer a variety of colors! Our coffee is more delicious than ever now that we can grind in small batches and brew right away! :)"

While the glass container helps with static, static is still an issue when using darker-roast beans - not so much in terms of making a mess but with more grounds sticking inside the container. It will struggle and clog if try to grind dark-roast beans on finest espresso settings, but I almost never make espresso and when I do, have a Starbucks Barista which uses a pressurized portafilter, so doesn't need to be so fine anyway. Since I'm partial to light/medium roast coffees and normally use for drip machine, these things are non-issues for me.\n\nThe marked settings for drip and espresso could be better. For drip coffee I use just a notch or so coarser than the preset to prevent fines in my coffee using mesh filter while still getting good strong taste, and you will likely want to grind a little finer for french press than the marked setting.

I would recommend getting the black model if it can match your d\u00e9cor. My white machine is coffee stained from powdery coffee residue."

            "reviewText": "I would recommend this unit without reservation.\nI did a lot of research on coffee grinders and selected this one because of the glass grounds container. The last couple of grinders we've had were plastic and the static electricity was a MAJOR problem trying to scoop or pour the grounds from the container.\nThe glass container removes 99% of the static. The grinding selector (course to fine) makes the grounds perfect for your choice. I like espresso and the fine setting is perfect.It is very quiet when grinding and the only draw back is the timer setting. It will grind enough for a small press or 3 espresso shots on the 20 second setting. But then you are supposed to wait 5 minutes for the motor to cool off before grinding more. If you are planning to make several cups at once, I'd suggest pregrinding what you'll need and storing it in a glass container."

            "reviewText": "I have limited counter space, so the compactness of this unit is great, particularly since it shares the area with a coffeemaker and espresso machine. It does a nice job on the grinding, and I like the glass cup. The only issue is the 20 second limit on the grinding time before you are advised to wait 5 minutes. I pretty much ignore this unless I'm making 12 cups for guests, and then I plan ahead. I don't know, maybe my unit will burn out early as a result, especially since I prefer a finer grind. Overall, I'm happy though, in spite of the poor motor design...no one else I know has to consider a 20 second rule! Update June 30, 2016: This thing is a little work horse, and is still doing a great job. I've been ignoring that 20 second \"rule\" everyday that I've used it, and I can report that it hasn't blown-up or stopped working. I still appreciate that it is compact, and I would definitely buy this model again."

Yes, as with any burr grinder, if you are grinding super fine, it's going to need to be 'de-clogged' once in a while. For espresso, I fill the grinder with beans only 1/4 to 1/3 of the way or less, and each time run a handfull of rice through. I also give it a nice 'tap' with my portafilter, to help knock out some of the grinds that might be hanging out into the portafilter. I'm not sure about the motor burning out- we use ours quite often- probably averages out to daily, but often are doing more than one espresso. We are about to start using it for regular coffee and will likely not wait 5 minutes in between grinds to get enough for a pot."

I brew one cup at a time so the timed grind provides more than enough grounds for me. The grinder looks good, feels well made and is not very loud.

It has taken me a little bit of trial and error to find the best settings but nothing too difficult. I typically make less than 8 cups of coffee in my drip coffee machine, so I started by putting that amount of beans in the Bistro. I set the timer to the max and the grind to \"medium\" let it go; it took about 19 seconds to finish the job. I thought the grind was just a little too fine at that setting, but the coffee was tasty! With the hopper full of beans they grind a little faster, likewise with the setting midway between medium and coarse. So I get 8 cups worth of grounds in about 17 seconds. The time-quantity curve seems to be fairly linear, so if I want less I dial accordingly. The max my coffee maker will do is 10 cups and I expect that 20 seconds will do the job. If not, I will will just hit the button and grind some more; the motor doesn't get hot at all and I think a 20 second grind followed by another 5 or 10 seconds would, on an occasional basis, be fine. Bottom line: easy to use, solid construction, very little in the way of mess and best coffee ever!"

For the Pourover crowd, this will grind 51 grams of coffee in the 20 second grind time. I think the grinder is very well made, and the grind size is VERY uniform in size and their is minimum static. In summary, a great choice for 1 to 2 people (perfect for the pour over crowd), but for larger groups either grind ahead or look elsewhere and be prepared to pay quite a bit more."

It's pretty cool that you can change the grind and how long to grind for. I haven't tried the espresso grind yet but the coarse grind is just what I wanted. I wish I had the tasting ability to say I noticed a difference between grinding it everyday and once a week but I honestly don't. In any case, it's great!"

Not sure why some reviews complained about it looking dirty and stuff sticking to it, we've had it on the busiest part of the counter for 3 months, and it's black and has not accumulated anything. Really like being able to grind up a small container-full, and then pull shots from our Breville espresso machine for the rest of the session. Very convenient being able to store the beans in the hopper, saving us the trouble of constantly pouring into something - it cuts out a step in the process for you. It's high quality materials and looks like it'll last for a while. The various 'time-to-grind- settings make sense, once you get used to how long you need to grind, for how much coffee you're making. Not a deterrent at all. The grind is exact. If you know what you need to grind for, you can pull it off with perfection with this thing."

The grind is consistent over the range of settings. I had very little brown sludge from my french press this morning, and my espresso had a nice crema, and formed a solid puck after proper tamping and pulling. I have to dial in the exact grind setting I want for the extraction time I am looking for, and so far this grinder has allowed me to get close on my third try. That said, the smallest grind setting sounds like it is rubbing the burrs together. I will not use it because I don't want to grind them down prematurely. Maybe in a few months once they dull it will be necessary to use this setting for my espresso, but right now it is fine on the second to smallest setting.\n\nCleaning is easy, you just lift off the bean holder with a quick twist and the top burr is easily removed from the lower one, allowing you to brush them both off. The only \"problem\" is that the exit shoot from the burrs to the holder is slightly hooked, so you're going to get some grounds that stay in there. You can tilt the grinder forward and knock the grounds loose while the container is still in place, but you're still going to have a few grounds. That said, the hook is much slighter than I've seen on other grinders and ultimately does allow you to blow out the grounds with fairly little work. I can do this after each grind in 30 seconds while my coffee is brewing.\n\nIn short:\nEasy to clean\nConsistent grind"

This grinder replaces a cheap burr grinder (which I now use for drip coffee as it doesn't grind fine enough), and the difference is dramatic. The build quality is excellent. In the finest setting, it will grind extremely fine, actually too fine for my machine (DeLonghi EC-702), so I use it on the third notch from the finest (between the 'espresso' and 'drip' marks). I have had this grinder now for a couple of months and use it daily. Works flawlessly and grinds very consistently. The only complaint I have is about the white finish, which can be easily stained by coffee grounds (my fault for resting the tamper and coffee scoop on the cover), but that doesn't warrant lowering my rating.\n\nOne more thought: being a pretty thrifty person, I was hesitant to spend $70 on a grinder since I only spent $125 for the espresso machine, but this is really only about $20 more than much lesser grinders, and it produces a much better drink. Investing an extra $20 on the espresso machine would not make much of a difference, so the extra $20 on the grinder will give a much more significant upgrade."

Secondly, the instructions state that the grinder can only work 20 seconds at a time (using the timer) and then the little guy needs a five minute break. That wouldn't be a problem except 20 seconds does not grind enough coffee for a full pot. This may again be due to the underpowered motor.\n\nOverall, I think it's a good grinder but keep the shortcomings in mind before swiping that credit card."

            "reviewText": "I bought my Bodum grinder 11 months ago. Like most reviewers I find it easy to use, easy on the eyes, reasonably quiet and absolutely reliable so far.\n\nUntil a couple of months ago, I would have given the grinder 4 stars. My only quibble would be the jar. Though I haven't broken mine yet, it is certainly a little on the fragile side. Also, sliding the jar in and out of the grinder would always result in a few grounds being spilled onto the counter-top. Fiddling with the silicone rubber cap would often create another small spill. It's easy to throw the jar and cap into the dishwasher but cleaning them is still another minor chore to deal with.\n\nThe Secret:\nDon't use the jar! A couple of months ago, it dawned on me that I could just hold the coffee filter under the grinder when I hit the button. The grounds go directly into the filter which I then transfer directly to the coffee maker. There's rarely any spillage at all in this process. Not having to deal with the jar makes a significant impact on the effort to brew a cup of coffee. This is especially appreciated on early mornings when my energy level is low.\n\nThe only time grounds escape is when I sometimes bump the grinder. This causes a few grounds which are stuck in the top around the burr to fall down to the base. This can happen whenever the jar isn't inserted."

After reviewing my options and not wanting to spend an arm and a leg, went with the Bodum, which had a lot of positive reviews. To be honest, my wife and I were not prepared for the degree to which burr grinding made a difference. All I can say is, \"Wow - what a revelation!\" The coffee is consistently much smoother and reveals more of its complexity than our old blade grinder. For us, setting it at the next to coarsest setting, and for about 16 seconds, produces just the right amount for our 8 cup press. Like others, we appreciate that the receiving cup is glass, which minimizes \"static cling\". After a month or so of everyday use, we haven't found a single negative about this product!"

Bodum recommends that you only run the motor for 20 seconds every 5 minutes. I usually grind 42g of coffee beans each time I make coffee (enough for about 20 oz. of coffee by Chemex method), and the maximum 20 second grind time seems about right for 40g. So, sometimes I can grind all the coffee I need, and sometimes I can't. I'm not a super coffee Nazi, and don't mind having the grinds sitting in the collector for 5 minutes for the next grind cycle, but sometimes I just want coffee now. Like RIGHT now.\n\nTo summarize: this thing is great. It's grinding abilities are about as good as you can find at this price point, but the grinding time limits can get a little annoying.

After hearing and reading all of the pluses to grinding your coffee beans just prior to brewing I began searching for a grinder to meet my \"entry level\" needs and budget. Having read that blade grinders are inexpensive yet inconsistant and burr grinders being the \"best\", I began searching different sites and types. Deciding a conical burr grinder was my wish list item, I checked Amazon to see what was available and compare prices.\n\nI chose the Bodium Bistro in Red. Bodium, because I've used their products before and have been pleased and, because the price was the best for a conical burr grinder on a limited budget. It's fairly easy to figure out how to use. As thick as the instruction book is, it leaves something to be desired. It tells what the parts are, what the symbols mean and that is it.... in a ton of different languages It doesn't explain length of time grinding or have any such tips. The good thing, the grinder is easy enough to figure out and much can be learned by trial and error.\n\nIt's quiet for an appliance that grinds, clean up is not difficult, consistency of grind is good, it's sturdy, larger than I expected, but not overwhelmingly so and in red, <grin> it's pretty. I am pleased."

I haven't had an issue with grinds building up in the machine as other reviewers have, but I don't use the finest grind setting. I doubt this would be suitable for espresso as it'd be difficult to get the setting just right. It tends to get bumped somehow and I must reset the grind often. This is not at all an issue for drip coffee but I'm not sure it has the precision required for espresso. That being said, I haven't actually tried to use if for my espresso machine.

It's not too big, it makes no mess at all, the grinds are great, and one more thing: I almost didn't buy it because someone (erroneously) wrote in their review that you can only grind for 20 seconds every 5 minutes. Well, it does recommend in the manual that you let it sit for 5 minutes between grinds, but you don't have to if you don't want to. 20 seconds seems like enough to make a big pot of coffee, especially because this little guy is pretty fast at grinding, but if you need more, just hit the start button again and it will do it again. I have not tried to do this more than twice as I have no need to grind a giant quantity of coffee. I suppose that like with all grinders this big, you probably don't want to do that because the grinding cones will get hot and affect the taste of the coffee.\n\nSo overall, just get it if you like the way it looks. I did because it was the only one at this price range that had a glass container, and now I grind my coffee fresh every day because it's so damn easy to use and clean."

Took it all apart, cleaned it, etc. The motor works, it just doesn't grind coffee beans.\nContacted Bodum by email asking for service info. No response. Contacted Bodum by telephone and was told that they do not service their products. No kidding. If the product is in warranty, they'll replace it with a comparable product. This one, of course, was 2 months outside of warranty.\nSo I paid over $50 per year to grind coffee beans. It's a nice looking grinder, but I don't have room on my kitchen counter for a cute decoration.\nIn the end, I feel that it was way too expensive for the 2 years that it worked, and that the Bodum brand is not one that I will purchase in the future."

Simple to use and clean and almost ZERO coffee dust! This grinder is really worth the price tag. If you're planning on spending less on a grinder save your money and have your local coffee shop grind your beans for you. Cheaper grinders produce too much coffee dust (resulting in a bitter cup) or cannot grind fine enough or consistenly enough."

The grinder is attractive on the countertop, relatively quite, easy to operate, and mess-free. The glass receptacle is also a nice touch, compared to the plastic ones offered by other grinders in this price range. My only complaint is that this grinder is primarily aimed at people that use drip-machines. In other words, the finest grind is not really fine enough for espresso, and the coarsest grind is not as coarse as desired for french press. I am primarily a french press drinker, and the grind is manageable (the plunger is not terribly difficult to press down), but typical brew times need to be shortened to get an equivalent taste. Overall though, I'm much happier with this grinder than my old blade grinder, the coffee is noticeably better, and I would definitely recommend it to others!"

My last two( an older Bistro and Antigua) reside at my office and still are operating under heavy use.\nThe glass collecting container does indeed work well to reduce static for those dark roast coffees which will translate to less cleaning up after the grind.\nI also appreciate the rubberized surface on the main housing and on the glass collector as I am known to be a bit of a clutz.\nThe primary power switch and the instant on/off switch paired with a timer switch are a good combo. No longer will I grind way too much and have to pull the power plug for it to stop as with past models.\nThe grind seems to be consistent for espresso through French press grades, though I find the espresso (extreme left setting) in all of my Bodums seems too fine.\nHopefully this new Bistro will have the longevity of the previous burr grinder models."

At home I have the Breville BCG450XL, but I wanted to try a slightly cheaper option for the office so I got this grinder. It produces a consistent grind as I expect from a burr grinder, which is good. However, it has several downsides:\n\nOne significant annoyance is that all of the ground coffee doesn't drop into the catcher -- there's usually a little left in the machine which falls out after you've removed the catcher. The end result is that there are always bits of ground coffee beans on my counter.\n\nAnother annoyance is that some of the grounds always stick to the walls of the glass catcher. With the plastic catcher of the Breville grinder, this never happens.\n\nFinally, as others have noted, it can only run for 20 seconds as a time (which isn't usually a problem for me personally).\n\nOverall, I would say that this grinder is not worth the ~$20 savings compared to the Breville grinder.

Out of the box it's just ok; a bit loud but not bothersome if everyone's up. My biggest complaint is the mess it makes. Grinds spew out all over the counter, stick by static cling to the inside and outside of the jar; it's next to impossible to get all the coffee out of the jar and into the pot.\n\nSo, I came back looking for the instructions to do the mods and for the life of me, I can't find the post I originally read about it. As best I could recall it involved tracing a part and cutting out a shim out of business card stock. I disassembled the grinder and found a metal plate that looked like a likely candidate. The plate was too big for a business card so I cut it out of a manila folder, poked all my holes and reassembled the grinder. There were three screws that hold the grinder assembly to the plastic housing and I could only get one of them back in. As long as that one screw was tight, it didn't look like it would drastically affect anything so I left the other two out.\n\nPlugged it in, loaded it up, switched it on and held my breath ... WOW!!! It works enormously better! It's a bit quieter, and the sound is more ... I dunno ... it sounds better engineered, I can't quite describe the difference. And the finest grind setting is powdery, consistent, aromatic, and it doesn't fly around the counter, it doesn't cling to the jar, it doesn't leak out of the grinder in a pile after removing the jar.\n\nIf I'd been working instead of tinkering with this all afternoon, my consulting billing rate would have purchased a $300 grinder, but I don't think it would have been such a satisfying experience.\n\nMy thoughts are that these things are inconsistently assembled at the factory - some of them work right, some don't. If you get the good one, wonderful. If not, get out the screwdriver and exacto knife and have some fun!"

These consumer grinders are not serviceable so I bought an expensive commercial grinder. Pretty much what you'll see at a coffee shops. Love it. I keep it in the basement cuz it's so big. Also, if it breaks, part are available.\n\nI can go on about this: consumer products like this Bodum grinder are built as cheap as possible. I don't fault them, I guess. That's what consumers want: inexpensive. Typically this all works out, but coffee is complicated. Too fine of a grind and the filter clogs and spills over. Too course and you miss out on flavor, or use too much coffee. So, a burr grinder is a must. $100 is not enough money to get you a durable burr grinder. I found a used commercial machine for $325, retail of $900. It's dreamy. It's a beast. It does exactly what I want and does it well. I looked and I know I can get a new power supply, a new grind wheel, a new power switch, any part. Love that."

            "reviewText": "UPDATE: December 2015\nMy grinder just died on me. I bought it June 2001 so it lasted me for about 4.5 years of daily use (using it between 4 and 5 times per day). It still grinds however the coarseness can no longer be set and it grinds everything very fine regardless of how I have it set. I opted to replace this one with a Breville BCG820BSSXL The Smart Grinder Pro Coffee Bean Grinder, Brushed Stainless Steel. It's a big bump up in price however I decided that this was something I wanted to try (after much research).\nI still think highly of the Bodum Bistro (I even just bought my son one for Christmas in 2015). It served me well and did a great job grinding my beans.\n\nI have thus far been using a blade grinder to grind my beans. I had been using a drip coffee machine but have since migrated to the Aerobie Aeropress to brew my coffee. I had read a lot of reviews about the burr coffee grinders and was preparing to spend up to $200.00 for a good one. I wound up reading the reviews of this grinder and saw that there were many reviews and they were for the most part, highly positive. So, I ordered this and it arrived within a couple of days. I could not be happier with the results! Here are my observations:\n\n- Very consistent grind. I noticed some people complaining about this but I have had no issues at all. I suppose there may be some irregularities now and then but none that I have observed.\n- Very clean. I read that there is often an issue with the static charge buildup on the coffee grounds when using this type of grinder. I have not had any issues with mess.\n- Simple to use. Set the grind type, pour in some beans, power it on, set the timer, press button to start / stop. The timer makes sense as it prevents the grinder from running too long if it gets turned on accidentally some how.\n- Not too noisy. It's certainly quieter than my blade grinder. I don't know how it compares to other burr grinders however I have no complaints about the noise level.\n\n- I noticed that for three scoops of coffee that it takes about 25 seconds to fully grind. This is how much coffee I use for a venti sized cup of coffee. It's no problem as I simply push the button to run it again and push to turn it off once all of the coffee has been ground. I imagine that this is also affected by how fine the grind is set for.\n- I am easily able to transfer the coffee from the container to my Aeropress without taking the lid off. I place the container on my Aeropress and tap to get all of the coffee out.\n\nI do strongly urge you to try this if you are in the market for a burr coffee grinder. The price and performance are excellent!"

I set the time for 5 seconds and that is the perfect amount for my double shot in my DeLonghi espresso machine. I have it set to the third from smallest grind which seems to be great for my machine.\n\nIt's fast, relatively quiet, and grinds evenly and consistently. I love that the container is glass so there's not a static issue (there's a rubbery piece that goes over top of it that a few grinds can cling to, but this hasn't been a big deal to me)."

The only downside (which causes the 4 out of 5 stars) is that you have to kind of tap the lid and bang the side to get all the coffee out of the shoot after grinding. Also, after 4.5 years, the plastic part that holds the upper grinding ring broke, but a phone call to Bodum and I had a new, free grinding ring a week later. I would have purchased one (the plastic part), but they don't sell it. Regardless, they get a big thumbs up for service - I would not have been very happy if I needed to purchase a new grinder over a piece of replaceable plastic.\n\nAs for cleaning, it's pretty easy to take everything apart and clean out old coffee residue.\n\nOn a side note, I don't know why they make the hoppers so big on these devices. It's generally not recommended to store coffee beans in the hopper (I only use ~1/4 cup of beans for a 3 cups in a 4-cup Mr. Coffee machine).\n\nUpdate: May 2016\nAfter nearly 5.5 years of near daily grinding (1/4 cup of beans, once a day), the motor seems to be in its death throws. Whenever I press the button to grind, it grinds for maybe a second before shutting off. It even does this when empty and after cleaning it out. I suspect something has finally gone wrong on the inner parts. So, this grinder is being retired after its faithful service and being replaced with a Capresso Infinity 560.01 (because it was a little cheaper, but also gets very high marks).\n\nI also noticed that the replacement upper grinding ring has some issue. The plastic ring that holds it looks like it's supposed to clip in place, but one of the clips is bent, so coffee grinds can get between the plastic and the upper part of the ring. Overall, it seems like a design flaw on how that ring is designed."

It does the job, though I still grind some \"fines.\" I know if one uses a French Press coffee-maker they are not supposed to gripe about grinds in your teeth, but I do.\n\nIt's easy to set to maximum grind size, and set the volume of grinds one wants. What I really like is that I can store un-ground beans in the top conical cavity and (for the most part) they don't draw Oxygen and water and grow stale. I didn't think this feature would work as well it does - better than storing coffee beans in bags and freezer bags.\n\nMy only drawback for this device is its price. I know, others opine that this is a bargain for a rotary burr grinder. But, the price is so far above that of the blade grinder that it just seems excessive. But, it does the job and I would buy another."

I am using it with a Technivorm drip coffee maker. But I have a problem. Like most of us, I am still trying to determine the proper amount of coffee beans to add, as well as the optimum time settings. So far I have been unsuccessful in determining the best settings for me. At first I added 4 1/2 oz of beans (including a pinch of salt to retard bitterness) to the hopper, with the timer set to 10 seconds. I added enough water for 1/2 pot of coffee. When the end product was too bitter I increased the time to 15 seconds, as suggested by some reviewers. No improvement.\n\nWhat annoys me is the fact that when I follow the exact same procedures with pre-ground coffee vice coffee beans the end product results in almost no bitterness. So I assume my problem is with the grinder settings.\n\nI have another issue with the grinder. Many people pour more beans into the hopper than they will need at any one time. The unused beans will be used at another time. For myself, I prefer to add the exact amount of beans that will be necessary at that particular time. I find that, when the grinding is completed, I still have some residual grounds residing in the grinder. Does this indicate an error on my part? Are 100% of the beans supposed to be utilized, indicating a perfect match of coffee measurement and grinding time? Should I start the grinder again to dispense the remaining grounds into the ground coffee container, should I increase the time setting to allow all the excess grounds to empty into the dispenser, or should I just discard the excess grounds?"

We needed to up our coffee game in prior to our newborn, as all parents can relate. Since 2012, we have used it multiple times a day, almost every day. We have NEVER waited any significant amount of time between grinding before pushing the button a second time. Our unit has continued to work and work and work and has never shown us any issue whatsoever. Solidly reliable.\n\nI'm not sure what washing the \"catcher\" is good for, exactly, but we still do it on occasion. Washing seems pointless for the following reasons: (1) The hopper seems to accumulate plenty of coffee residue, and we rarely clean it (as it is so rarely empty). (2) The burrs seem impossible to clean well, so we almost never do that, either. (3) The chute in the interior of the unit (below the burrs but above the \"catcher\") is almost impossible to clean, as it is virtually inaccessible. I smack the side of the unit to encourage \"stuck\" coffee grounds down the chute and into the \"catcher\" regularly, but that's about it.\n\nPros:\n- Reliable workhorse\n- Produces a consistent grind quality & size\n- Stylish design looks nice on the countertop\n- Glass \"catcher\" feels like high quality\n\nCons:\n- Loud enough to wake the dead. Or your babies while they are sleeping, as it has done for ours.\n- Plastic hopper seems to get greasy quickly, and does not feel like high quality. Most of the rest of the unit is hard to clean, if you'd want to.\n- Lid hard to close completely\n- Coffee flecks still manage to get everywhere when removing the carafe. Mysteriously, random coffee flecks build up beneath the unit.\n\nIf ours ever breaks (god forbid), we'd buy it again, mostly because ours has been so reliable."

It can get pretty small grind- almost there.\nOverall, it works well, nice sized hopper. My only gripe is the tiny start/stop button, and the reversed On/Off button. Please make a 'start' button i can find BEFORE making coffee. duh! And one must hit that thing 7 times before it goes, regardless of the laws of nature- it just wants you to keep jamming on that tiny button till it goes.\nfor the power toggle - Here in 'merica we flip UP for on, get with the program 'rest-of-the-world'. jeez. Flip that thing in the same factory location where you put the 110v household plugs and the steering wheels on the left."

Calling the folks at Bodum was a total waste of time .. I'm being kind when I say that they were totally incompetent. End of story .. I returned unit to Amazon for a full credit and bought another burr grinder [different brand altogether] at a local store."

The static is less though not quite gone. The new timer is a little more useful than the older model though I wish there was a way to bypass it completely. I also like the smaller footprint and overall look. With all that in mind, for the money I'm thrilled with this grinder."

            "reviewText": "This is a stylish and well-designed grinder capable of delivering everything from medium drip grinds to super-fine espresso powder. It's a little louder than expected, but maybe that's because it's the first big noise of each day. As advertised, the borosilicate glass seems to keep static manageable, and the coffee tastes even better with the knowledge that we got as good a grinder as some of the fancier Italian models, and at half the price.\n\nWe've had one problem that revealed a technical vulnerability of this grinder (and of burr grinders generally) but also showcased some excellent customer service at Bodum. A small pebble was in with the coffee beans -- this apparently happens occasionally -- and jammed the mechanism. The grinder stopped as it should have (it has a self-protection mechanism) but the pebble was REALLY wedged in tightly ... and a clumsy technician (me) broke an internal plastic retaining ring while dis- and re-assembling the gizmo. Although the grinder could still be used, the burr surfaces were no longer being held in alignment and it sounded unhappy.\n\nA phone call to Bodum made it all better. They took our name and address and shipped us a replacement part without charge, despite the fact that the retaining ring comes with the machined-metal burr already attached. (Meaning: This was NOT a cheap part to have sent to us gratis, and they were generous to have done so.) This saved everyone the cost of shipping and kept us limping along -- but able to make coffee! -- while the part was in transit. Call us very satisfied customers."

I used that grinder upwards 4 -5 times a day, it still worked but the burrs are getting dull and the front plastic piece that holds the grinds catcher snapped off.\n\nObviously with such good results I went with another Bodum grinder, this time I opted for the Copper (aluminum body copper colored) over the Rubberized Black one that I have previously. The rubberized body is quit impossible to keep clean everything stuck to it and I had to end up covering with a huge zip-loc bag to keep it from looking like a lint brush :/\nI'm not sure if it's becuase it's newer, the metal body, or some kinda of revision...this new copper model is a lot quieter and seems they have sped it up a bit over the first model I had. I always worry if the grinder is too fast it could scorch the beans but so far, so good. I do also notice more static over my old model, so after grinding I don't pull the catcher out immediately. Being glass I wasn't expecting so much static, my old one didn't do this.\n\nThe Bad: Even though this has a metal body, the bottom and most import part is still cheapy plastic..I'm not sure what they where thinking with this design. Obviously if someone is paying more for a metal body they want durability.\nI just worry about it breaking in the future like my previous Bodum, I still used it for last year and a half 2 years just had to keep taping the bottom back together."

For what I use it for... its hard to tell the difference between the two grinders. Theoretically there is less dust with my more expensive grinder, but I can't really tell the difference. The one big issue is for chemex and french press coffee the grinds still end up pretty small; the coarse setting isn't nearly coarse enough. I haven't tried the fine settings with the Bodum, but I imagine I'll have less control.\n\nPros:\n- It grinds coffee!\n- Has a bunch of different grind settings\n- This is the best low end burr grinder I was able to find.\n- Aesthetically pleasing\n- Reasonably compact\n\nCons:\n- I'd only grind coffee with these; I destroyed one trying to grind flax seeds. The flax seeds gummed up the works and I threw it out in frustration.\n- While it looks nice, and works great, you are getting a grinder for around a hundred bucks... the quality isn't as nice as the multi-hundred units out there. On the other hand, if you're used to the push grinders, this one is a HUGE upgrade.\n- Grinds on a timer; if you have a lot of coffee you have to keep resetting it and running it again. However, you likely shouldn't do this as they warn in the manual that they have the timer to avoid burning out the motor.\n\nI like it, and am glad I bought it."

There are quite a few grounds on my counter top. I found one way to limit this problem is to \"burp\" the machine by gently slapping it on each side of the motor housing. This helped to clear the burrs and dump the left over grounds into the glass jar and release the static electricity. The quality of the grinder is first rate. The flying grounds are a minor inconvenience. I also turn off the toggle switch after each use. This way I can run the machine for 20 sec. twice to grind the amount of coffee I need. Leaving the toggle switch on creates heat in the motor, thus the recommendation to wait between grinding intervals. I've done this for months now and have had no problem with the motor overheating. You will save energy costs by not leaving the toggle on."

After that it seemed to run ok but would take 3 twenty second grind intervals to grind enough coffee for my morning coffee. I returned it to Amazon for a refund and purchased a Capresso.

It's the only burr grinder I've had, so I don't have much to compare it to. I really like timed grind feature. I just give the start button a quick press each morning and it shuts off after 10 seconds. I also like the large hopper.\n\nIt's louder than the Baratza grinder, but that's not much of a con because it's only on 10 seconds a day.\n\nUnfortunately, the glass catcher only lasted a little over a year. I normally give it a knock on the bottom -- with my knuckles -- to get the bulk of the remaining grinds out. One morning that was too much for it and it broke. Also, it's not much of a negative, but the plastic cover fits too loosely on the catcher.\n\nI'd buy it again, but be careful with the glass catcher."

OBVIOUSLY it's next to a heat source. how else am i supposed to make coffee? also, you can do something about it... lots of elbow grease.\n\n2. once you put beans in you are instructed not to change the grind setting. bad design if you ask me.\n\n3. you are instructed not to grind for too long otherwise you will burn out the motor. this is fine if you only grind for one cup. there are alternative grinders in the same price range that do better than this one and do not have this limitation so why would you buy this one?\n\n4. this unit get clogged more easily than i think it should. subjective on my part. turns out grinding rice is the trick but if you didnt know that it's a big pain to clean the innards because it's hard to reach inside.\n\n5. after you remove the container, leftover grinds fall to the bottom. messy."

Depending on the size of the pot of coffee that you are making this may not be enough time to grind all of the beans that you need. 2.) The ground beans have a lot of static and so as a result, it is quite messy."

I certainly don't plan on spending >$100/year for a grinder. Then contacted Bodum@brandprotectplus.com. Sent photos of the broken gears etc etc - never received a response.

I hate that, but there are no other products out there to chose from.\n\nThe best coffee grinder on Amazon is the Kitchenaid burr grinder, which has both the top and bottom parts made out of glass. But it doesn't have a grinding timer and costs $250. So really there are no good grinders on the market. This is the closest thing to a good coffee grinder."

As such, I paid attention to the manual that advises to wait between grinding sessions for cooldown.\n\nUnfortunately, 6 months ago I first heard the plastic gears start stripping. Today it is finally all of the way gone. It has lasted me just under 2 years -- what I would estimate to be 500 grinds. That'll give you about $0.15 per grind and a busted machine that you throw away at the end."

Operation is simple and the grinds are of good quality for whatever setting you select. Cleaning the various parts is easy, to clean the machine itself I use a small watercolor brush to get into the nooks and crannies around the grinder and the chute where the grinds exit. A few short bursts of my breath during this process helps get most particles out, along with gentle taps to the sides and top/bottom of the unit. The glass catcher is great, as others have said it reduces messes due to static charge, plus being glass it is perfect for sealing with plastic wrap which clings to the container's sides easily. I've been grinding enough for 4-5 cups to use throughout the day (I brew one cup at time in my Keurig using the filter basket) so keeping the grinds fresh in the container using plastic wrap is simple. Finally the soft rubber ring around the container and the soft nubs on the machine body are a nice touch, this design gives you a little extra grip where you need it most while handling and cleaning."

Another downside is that max amount of coffee it can grind in one setting is 20 sec (a couple of tablespoons). To avoid motor overheating after a full 20 sec grind the unit is supposed to cool down for at least 3 min before the next cycle. Receiving container is made of glass with a flimsy rubber lid. The upper loading container is made of plastic with again flimsy plastic cover. It is going back to the seller."

It's a fairly easy fix, you have to take it apart and push the coffee out with a toothpick or something, but it's a hassle. No problem as long as you make sure the cup is perfectly centered each time you grind."

The melted part of the lid seemed to turn gooey, so I cut it with scissors so I could use the grinder until I could get a new lid from Bodum. Well, surprise! They don't sell them, and according to their customer service, they never will.\n\nSo now this sits in my cabinet. Without that lid, grounds go all over the counter.

The next one I received had all the parts, but when I turned it on the motor came on but the grinder didn't move or work at all. Not to mention, the pieces have a lot of plastic in the mechanism, not sure how it would have lasted long term. Returned it again and getting a refund instead. Very disappointed Bodum..."

            "reviewText": "I have researched these things for hours before deciding to buy this unit. Here are my findings:\n\nThere are three units that were in the running (ordered by price):\n\na. Bodum Bistro Electric Burr Coffee Grinder (the unit on this page and the one I ultimately bought and am very happy with) - $89.99\nb.\u00a0Breville BCG800XL Smart Grinder\u00a0- $199.99\nc.\u00a0Rancilio ROCKY Rancilio Burr Grinder with Doser\u00a0- $359.99\n\nNow, if price is not an issue, by all means go with the Breville BCG800XL (really can't go wrong with that one). Also, notice that all of these are burr grinders (blade grinders are NOT the way to go) and all are excellent machines; all other machines researched under $400 have serious drawbacks - trust me - I've done the research.\n\nOkay, now let's take a look at each one.\n\n--- a.\u00a0Bodum Bistro Electric Burr Coffee Grinder, Black\u00a0- this is an excellent unit all around and the one I bought:\n\n-- Grind:\nVery consistent and perfect size for drip on drip setting; I have tried this with a drip coffee maker and it is excellent. Some say that it can't quite match the best machines out there for a cappuccino grind (i.e. very very very fine for very very picky machines) but I do not have a cappuccino machine and so this does not really concern me all that much.\n\n-- Mess:\nAwesome, no mess at all. The glass catcher reduces the static on the grinds so that they do not jump (no idea how some complain about mess); no mess here.\nAfter catcher is removed, no excess coffee spills out.\n\n-- Noise:\nNot very loud at all; I thought it would be louder. Two scaredy cats in my house and both did not even wake up (same room as the appliance).\n\n-- Cleanup:\nSuper easy; just rinse the catcher and you are done.\n\n-- Features:\nTimer -> 5-20 second; set it once, and it stays from grind to grind. 10 seconds was perfect for my mug (4 cups).\n\n-- Build Quality:\nExcellent all around with a glass catcher and plastic hopper. The burrs are very well machined.\n\n-- Looks/Size:\nThe machine is on the small size but very good looking (I have a black one).\n\n-- Cons:\nMotor \"should\" (at least that is what the manual recommends) rest for 5 minutes before every 20 second grind. Really, for me, this is not an issue as 20 seconds produces about 6-8 cups of medium strength coffee.\nBean hopper is not tinted so leaving beans in it (especially in the light) may not be a great idea but you should not leave beans in the hopper in any case as suggested by all of the other machine's manuals.\nSome claim that very very fine cappuccino grinds are not acceptable for very picky cappuccino machines; go figure.\nAdjusting the grind size can only be done with the motor running (or so claims the manual). Not a big deal for me since I do not plan to adjust it ... well ... ever after the initial setting (doesn't have to have beans in it but just running motor while adjusting).\n\n--- b.\u00a0Breville BCG800XL Smart Grinder\u00a0- if money is not an issue, why not - I could find really nothing wrong with it except the price.\n\n-- Grind:\nFrom doing much research, this thing really gets it right for anything you want; even the pickiest cappuccino machines like this thing. French press is also no problem.\n\n-- Mess:\nNo mess; static is eliminated by their special technology that slows the coffee grinds before they get to the catcher.\n\n-- Noise:\nVery quite.\n\n-- Cleanup:\nCannot comment on cleanup but people have said that it is not a problem.\n\n-- Features:\nBuilt in doser - very nice; will auto grind correct amount based on your cup and strength setting.\nNice LCD screen.\nBean hopper is tinted.\n\n-- Build Quality:\nCustomers claim that it is very solid and well built.\n\n-- Looks/Size:\nLooks very nice.\n\n-- Cons:\nPrice.\n\n--- c.\u00a0Rancilio ROCKY Rancilio Burr Grinder with Doser\u00a0- if you want the best, this is it for a reasonable price (reasonable to some, all depends).\n\nSpecs:\nI am not going to go into detail about this one but needless to say that those very serious about their cappuccino grind, etc. and for whom money is no issue should probably get this machine. Frankly, for this much money, I see no reason.\n\nConclusion:\n- The Bodum Bistro Electric Burr Coffee Grinder is an excellent all around machine with very minor (at least to me) drawbacks and if one is to consider the price/performance ratio, simply cannot be beat. Best of luck and hope this review saves some hours of research."

The problem is I waited to use it for 10 months after purchase because my Cuisinart was still working (with problems) when I bought this so the warranty period was over.

One look at the burr, and boy I don't want to be a coffee bean tangled in that thing.\n\nThe instructions are completely useless. There's virtually no help on how to assemble the machine. Fortunately it's easy enough to figure out. But, when I went to turn it on--nothing. Power light was on, I fiddled with every possible setting and reinstalled the hopper several times, but no worky. Hoped to find something I missed in the manual, maybe there is something in Icelandic but definitely not in English. So it goes back, and I hope the replacement won't be a POS too.\n\nBig disappointment.\n\nUpdate: I received a replacement, this one works. I still think it's the best option for the price. The glass cup really does a lot to prevent the static charge that scatters grounds everywhere. Grounds seem much more evenly sized compared to my old Krups grinder, and they don't clog the filter in my drip machine anymore. The timer is a joke, as the number of seconds around the dial do not correspond to real time. I have developed a feel for where to set the dial according to how many cups. If you are making more than about 8 cups you will need to press the grind button a second time to get enough grounds.\n\nSo, it has some quirks, but I'm happy with it.\n\nUpdate two: After a year, it takes far longer to grind. Grinds for 2 cups takes 30 seconds, about 3 times longer than it used to, which means a full pot of coffee requires me to press the button 3-4 times. I cleaned every part of the thing, even using a brush in the inner passages, but the only thing I can figure is that the burr has become dull. I've only used it once or twice a day."

Perhaps that is a user issue.\n\nFor it not to be messy you have to take the glass container and the lid and clean them out after each time you use them. You also have to wipe down the bottom of the grinder to get any coffee that may have spilled out when you removed the container.\n\nThese are not egregious tasks but remain beyond the average male.\n\nAlso you have to turn it off after you use it so you do not continue to waste electricity."

As I tried to adjust for a perfect espresso shot from my Breville 800ESXL, the water flowed through the grinds too fast, no matter how hard I tamped down the grinds. It gets VERY close to the fine grind needed, but just not quite fine enough. I'm so disappointed!!\nI guess I have to buy a burr grinder that includes a Turkish coffee setting (which I have never tried to make), so that I can have the latitude to bring the grind to its correct size.\n\nI would be curious to know if other people have had the same experience, or maybe I just got one that happened to be calibrated slightly incorrectly. Now I am considering buying a Capresso grinder, which is not as beautifully designed, and has more plastic, but maybe it will get the grinding done correctly for espresso.\n\nUpdate: I purchased, and am loving, for all espresso grinds:\u00a0Capresso 565 Infinity Conical Burr Grinder, Stainless Steel"

Coffee stays in the grind holder from the static electricity, when you go to clean the unit up, there is coffee sticking to everything, when you think you have it clean and set it down, coffee falls down out of the grinder after the static electricity becomes less. Just plain messy, Is a good unit if you like Fine/Fine ground coffee and cleaning up a ground coffee mess for 20 minutes after each use. Not impressed at all for the money spent on this unit, think I will buy another cuisinart and only grind 1 pound at a time. I could almost by 3 of those for what I paid for this thing, Must add, Amazon is a awesome store to shop at, always great service."

After extricating the offending bean from the mechanism (this is a coffee grinder, right?) the grinder began making a terrible noise (clearly malfunctioning).

He hates that aspect of it, though he says the flavor of the milled beans is good, albeit not wildly better than fresh ground.

            "reviewText": "I purchased this burr grinder based on the reviews, price point and look - which I really love. My coffee of choice is French or Pot Press - for me it brings out the best flavor and full body and I love a big mug each morning, usually a darker roast. The problem is the coarsest setting from this machine is still too small to make great French Press - see my pictures showing the largest ground size from this grinder vs the coarse setting on a supermarket grinder set to Coarse. That picture shows the average size of the Bodum is roughly half that of the standard size coarse grind.\n\nFor French Press here's the thing. First, we all know to start with good, nearly boiling, water and freshly ground, quality beans. The rest is in the preparation - the ratio of water to beans, size of the ground, and steep time make a huge difference in the taste. To get that full flavor takes time but too much time makes for a bitter cup. A small grind needs less time to avoid the bitterness. For myself it took close to week, reworking my recipe once each morning until I got a cup good enough that I wanted to finish but none have come close to the best French Press brew I've tasted with the same beans. My longer 4, sometimes 5 minute total time resulted in a bitter taste. Reducing the time too much give a weak taste so changing the ratio of water to beans will help compensate. I pretty much have that finally worked out now using 3 - 3 1/2 minutes time before it turns bitter but the body is a bit less than what I learned to love. A coarser ground and about 4 minutes or so would do the trick but the coarsest setting is not that coarse - see my customer pictures.\n\nAside for that I do love this grinder, the design, including the glass receptacle - which is much better than plastic for static, the ease or use... and it does make a very nice fine grind - for that I give it 5 stars. However, if you are looking for a burr grinder that does coarse grinding for French Press then look further since for that I give it only 1 star. I will likely return it since my morning cup/mug is not as special as it used to be. That said, the best affordable replacement for my needs is not obvious - my research frequently turns up comments like `most inexpensive burr grinders don't do well for French Press.'"

And sometimes pushing the grind button does nothing. So you have to keep twisting the bean holder to get it to grind again, and then it only will grind for a few seconds. Very frustrating. Not to mention that the grinds end up all over your counter, and you are forced to clean every element of the machine after every use, or else the grinds will be everywhere."

We even tried spray oiling it and even rubbing static sheets on it with suggestion from forums. Nothing worked.

            "reviewText": "This is a really nice burr grinder with plusses (++) and some noteworthy minuses (--).\n\n++ Very quiet operation when compared to two other burr grinders I've had. Very important if you don't like loud noise in the morning.\n++ Does a good job producing evenly-sized grounds. No big chunks of beans get through. The consistency of the grind seems to produce more consistency in the brewed coffee, at least in my experience.\n++ The hopper lid has a silicone ring that creates a seal. This might be a factor in how quiet the grinder is, but is possibly for keeping beans stored int he hopper fresh. I typically do not store beans in the hopper, but I suppose this ring could make that a possibility since it would limit the amount of air the beans are in contact with.\n++ Easy to set up and use.\n++ Attractive enough to keep out on counter.\n\n-- The grounds container is small. If you are grinding enough coffee to brew a big pot of coffee (8-10 cups), you will have to empty the cup halfway through the amount of beans needed for that. This is the biggest drawback, imo.\n-- The grounds container is narrow. I can't fit two of my coffee measuring scoops into it and have to pour the grou0nds into them. It's a bit messy to do that because of the next point.\n-- The grounds container is very static-prone. This makes pouring the grinds out of it a little trickier than it should be. The status may abate somewhat over time, but initially there is more static than usual and it causes some of the grinds to go AWOL when pouring them out and also to stick to the grinder.\n\n+- It's difficult to read the grind level indicator. You rotate the red ring under the bean hopper to choose how coarse or fine you want the grind to be, but the indicators for those grinds are in raised icons and hashes on the ring, so you have to be in the right light for that to be visible. If you consistently use the same grind, this is not a problem. But if you change grinds depending on what coffeemaker you are using, you are either going to have to get a feel for this or put the grinder in a place where you can see the markings.\n+- The initial product description says there is a timer. There is not. That is fine with me since I prefer not to keep beans in the hopper and grind only what I intend to use at the time.\n\nThe Bottom Line: Even with the minuses, I prefer this grinder over the others I've had primarily because of the lack of noise. I really hate loud noise in the morning and noise this grinder makes is very tolerable. The consistency of the grind is also very good and I think that contributes to better brewing. The small capacity of the container may be the biggest problem for those who brew large pots of coffee."

I love that the grind settings are easy to change. I do not store beans in the hopper, but in a cabinet in an airtight container. We've moved three times since owning it and the grinder has held up wonderfully to movers tossing it about. I brush it out probably three times a year using a straw cleaner. I bought this after returning a grinder that was double the price because of annoying static cling. This grinder's glass container doesn't have that problem.

I think proper setup is crucial to make sure you don't prematurely wear/stress components, especially some of the plastic ones surrounding the steel burrs.\n\nThe actual metal components are hefty and durable, I've noticed no change in performance over nearly four years. But the burrs sit in white plastic fittings that feel a little fragile. They also only fit in one way, though they look like they would fit a couple of different ways. I still get confused when I remove things to clean them, which you will need to do every few months to keep everything moving smoothly. The hopper comes off the top, which acts as a tensioner on the \"male\" part of the burr, which sits atop the \"female\" part. Those two components need to have the dust and grit cleaned off and for the male section to be set back the correct way. There are two small lugs which look the same to my eyes, but one lug is apparently different than the other. As I mentioned, if you assemble it the wrong way the grind will be way off (way too fine for brewing coffee). Unfortunately it requires a bit of re-cleaning to reassemble it.\n\nThis grinder definitely requires a little bit of patience. If you're careful, though, it will obviously last well beyond the time that I have had it. The styling is certainly a high point. We have the lime green model and it looks classy and unique."

            "reviewDate": "December 29, 2016",
            "reviewText": "I received the Bodum Bistro Burr Grinder as a gift, and it's my second burr grinder - the other being the Capresso Infinity I use in my office. Between the two, I think the Capresso is a better overall product, BUT the Bodum retails for about $20 to $30 cheaper, is relatively compact, and seems to get the job done nicely.\n\nIf you're bothering to read a review of an electric burr grinder on Amazon, you probably already know that a quality, consistent grind is right up there with water quality and temperature as the most important things you can control in brewing a perfect cup of coffee. Steel blade grinders, while cheap and small, tend to pulverize and heat coffee grounds. While maybe 60% of them look to be properly-shaped coffee grounds, the variation in grind size and particularly the pulverized powder/dust generated by blade grinders will result in a bitter brew, more often than not. That's where a quality conical burr grinder can help, and the Bodum is arguably the most affordable genuine electrical conical burr grinder on the mass market.\n\nI believe it has roughly a dozen different grind size settings, which is a few less than the Capresso Inifinity, and significantly less than the Baratza Encore (which is a partial step up in quality from the other two, from what I hear). But I find that it does a passable job at covering the range from fine grinds to a coarser setting you'd use from a steeping method like French Press or maybe AeroPress.\n\nThe Bodum Bistro operates differently than the Capresso in that it has both a timer and an on/off button. Actually, the Bodum allows you to shut off the grinder at any time by pressing the button again. Otherwise, it runs for the length of time you set it at. While this is a slightly higher degree of control than the Capresso, I don't find that it adds much of benefit. The key for both machines is how long they hold up, and I haven't had either long enough to know the answer yet. But the Bodum seems to be solidly built for its price point.\n\nOne thing I read in countless reviews was that the glass receptacle of the Bodum was larger and less static-prone than the other grinders, but I haven't found this to be the case. In fact, it seems like it attracts more grinds than my Capresso, though it is easier to wipe out given it is a perfect cylinder with no jagged shapes to navigate. The inner gear mechanism is decently easy to remove and clean out, though it is very hard to clean thoroughly, even with a long handle soft brush (which I recommend, as it does not come with one).\n\nThe upper collection bin for receiving whole beans opens up wide like a funnel for convenience. This is nice for adding beans, but also adds to the storage size of the device, which is otherwise quite compact. If noise level matters to you (in an office or home setting), I do think that the Capresso is notably quieter than the Bodum, though it's a minor gripe.\n\nI'm generally happy with the Bodum Bistro Burr Grinder. The only reason I'm rating it 4 stars is that I felt like the grind consistency is not quite as good as similarly-priced devices, and it isn't quite as easy to clean and maintain as I'd anticipated. But it's good see a decent conical burr grinder well below the $100 price point.\n\nUPDATE (04/10/17): Definitely standing by my 4-star review. By and large, it's a great value. The top coffee gear review sites seem to agree that this is the most affordable burr grinder that more or less produces burr-grinder consistency. That being said, the more that I use the Bodum versus my Capresso Infinity at the office, the more clear it is to me that the Infinity is noticeably better. And that's me noticing both a visual and a taste difference despite being relatively new to this stuff. So, if you really need to save another $25, or you end up with a Bodum Bistro as a gift, don't fret - it's a good machine. But, ideally, given the choice of picking between all the options in this price tier, I think there are some better options.\n\nUPDATE (06/26/17): Rating unchanged, but I have figured out over time that my particular Bodum Bistro burr grinder requires a much coarser setting than corresponds to the pictures on the grinder and suggestions in the manual. I was getting a lot of bitter/overextracted brews initially, but I now use a setting of 2.5 or 3 \"dots\" to the right of the center \"drip\" position, and a full 4 \"dots\" to the right for Chemex, which requires a medium-coarse grind. All grinders vary from unit to unit, and you just need to experiment with yours, starting with settings that are too coarse and working your way finer until happy. Still prefer the Capresso Inifinity to this model by a fair margin, but much happier with the Bodum after finding the proper settings."

I had the original one in black, purchased in 2014 and it has functioned for 3 years, with at least every-other-day use without issue. Unfortunately I lost it in my last breakup, as my partner had also grown extremely fond of it and wanted to hang onto it. I am now purchasing the new aluminum (chrome) version.\n\nIMPORTANT. Please note that this is a CONICAL burr grinder. Burr grinders are NOT made the same. A mechanical/FLAT burr grinder is essentially USELESS for making fine grind for ESPRESSO. This is therefore, the CHEAPEST, highest quality CONICAL burr grinder for the money. It has very nice touches, such as the glass catcher, which is essentially much better than all of the competition because plastic has a magnetic draw to coffee grind and it is very difficult to empty out the coffee you grind. It is also annoying to have to frequently clean a plastic catcher. Having all of the grains come nicely out of this glass receptacle is very nice since you don't have to rinse/clean it as often. The silicone top of the hopper is also reassuring that less air gets in and degrades/oxidizes the beans that sit there for days to weeks. Competitors hoppers have a PLASTIC top that does NOT seal air out as well.\n\nDo your research, this is hands down the best conical burr grinder you can find in the $100 range."

But turning it down close to the finer espresso grind caused the motor to emit a high pitched whine and the feeding of beans to, um, grind to a halt.\n\nNo amount of cajoling could get the beans to feed again. I took it apart and cleaned it only to have it happen again. Only dropping the beans into the hopper a few at a time by hand seemed to work. This, of course, doesn't grind fast enough to get enough to fill the espresso filter in one \"session\" so multiple grinding (with sometimes a 5 minute wait between) is needed.\n\nTo be fair, this MAY be attributed to the very oily Starbucks espresso beans. But, IMHO, a good grinder should be able to deal with such beans. I will update my review though as I find out more (only on my second grind attempt).\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUPDATE: After using now a little over 2 months, and running several pounds of beans through, I can say that I really like it. It took a little patience at first but once it broke in, it feeds really well now. Even new and oily Starbucks beans it grinds well. Took a little to find the exact setting that my espresso machine liked but now it's consistent, easy to use, and not too messy."

Glass reservoir is a nice alternative to static inducing plastic. Very consistent grind quality throughout setting range, a huge strong point of this grinder.\n\nNegatives: Holds at least Tbs of grounds that get trapped within burr chamber, and dumps on counter when you pull out the glass reservoir. Annoying. If the feed went straight through to the cup below it would be far less. Needs a sharp rap on the side to help shake it free so it drops into the glass cup.\nThe rubbery red coating on mine is now tacky and sticky and feels gross.

I recommend it because it does a great job, but you need to know a few things:\n\nI have always observed the 5 minute wait between 20sec grinds. It needs this because heat builds up inside during the grind an it needs to cool back down. Harder beans or finer grinds will make it heat up more.\n\nI use Sam's Club whole bean coffee which is quite oily. It does make the grounds tend to stick and a little messy after the grind, but not a big deal. Gently tapping the glass Coffee Catcher and lid after a grind reduces static sticking.\n\nAs far as cleaning, I marked the setting for my drip grind and clean the burrs a few times a year. Otherwise it's just a wipe with a paper towel. I have never had a clog, and would never grind rice to clean it because rice is quite hard."

Before I had a Hario hand grinder which worked great if you don't mind taking the time to grind your beans by hand.\nFrom my point of view, this product does have both positives and negatives.\nPositives: I love the look and the size, as well, as the amount of beans it can fit in the hopper. Also, as it's a timed grinder, I appreciate that they give you a guide on the underside of the lid to tell you how much ground coffee your going to need and at what setting. Speaking of, it's incredibly easy to change the grind setting. Just turn the hopper to change the grind setting. I also like the glass, hand blown ground container which the coffee gets ground into.\nNegatives: in my review there's really only one and I hear that Bodum has done what they can to mitigate the problem. That is the static electricity which causes the grounds to stick to the container after grinding. I've heard it's worse with plastic receptacles so that's why they've decided to use a glass container. Plus, the glass container just looks nicer, more of a quality product.\nAnd one thing which I just thought of, it is a little noisy, but as I read reviews before purchase, I've heard this is a quieter one than average.\nAll in all, a great product. Would definitely purchase again."

            "reviewDate": "January 14, 2011",
            "reviewText": "There's a lot to like about this burr grinder. First, the design is stylish and it feels like it's very well-made. The surface has a rubberized feel so it's easy to grip or move around without slipping. It's bigger than the typical blade grinder, but is still compact enough that it doesn't take up too much counter space. The lids seal well on the coffee bean grinder and the ground coffee holder. I've been using it for about a month with a variety of whole bean coffees and have noticed a positive difference in flavor. I'd say the true flavor of the coffee comes through stronger than with my blade grinder. Especially with the finer grind settings, such as espresso. It can grind the coffee into superfine powder and the taste is amazing. It grinds a little quieter than the typical blade grinder which is a nice feature. There's a hidden cord-wrap on the bottom of the base so you can hide most of the electrical cord. A little detail, but helpful. There were a few issues I've found that made me give it 4 stars instead of 5, despite the great tasting coffee I've been enjoying. Like others mentioned, the instruction manual says to you need to let the motor rest for 5 minutes in between 20 second grinding sessions to prevent overheating. If you're someone just grinding enough coffee for a few cups, this shouldn't be a problem, but if you're grinding more, obviously it takes more time because you're waiting in between grinding sessions. The manual also mentions that you have to empty the coffee bean container after grinding for 20 seconds in order to prevent the motor from overheating. Again, this will be another step if you grind more than enough coffee for a few cups. For a coffee grinder that looks so big and sturdy, I guess I'd expected it would be able to handle grinding more coffee easily at one time. Since I don't usually grind all that much at once, it hasn't been too much of an inconvenience but for someone who plans to grind enough for 8-12 cups or more, it could getting a little annoying having to wait for 5 minutes between each 20 second session. Still, I'm happy with this grinder because my coffee tastes better than ever and I like having the convenience of the automatic settings that do course, medium or fine grind."

Of course one can pay a lot more for a very high quality machine, but for a budget burr grinder I think this is pretty great!"

            "reviewText": "I was not expecting much for the price. If you are torn between a basic blade grinder and the higher-end coffee grinders that cost several hundred dollars, then I would highly recommend considering this unit.\n\nI almost exclusively make espresso-based coffee drinks and have done so for over 10 years. I would never consider using a blade grinder. The grind is just too inconsistent. Also, I have yet to find one of the commercial \"in-store\" grinders to produce a satisfactory grind no matter what the setting. Not wanting to spend several hundred on a top-rated burr grinder, I had to try different pre-ground coffees such as Peet's, Illy, and Lavazza (which are excellent coffees BTW) and are offered in espresso grinds. Still the grind was never just right.\n\nSo, along comes this inexpensive Bodum burr grinder, and I am making the finest, most consistent coffee grinds I have ever experienced. And, it comes a a terrific price. The burrs are conical steel and do an excellent job. I don't know how long they will last or how long it will take before they go out of calibration, so I can't speak for long-term durability. Disassembling it and reading the manual do not indicate any adjustment or replaceable parts.\n\nThe unit comes with a somewhat rubberized coating which helps it avoid looking/feeling cheap. The parts seem sturdy enough, and the hopper lid seals surprisingly well. The grounds container is glass with a silicone lid with a hole in it that seals against the grinder chamber. A first nit is that there is no separate cover, so you can't remove the jar and just keep that around if you still have coffee grounds left. (I typically pull 8-16 espresso shots throughout the day.) Thus, the grinder takes up permanent counter space. However, I am the type, whether it's a mixer, a soda maker, a blender, a juicer, or most other appliances, to try and put it away after use. The best compromise I've found is to transfer the grinds to another sealed container for short-term use.\n\nThe only major flaw I can find (outside of unknown long-term durability which can be considered fair in any case due to its low price) is the 20 second grinder limitation. According to the very terse manual, after running it for 20 seconds, you should let it rest for 5 minutes to cool off. Similar \"Engrish\" instructions say, \"Warning: [...] Empty the coffee bean container [not the grounds container] after every grinding operation (20 seconds) to avoid overheating the motor.\" This does not make much sense and seems overly restrictive. I have ignored both these warnings and just used common sense. You can run the 20 second timer over and over for any length you desire by pressing the start/stop button. This whole notion seems a bit flawed and costs it a star.\n\nThere is also a section to wind the cord around inside the base to minimize the excess cord flopping around which is a nice touch. So far, I am quite impressed with this product, especially considering its price. It is smart-looking and lightweight so you can put it away if you want to."

I've had this grinder for about 6 months... I use it every couple weeks to grind my home-roasted coffee beans. It's the best grinder I've used... only complaint is that the plasticy-rubber lid collects static... so the the grinds and the husk bits can go jumping when you pull the glass catcher. I use the grinds for my french press and also in my Keurig, using the \"My K-Cup\"... works wonderfully. Make sure to read the instruction booklet... it helped.\n\nA few tips I've been learning along the way:\n\n1. Put the grinder and everything on a cookie sheet when you're going to grind... that'll contain any spillage, dust, and bean grinds that go ballistic.\n\n2. Go to one of those big-box home stores and get the 97 cent, one inch bristle paint brush. It really gets in the nooks of the burr assembly to get out the stuck grinds. Just be careful as the metal part of the brush can scratch the plastic.\n\n3. Grind half a hopper of uncooked white rice through the grinder every two weeks, or so, to keep the innards of the chute and assembly free of grinds. The fresher the coffee, the more oily the beans are, so you have to be diligent to keep things from getting gummed up where the brush can't reach.\n\n4. You mileage may vary, but for my french press, the coarsest setting works brilliantly. And, for he beans I run through my Keurig, using the \"My K-Cup\", one setting finer than the little vacuum-press symbol is perfect.\n\nNo complaints, thus far. I only use it every couple weeks, so it's not heavily used... and I also read the direction booklet. But, for the money, it's the best burr grinder out there."

Drip pot grind is nice and French press does well, too.\n\nThe hopper holds a good portion of beans with an air tight seal.\n\nIt's pretty compact on my counter.\n\nAnd the most important- Better tasting coffee with grounds are even size and texture for steeping. I've started using less beans in the same pot size with no loss of taste.\n\nCons:\nIt's not quiet but for 20 seconds at a time I'm okay with it. If you're used to a blade grinder and it's pulse this will make you take notice.\n\nLike others said the grind timer is a bit short. 5 seconds will give you about 7 grams (one cup of 6oz coffee). So if you do the math and brew 6-8 cups you'll need to wait 5 min. Not a deal breaker with me but something to mention.\n\nStatic free? No, but compared to my Black & Decker blade grinder it was pretty clean. Some grounds do come out of the glass jar but not enough for me to care. It's a kitchen and when you make good things you make a mess, duh!\n\nFinally, what last surprised me was the amount of vibration produced when grinding. I put the grinder on it's most coarse setting for a french press pot I wanted to brew only to have it vibrate enough to losen the hopper off the base and tripped a safety setting. Turning it one notch finer kept it locked.\n\n-----\n\nI roast my own coffee beans and so I've been pleased how a good grinder can make your roasting taste better. It's just one more step in controlling variables form bean to cup. Good bye, blade grinder! I guess now I need an espresso machine. Now where can I buy one of those...."

We are very happy so far and have found it to be the right solution for us.\n\nThe hopper holds a lot of coffee - not perfectly sealed but good enough - enough for two for 5 days or so. The controls allow for grind settings from coarse (press pot) to fine (espresso) with a variety of settings in between. There is a timer for up to 20 seconds of grind. It takes a few tries to find the right grind and the right time frame to get the perfect amount of coffee without measuring. We just grind and dump it now without scooping out and counting.\n\nIt may be important to note that the 20 second grind is as much as you can do and then Bodum recommends letting the motor 'cool' for a period of time before grinding again. This is important if you are trying to make a large pot or multiple pots and need a lot of coffee ground at one time.\n\nIn comparison to the traditional\u00a0Krups 203-42 Electric Coffee and Spice Grinder with Stainless-Steel blades, Black, this is half the noise level and offers a much more even grind. The coffee ends up in a glass container that is as static free as possible. Does coffee still cling to it? Sure, but it's not bad and it washes easily - although we don't wash it out every day.\n\nSo far, we are thrilled to have fresh ground coffee every morning without the hassle of scooping, counting, brushing, etc. A highly recommended purchase."

If you never really stopped to think about different types of grinds and their relationship to different ways of making coffee, then this may seem like overkill. The Bodum allows you to select varying levels of coarseness for your coffee; from very fine (typically used in espressos) to quite coarse (used in french press coffee), with numerous settings in between. This unit also has a timer, meaning that you can grind your coffee for an exact amount of time. This may seem useless to some, but to coffee enthusiasts, there is a big difference between a 10 and 15 second grind. This is all fine and good, but the bottom line is that the Bodum does an excellent job at grinding coffee. The design of this unit ensures that it remains cleaner than other grinders (no packed grounds at the bottom, like in other units), and it is exceptionally quiet. The grounds are cleanly deposited into the glass receptacle, ensuring no spills. Overall, this is a terrific little machine, and it looks great to boot!"

The design of the Bistro is better suited to deal with the staticy coffee grounds. My only issue is that it's a little stiff, when you try to turn the hopper to adjust the grind setting."

They claim this grinder's catch jar is a special anti-static glass that allows grind to slide right out without sticking. This not true. Not only do they stick to the inside, they somehow make their way to the outside after grinding. That's really the only bad thing about it though. I got this grinder because i like to make coffee different ways. I got rid of my coffee maker with built in burr grinder, picking up this guy and new drip maker. The great thing about this product is that it stores a good amount of beans and has a wide array of grind settings that allows you to make coffee anyway you like, from French press to espresso. Overall, I would recommend this product, and had they not claimed the glass was anti-static, I would have given it a 5."

I have had it a little over two months, and use it daily. The grind settings work perfectly and the unit itself is easily cleaned. I got the orange color, which really pops and looks fantastic in my kitchen. I use a French press, and the coarse setting is ideal. I sometimes also make espresso, and the fine setting for this works beautifully as well. I realize some reviews say the problem is that you cannot use it more than 20 seconds at a time, but I use 8 scoops of coffee generally and it takes only 10 seconds to grind. How much more coffee does one need? I think it produces plenty of coffee grounds in 20 seconds..so no worries there as far as I am concerned. Buy this, and you won't regret it!"

Bodum's Bistro Burr Coffee Grinder is quiet (compared to most), found a way to keep static to a minimum, and perfectly grinds coffee beans. The coffee comes out perfectly each time - from a course grind to an espresso powder. It is a small unit that still grinds enough beans for a pot/press of coffee. Simply a great appliance.\n\nSo then why only 4 stars? Because the instructions and controls are lacking. You have to experiment to find the combination between grind size and time. The instructions are not very helpful. Once you grind a batch you have to wait for several minutes before grinding again. This makes finding the perfect grind for your brewer will take some time and mistakes. Bodum could have easily fixed this with some suggestions in their manual.\n\nThat said this is a great machine. For those of us who love coffee this is a must have. Burr grinders are so much better than blade cutters that burn and chop coffee. The resultant grind from Bodum's grinder is perfect with all of the oils and flavor intact."

Another great features is much less spill and mess with its Borosilicate glass catcher. Noise is not bad, definitely a lot less than my earlier Krups grinder. Having two buttons to turn in on and off is also a nice feature.\n\nSo why am holding one star back?

            "reviewText": "I got this grinder back in November 2011. I use it about 5 times a week (maybe more), and I make French Press, Drip and Espresso using this grinder.\n\nBuild quality seems pretty good for what it is. From the pictures online, the thing seemed to look much more heavy, but it's construction is plastic and its fairly light weight. Everything seems to go together well, and it looks spectacular, especially when you load it up with beans - every bit as cool at home as it looks in the pictures online.\n\nThe only minor issues with build are:\n\n1.) It seems very light (but my expectation was that it would be heavy).\n\n2.) I cannot use it on the most coarse setting. I have to set the dial one tick in. The coarsest setting is one tick away from the \"release\" position where you can remove the hopper. There is apparently a safety mechanism that causes the motor to stop when the hopper dial moves to the \"release\" position. The vibration causes the dial to gradually move over to the \"release\" position and cause the unit to stop. I thought this was going to be a serious issue at first, but to be honest, I haven't even thought about it 'til just now.\n\nThe instructions say to let it cool 5 minutes for every 20 second grind, I have to say, I have exceeded this almost every time I've used it. I usually grind two, 20 second batches, back-to-back. While I never recommend disregarding the manufacturer's instructions, I wouldn't be too paranoid about it.\n\nAs far as grind quality, you can't ask for much better. The grind is consistent throughout each run, and consistent from run to run. The coffee is very good from any of the 3 methods I use. The espresso grind is very consistent in texture, and you don't see any bits of chaff or anything other than a nice silky brown powder.\n\nAs for cleaning, I give it a good once-over every week. I bought a couple cheap paint brushes (<$1) and cut the bristles shorter (1 med, 1 short). I use the stiffer one to clean the burr, and longer to get into the crevices inside. I turn it upside down and give it a few pats on the back to dump any excess grind. A little bit of the grind lands on the inside of the machine, but no more so than other grinders. I usually give it a couple pats on the side after a grind too to try to get as much of that into the receptacle. Invariably, as with any grinder, some of the grind will spill out onto the counter. It's not as spotless as some reviews here have you believe, but this thing is still miles ahead of other grinders.\n\nOverall, I gave the grinder 4 stars because of the issue with the coarsest setting causing the unit to stop and the fact that you are supposed to stop and wait 5 minutes after every 20 seconds. A machine like this should be designed to run steady state. ...And, I still think it should be heavier.\n\nHope this review is helpful.\n\n--DanG"

Give the top part of the unit (where the dial is to set the time) a little tap after you're done grinding. This will expel the grinds that are in the nooks and crannies, and is important if you're doing more than one grind.\n\n3. You might get a little spillage when you remove the cup after the grinding cycle is complete. Again, tapping the top part of the unit will help this.\n\nFor the price, this is an excellent grinder, especially for the newbie. It doesn't take up a lot of space on the counter and it's fairly quiet for a burr grinder."

And if you really want to blow your buds off, use any small batch roasted coffee and one of the two drip makers that go to the recommended 200 degree brew (Newco and the utterly overpriced Dutch!), you'll taste coffee like you never had, the combo of good beans + proper conical grinding + 200 degrees = coffee heaven."

I can grind 4 scoops of beans in that 20 seconds, which is enough for my purposes. If you are just making a medium amount of drip coffee, then this thing works great and is cheaper than the alternatives. If you need more versatility or want to make a lot of coffee, then you may want to pay more for a different one."

When I'm making my first cup of coffee at 6 AM, my eyes still full of sleep and my pre-caffeinated movements clumsy and sluggish, I really want something that's simple and reliable. I don't want to have to think about too much when I'm making coffee in the morning.\n\nDoes the Bodum Bistro burr grinder satisfy this need? After a little trial and error, yes it does.\n\nOverall, it's an excellent grinder, and very easy to use. Whole coffee beans go in the cone at the top, with a tight lid that keeps them sealed in and fresh. The cone fits about half a pound of coffee at a time. The timer at the front sets the time of grinding, up to a maximum of 20 seconds. Once the timer is set, you start grinding with a simple push of a button next to the timer. A small, snugly-fit glass container receives the grinds.\n\nAnd it does make a consistently good cup of coffee. The ground coffee smells wonderful and looks good, no large chunks or missed beans that you sometimes get from a chop grinder. I've been using this almost every day for a month, and so far it's been a delight.\n\nMy only quibble with this grinder is that there's nothing to indicate how much you're getting when you grind the coffee. The timer tells you how long it's working for, but not how many cups you can expect to get, and there's no measurement on the glass receptacle either. It took some trial and error with the first few attempts to figure it out. A full 20-second grind gets you about enough ground coffee for 7 to 8 cups in a drip machine. Once I figured this out, it works reliably, but it would have been helpful to have this somehow indicated on the machine itself somehow - seems like an easy fix, and is the only feature I miss from my old grinder.\n\nThese days, though, I'm pretty happy just to have a grinder I can depend on. One I can find with blurry early morning eyes and get running with sleep-clumsy fingers, and one that will still give me a great cup of coffee every time.\n\nThe Bodum Bistro is definitely that grinder."

I've used it at least daily for over a month now and have really come to appreciate it. It is extremely consistent and the timed grind thing makes for very consistent quantities. This is my first burr grinder and it is certainly a step up from the spinning blade type. Anyways, it is a nice reliable tool that does its job well.\n\nSo, why not for spices ... because of the clean-up and tinkering. I really don't want to mess around with this thing's operational bits. I've seen reviews of other bodum grinders that indicate that it might not be up to constant tinkering. Spice grinding does require a lot of manipulation to get things clean, get the grind right, then get things clean again. This grinder could well be up to it, but I'm not willing to experiment because it does such a good job on coffee. I'm not willing to risk breaking it without really good cause.\n\nFinally, does it help produce a better cup? Somewhat. To really go far down the coffee geek path you've got to be able to repeatably produce the same result. Otherwise you're just buying stuff to show off. Consistent water temp, a press, and a timer are better incremental improvements than moving to a burr grinder. So, it isn't critical to replace blades with burrs unless the other stuff is already under control. If the blade grinder is broke or being repurposed then going to a burr (especially this one) is a solid move."

I use small brushes to clean the grinding mechanism and then use a Dyson vacuum to suck the finer coffee powder. I like the size of the Bistro because it can be handled with one hand and turned upside down for cleaning.\n\nI almost gave up grinding my own beans because of the mess with other grinders, so I'm glad I came across the Bistro. This grinder makes my coffee fuller and richer tasting and combined with my Bonavita BV1800 coffee maker, I'm able to make a consistently good cup of coffee."

People will ask what it is and guess that it's a grinder at the same time. The compliments you receive is just wonderful.\nThe different grades of blending is also quite nice.\nI've tried different blends with the Bodum french press to find out exactly which level of grind is my favorite.\nMakes up to 8 cups each time.\nI will try to blend other stuff next time like peanuts and sesame seeds to see how they turn out.\nBut I think at $50-70 range is the right price range. It's a bit pricey for the $100 range, thus the one star reduction.\n\nHighly recommended."

After less than 3 months of average use (1-2 grinds a day) the power button completely broke and pushed into the unit and was unretrievable. I even tried to open the unit to repair but the build doesn't allow that. This product seems well designed aesthetically, but poorly manufactured (in China).\n\nOther issues I found:\n-The grinder occasionally would lock up and needed beans to be cleared out of the grinding teeth to be fixed - which requires removing the bean funnel at the top. But removing that WITH beans in it will cause all the beans to funnel out and spill all over the place.\n\n-The grind canister is fairly loose in its position and gets coffee grounds everywhere - overall this is a messy grinder.\n\nEven if the switch hadn't broken I was disliking this grinder. I am attempting to return this and will get a different brand. I love Bodum's product design overall but the build on this item is a major let down. I will try other products again from them perhaps, but avoid this particular model."

The grind is very consistent.\n\nIt grinds on a timer. I use 12-14 seconds' worth, or 5-6 tablespoons whole beans, for a full press pot.\n\nBecause it grinds on a timer, you can store your coffee in the hopper. The cover seals it airtight.\n\nQuieter than my old blade grinder.\n\nCons:\nOnly one I can think of: As other reviewers have mentioned, you can only grind 20 seconds' worth of beans at a time, so if you make large pots of drip coffee, this may not be the grinder for you. But if you make coffee in smaller amounts, it's a decently priced grinder that yields consistent results for smooth, better-tasting coffee."

So don't buy this for espresso.\n\nUPDATE: After several more attempts this grinder started working perfectly well. It grinds on the finest setting and grinds enough in 15 seconds for a double espresso. On coarser settings it grinds enough for a full pot in 15 seconds. No complaints at all. There is virtually no electrostatic scatter with the glass container."

I drink French Press, and I looked and looked and looked for a grinder that would grind consistently coarse for FP and not leave a lot of sludge in the bottom. Now I'm not a rich man. I'm not a Carl Weathers, par example. So I haven't been able to experiment with this and that grinder, this and that bean, make espressos, and all that. But what I can tell you is that if you are using a blade grinder and want to step it up a little, this is an awesome replacement.\n\nSome have said that it cannot go coarse enough for FP. Now maybe I'm doing it wrong, but I actually think that one step in from the coarsest is the best. The coarsest lacked body and two in from that was over-extracted, so the second-coarsest is what I use. There's a tiny bit of dust in the bottom of the cup at the end, but nothing like what I got from my blade grinder. So if you want a good grinder to get a better consistency to replace a blade grinder, you'll be pleased as punch with this one.\n\nIt's not too loud; in fact, I'd say compared to a lot of blade grinders this thing is, if not quieter, at least a lot less annoying. Think of Barry White screaming in your kitchen instead of Gilbert Godfried.\n\nWorth it!\n\nUPDATE: 2/11/13\nStill use this bad boy about every day and have not had any problems with it. I clean it probably once a month, which takes about 5 minutes. I now use the coarsest setting for FP, which I still drink exclusively. Still works like the day I got it. Recently my son broke the grounds catcher (Grounds Catcher Willy, I call it). It is only cracked, so I haven't yet decided to purchase a replacement. But I looked, and I found them for about $9. So they are cheap to replace.\n\nUPDATE: 3/2/16:\nThis guy is still running strong, and I use it about every day. I use it for Chemex, now, too, and I'm very pleased with it. No troubles."

Had to wait 20 minutes to grind a bit more coffee to make a pot (I like it strong). However, if you plan ahead, this should not be an issue. Once the grinder is done grinding I recommend taping the grinder on the side to loosen up any ground coffee in the shoot. If you pull the glass cup before you tap it, you could end up with a small pile of grounds on your counter. I make 3 to 4 pots a week. So far it has preformed with no problems and gives nice, evenly ground coffee.\n\nIf you are like me and you order your coffee from coffee roasters on the internet and get the coffee the day after it is roasted because you want it as fresh as possible, this grinder is an excellent choice that will not break the bank. You could buy a more expensive grinder, but you will find it hard to find a better one without stepping up to a 'pro' grinder."

Several reviewers touted the glass container for the grounds as generating less static electricity for fewer clinging grounds but I don't find that to be the case. I think the burr grinders make a marked difference in the taste compared with the shredding of our previous blade grinder.\n\nSo far, so good."

Our previous grinder was a cheap one which did not really grind beans, more like mash them, but this grinder is several steps above our previous one. I could not believe how fine the espresso grinds would be; it almost reminds me of sand. The machine itself could not be easier to use, which is a plus. Also, it does not take up much space, which is a plus for us since counter space is at a premium in our kitchen. Overall, a great grinder."

It's perfect for us, but if you are planning to use it with a large drip grinder, which requires more coffee, you might consider something else because it doesn't grind a lot at once. I love that you can click the button and walk away from it rather than needing to stand there and hold the button while the coffee grinds.\n\nUpdate: We've now used this daily for 2.5 years. Grinder is still working perfectly. We've switched up our brewing system since the original review, and been using the grinder on it's finest setting for about six months now. Still no complaints.

So, it only took a few months, and when lifting it up to clean up the mess the container falls out and shatters. Bad design (also stupid me for not taking it out first, I know). They should have foreseen that this was a very likely event and made the container out of something that doesn't send shards of glass all over the counter when dropped from 4 inches. Also, a little on the loud side, so if someone gets up early to make coffee it can wake up others in the home. Overall, it does a good job, but I would not buy it again due to the flaw in the glass catch container."

While many are saying the first 20 seconds works fine, we are not finding that to be true. We DO NOT EVEN get the FULL 20 seconds on the FIRST BUTTON PUSH. The timing is very inconsistent which makes every pot hit or miss each morning. My husband will use his watch to time it so he knows how to adjust the timing for the correct amount; however, I WILL NOT DO THIS EVERY MORNING (life is too short plus I don't own a watch) and if we are to wait five minutes between short spurts, again life is too short. For example, this morning my husband had it SET FOR 20 seconds and ONLY GOT 7 seconds and a second push got him almost 10 seconds and tried again which now gave him the 20 seconds. At least two out of three times it gives you less seconds than what is selected. This results in varying amounts of ground coffee each morning...too weak or too strong and rarely perfect.\n\nMy other issue is as another reviewer stated, the static is NOT better; it is about the same. I even find the static to be MESSIER than our old plastic container. When you go to pull the container out, there is always a clump that falls out onto the grinder platform/plate. You go to wipe it up and as soon as you touch the platform more falls out. Then, when you take the cover off the glass container to tap into your drip brewer basket, it sprays and much of the ground beans stick inside the glass. It is difficult to get this amount out and every bit of ground beans are needed since you cannot get enough to grind in the first place.\n\nWe have been using this grinder for a little more than a month and I am tired of not knowing which mornings I will get a good cup of coffee. It is not worth the cost even at a very discounted price of $60. Unfortunately, we are just past the 30 days to return it and are now stuck with it.\n\nThe only good thing about this grinder is we find we are using less coffee!! Now that I am cheated of a good cup of coffee every morning, maybe I will give up my only vice and switch to green tea!"

            "reviewText": "I used this grinder for about 7 months and then it stopped grinding as much coffee even on the same grind time. I assumed the gears were somehow breaking. Finally it stopped working completely. Unfortunately Bodum didn't honor their warranty. The grinder was fine for the time I had it, but I am very disappointed with the costumer service."

            "reviewDate": "February 26, 2011",
            "reviewText": "I shop carefully and pay attention to consumer reviews. When I bought some Kopi Luwak at $80 for 1/4 lb. I wanted a top-rated established (affordable) burr grinder for the best grind possible. So when I read the generally glowing reviews of the Bistro on this site and ordered it for myself, I wonder, \"Did I get a lemon?\" No matter what setting I use, the finest espresso grind or the coarsest french press grind, all the coffee comes out extremely fine. As in dust - as in cakes together like flour. I have tried a couple of different beans and roasts and I get the same results. At the coarsest setting I get some additional larger chunks mixed in with the espresso-type grind but that's about it. If I try this in my press I will get coffee soup. I am having it replaced as defective with the same model and I hope there is just something wrong with this first one, but we'll see. I will update after I try the replacement. I contacted the Bodum customer service twice by email but have received no response despite a promise that all emails will be answered in 24 hours. Meanwhile, I will keep shopping for another brand in case my second Bodum works no better than the first.\nAlso, I am curious about the 20 second limit for grinding to prevent overheating, because I happened to notice in the manual's non-English sections several other languages that specify a 40 second max. I would take the 20 second rule with a grain of salt and do a 30 - 40 second grind without too much fear, then let it cool. That's just me.\nUPDATE: I received my replacement and tried the coarse and fine grinds and this unit appears to be better. The fine grind is definitely a consistent, fine texture that should work well for espresso, but the coarse grind still looks a bit finer than what I'm used to seeing from my roasting shop when I request coffee for a french press. Nevertheless, I will keep this one and upgrade it to four stars."

            "reviewText": "I purchased this grinder a few months ago so I could have a grinder with specific grind settings. This grinder grinds the beans well with a great motor. However, after the grind is done, about a half scoop to a whole scoop of ground coffee always gets stuck in the chamber. You need to shake the unit to get all of the coffee out. As a result, there is a mess to clean each time. I called Bodum customer service twice. The first answer I got was I was using oily beans,(eight o'clock), she recommended Starbucks. I bought the Starbucks and I am still having the problem. I called Bodum again and was told this was a normal thing for the ground coffee to get stuck. If anybody has any ideas or recommendations for me to help me grind my coffee without the ground coffee mess, I am all ears."

The grinder shuts down after 5-20 seconds so you must repeat this about 5 times to get enough coffee for one pot. The static is horrible so you are left with coffee grounds all over the counter and your hands.\nDo not waste your money. I put mine out with the garbage."
