It also looks pretty good given the size and the price.\n\nIf you like your coffee beans extra fine, you will need to shake it around a bit in between pulses. That's its only real drawback, if you even want to call it that. Cleaning isn't the easiest either, but its not so bad I would call it a pain.\n\nOverall, a great little buy for a great little kitchen for those of us who want to save just a little here and there on coffee."

My two complaints are, with my unit, the grind button hangs up. Once you push hard enough to break it loose, it is very smooth and easy. But each time I remove the lid, then put it back on, it hangs up again :(\nSecondly, if you just put the grounds in and hold the grind button for however long, after 15 or 20 seconds, the grounds around the edge will stop circulating and give you an uneven ground, and even a few beans that are nearly whole ! The only way to rectify this, is to pick it up and shake it a few times... or even, to just hold it and shake it the whole time its grinding. So yea, it works, but not without some help.\nFeels pretty solid though. Compact and clean appearance."
