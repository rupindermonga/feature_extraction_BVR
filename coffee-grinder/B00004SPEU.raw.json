I reached out to KRUPS who asked me to send the product back since it was still within the warranty period. I returned the product 2 weeks ago; today, I received an email from customer service indicating that it will take 2-3 weeks to determine if the product is repairable. If not, I might (not, I will) get a new grind/ brew coffee maker. This is nonsense. Not waiting a month for a crappy coffeemaker. I purchased a Cuisinart. I have had Cuisinart grind/brew before, they break after 2-3 years, but at least it\u2019s not within 2-3 months, like Krups. Don\u2019t buy this product. Bad product, bad service.\n\nLess than 6 months after I purchased this product, the grinder stopped working. I looked for online fixes but Krupp\u2019s uses a triangle shaped screw so I can\u2019t open the unit to attempt to fix using online instructions. The user manual does not address how to fix grinder problems which apparently is something that happens often shortly after the warranty expires. I bought a Krupp\u2019s thinking this was going to be a quality product - apparently I was wrong. I\u2019m going to try calling Krupp\u2019s in hopes they will replace."

Even if you do, it still smells a bit like stale coffee (or spices). But for the price, it does the job extremely well. I've found that for coffee you can get coarse-ground with a 5-second solid push of the on button. Medium ground (my preference) for a 12 second press. And very find powder for a 20 second press. Pro-tip: Gently/slowly Shake the grinder while it's grinding to help make a more consistent grind, otherwise you end up with a mix of fine and coarsely ground particles.\n\nAn absolute must for anyone that enjoys freshly ground \"whole-bean\" coffee made in a French Press! (compare to any chain coffee shop, you will never go back!)"

My opinions are based on the comparison of this grinder v/s the Mr. Coffee Blade Grinder with Chamber Maid Cleaning System (I owned this one for nearly four years)\n\na. Both grinders are fairly powerful and do the basic job well which is grinding the coffe beans.\nb. Mr. Coffee has some additional settings in terms of desired coarseness, cup size of the beans which is missing from the KRUPS grinder. In all honesty, I never used the feature in Mr. Coffee and mostly judged the coarseness by eye.\nc. The most important distinction which made me dislike the product is that this is horrible design if you want to store the coffee beans for later use. As soon as you open up this grinder, closing the lid back with coffee still inside locks the lid in place and makes it really hard to remove it the next time around. I have spilt a lot of coffee grind trying to do this. The only workaround is to consume the coffee at once after grinding or store it another container.\nd. This design also makes it difficult to clean the grinder. With Mr. Coffee the top was separated from the motor and was dishwasher safe.\n\n3/5 for inherently bad design."

This grinder did NOT grind the coffee grounds evenly and left big chunks of the beans (of all places) on the bottom of the grinder, even though I was only grinding for 2 cups of coffee and I did not overfill the grinder in any way. Also, the cord was extremely short and much shorter than my current Krups grinder. I have been using Krups grinders for more than 15 years and was hugely disappointed - I feel ripped off and have arranged to return the grinder. Will not buy this product online again."

            "reviewText": "This would have been a 5 star review had the machine been better at regulating the strength of the coffee and had a larger pot. I may be the reluctant \"Queen\" of grind and brew machines. I have had quite a few in search of everything I want: ease of use, control of strength, little or no maintenance, easy clean, large pot, and a heater plate. I have tried Cuisinart (several makes - about 3 different ones), Kenmore, Breville, Capresso, and Gourmia. In my quest for a decent grind and brew, I found many were quite flawed because they broke or jammed easily, they were hard to clean and required in depth cleaning often, or were cheaply made with inferior plastic parts. So when my most recent machine (a high end Breville) started to to go after just 9 mos of ownership, I was exasperated. I was tired of searching for what didn't seem to exist, and for paying big $ for poorly engineered machines. Yet I did not want to give up the grind and brew type because it makes the best coffee I believe. So I came across this Krups. I decided to chance it as I had not tried Krups yet.\nWhen I received the machine, I quickly realized it is essentially a Capresso. However, it so far is not as persnickety as a Capresso and is much easier to clean and maintain. The coffee is great and the machine is easy to use. It keeps the pot hot for several hours - an important feature for me because the thermal higher end pots do not do this to my satisfaction. Plus they pour lousy. It is kinda loud while grinding, and it is a bit slow in making the coffee, but those are minor flaws I can easily live with. The biggest knock I have against the machine is how much beans it uses and how it does a poor job of regulating the strength of the coffee. On any setting or grind level the coffee comes out the same - strong. I like it that way, so I can deal, but I would prefer to have it work the way it is supposed to so I have control of flavor. I have had it for 1 week at this writing, so we shall see. I am glad I bought it so far. I hope it lasts a long time, and maybe when it dies there will be an improved version. For now it is the best I have found."

I've tried grinding less (and ended up with a course grind that didn't work well), and I've grinded too long (where I ended up with coffee dust), and I'm just wasting my beans and time. I purchased this because America's Test Kitchen recommended it (this is the last time I trust them). I'm going to just replace the inexpensive grinder I had for years, that served me well, and determined my grind by the number of cups I needed and let me select the grind I wanted (course, drip, or espresso). I'd bet this is a good product, it's just not great for someone who doesn't know the best grind by sight.\n\nNote: I added label pics because someone asked about voltage"

The worst thing about this grinder is how great it could be despite this major flaw, of it apparently overheating randomly and smoke exiting from where the power cable goes into the casing! The strong smell of burning electricity and smoke exiting this grinder negates all the pros which are: a very affordable price at less than 20 dollars. small design which fits well in the kitchen, fast grinded java beans for a quick morning espresso, easy to clean steel blade. However the benefit of having fresh ground espresso coffee at an affordable price is negated when the smell of burning electricity/ plastic and smoke start filling your kitchen really starts the day on the wrong foot and presents a safety issue. Maybe this one unit is defective, I have contacted the company and had no response yet, but this is my first time using a KRUPS grinder and if it isn't just the case of one defective unit then I cant recommend them. If it proven to me that it was just one defective unit I will remove this review."

            "reviewDate": "September 7, 2018",
            "reviewText": "I did a lot of research on grind & brew machines (Capresso, Cuisinart, DeLonghi, Krups, Kenmore) that weren't a few hundred dollars (Breville) before buying the Krups. Background: I had a Cuisinart grind & brew (DGB550) for 6 years before the filter basket started popping off whenever I used whole beans (vibrations from grinder), which spilled coffee & grinds all over the countertop and in the machine. I had taken for granted the need to wash (not just a quick rinse) the grinder+lid, filter basket+lid, and carafe every single time we used the machine. I was thus determined to find a grind & brew that made decent fresh coffee, wasn't a pain to clean, and didn't cost an arm and a leg.\n\nI've had the Krups for 2 months now and overall it's great. I had to return the first one because every so often, it wouldn't start ... after speaking to Krups customer service, the only way was to go through a non-grind brew cycle, then the machine would essentially reset so that I could run a grind-brew cycle. Pretty sure it was a specific unit defect, haven't had the issue since I got it replaced with a new one.\n\nThe main complaints I saw on Krups reviews was that 1) some of the grinds were wasted during brewing because they would not be wet, 2) too many beans being used, 3) inconsistent brew strength, 4) loud when grinding, 5) small bean holder. Feedback: 1) whenever I brew, all the grinds are wet and level in the filter, so I haven't seen any issue. 2) I haven't found grinds hiding anywhere, so I'm not sure it's using significantly more beans than is needed to brew the coffee. 3) As long as the coffee isn't weak-tasting or super concentrated, I'm good with it. The coffee has tasted fine on all strength settings. 4) Yes, it's loud, but not any louder than my Cuisinart. Any mechanical grinding action is going to be loud unless it's encapsulated deeper into the machine or has additional barriers to reduce the sound transmission (I would assume more expensive machines may do that better, but not necessarily a primary consideration when designing a coffee maker. 5) We brew 5-6 cups (2 full big mugs) almost every day and have to refill the bean holder every few days ... for me, not too inconvenient.\n\nOther observations: the carafe is a bit flimsy, especially the lid that flips open when you pour the coffee ... always have to remember to keep my thumb on the top; cleaning is easy as only the filter basket needs to be emptied and rinsed along with the carafe; the gold tone filter is common amongst most coffee machines and I've never found it to be effective (vs. paper filter). Overall I'm very happy with the Krups grind & brew."

In under 15 seconds of pulsing the grinder, I had a very good medium fine grind of the now khao khua. Rice is pretty hard anyway and when it is toasted much of the water content evaporates leaving a very hard kernel. Traditionally, a pestle and mortar are used. With a little care and patience, the Krups grinder will not over heat the spices you grind if you take your time between pulses to keep the temperature down. I'll grind other whole spices as I need them and they will be much fresher than the pre-ground spices we buy. I was able to clean up the bladed part of the grinder using a dry paper towel and tapping the powder out, while rinsing the lid. All in all it worked fine."

And: the amount of ground coffee to water ratio is ridiculously small for the average coffee drinker. \"7 grams of ground coffee per 5 oz. cup\" is only 5/8 of AN ACTUAL 8-ounce cup.(and who in the United States bothers to use grams when our entire history is based on English Measures?)\n(3) The one accurate thing in the packaged instructions: DISCONNECT the machine when not actually grinding! (it's easy to depress the activation button while handling the machine).\n(4) Not \"easy to clean.\" I use a brush about the size of a tooth brush then wipe clean with a damp sponge.\n\nAnyone wanting more or better will have to pay more to get the coffee/spice grinder which meets their needs."

Also, it clogs the filter because the fine granules clog my filter up and yet their are still whole beans so it make for bitter coffee.

I am still using this grinder as I wanted to try and get use of this one to get some use out of it but definitely not happy with it."

While this grinder grinds extremely well, it is not super user friendly.\n\nThe usability issues with the grinder are in the design. To start with the top is angled which allows coffee grinds to spill out; if you turn the grinder over in an attempt to get the ground coffee into the lid you inevitably will still get coffee grounds on the counter. The second issue is the lack of measuring lines for whole bean coffee; perhaps, I was spoiled by the lines on the Kitchen Aid grinder but not having them makes the process of grinding enough coffee for a 12 cup pot of coffee harder. This actually leads to my third issue with the grinder, I can't fit enough beans for 12 cups of coffee like I could with my Kitchen Aid grinder; I have to grind the beans in two portions which increases the amount of coffee grounds that fall onto the counter.\n\nWhile the product grinds coffee amazingly, its user friendliness leaves a lot to be desired."

I actually can get most of the coffee grounds out just by brushing around with the edge of a plastic measuring spoon, since the grounds want to stick by static electricity after you run the grinder. But I have used the bread grinding trick before and after the coriander seeds, and it worked great. You may want to use a rubber gripper to pull the lid off, and unplug it before you do that, since the button to grind is on the lid. The rubber gripper will give you a lot more control easing that lid off slowly so you don't throw grounds all over the counter.

I should have been able to search on this model, KM785D50, and get a list of accessories, but it is nowhere to be found. Krups should focus more on the customer experience. After much searching, I located the part on smallappliance.com but decided to purchase a different brand instead. So far, much happier with my choice. I hope this helps someone.\n\nIf you like a rich cup of freshly ground coffee, this is not for you. While the coffeemaker brews a good pot using already ground coffee, the grind function doesn't grind beans fine enough to make adequately strong coffee.\n\nIn order to brew coffee that is moderately strong, I have to first set the grinder to the most fine setting and ensure the coffee strength is set to Strong. Then I grind 10 cups, the max, and only pour in 7 cups of water. After the coffee is ground, I stop brewing, swing out the filter in order to even out the coffee since the machine grinds it into a ramp and some of the grounds are dry after brewing. I then close the filter door, set to Grind Off, and brew. Using a dark coffee, this will produce a rich cup. But, it is an incredibly manual process.\n\nI will likely return this if possible to do so without the box.\n\nBottom Line: If you are okay with weak coffee, then this machine will suffice. I prefer a rich cup and will look to replace this with another coffeemaker that does a better job of grinding."

When I finally got the lid out, the coffee flew all over the counter, and because I had the silverware drawer partially open in front of me, I had coffee grounds in the drawer as well. What a mess - and I was even being extra careful!\n3. Because of its oils, the finely ground coffee is very difficult to remove from around and under the blade. I turned it upside down and tapped it, but to no avail.\n\nIf you only want one serving of coarsely ground coffee, this would probably work.

I actually have two of these grinders: one for spices, and another one for coffee beans. I\u2019ve used them every day or multiple times a day for years, and they just keep on ticking.\n\nJust put your whole spices in with the blades, put the lid on, and press down on the button until the spices are ground to your liking. I typically pulse the motor instead of running it constantly \u2014 a long run tends to make it heat up a bit. After dumping the ground spices out, a couple swipes with my finger around the grinding bowl will dislodge most of the stray spices. After I\u2019m done, I hand-wash the lid and wipe down the bowl with a damp paper towel, then let it dry or hurry it up myself with a dry paper towel, and it\u2019s ready to go again. I store it with the lid off so the bowl and lid stay very dry, which minimizes spice clumping.\n\nI\u2019ve had my grinders for years and used them frequently and they\u2019re still going strong. I\u2019d buy another one in an instant if something happened to mine. In fact, I\u2019ve bought several more and given them away to family members who've expressed an interest in grinding their own spices.\n\nA word of caution about cleaning: Do not put water into the bowl where the blades are. This should be elementary, but a couple years ago I got annoyed with swiping the bowl with a damp paper towel to clean it because no matter how hard I tried there was always a bit of spice left behind around the blade shaft, under the blades, or along the seam between the metal bowl and plastic side. So I started sloshing a liiiittle water in there, maybe a couple tablespoons, and was gratified to see the bowl nice and clean\u2026 but a couple days later the motor started to sputter. It sounded terrible and I was afraid my beloved spice grinder was going to die. I was so worried, in fact, that I bought another one from Amazon so I wouldn't be without my grinder for even a single day. Then I made the connection with the water. I stopped sloshing water in there, and after a couple days to dry out the spice grinder was working perfectly again and has worked fine ever since (that was two years ago). And the extra grinder? I gave it to another family member who wanted to grind her own spices.\n\nI\u2019ve also tried cleaning it by whizzing a couple teaspoons of dry rice in there, which worked okay but was kind of a hassle, so I just use the damp paper towel and am no longer concerned if a little spice is left behind. I use the grinder for cumin, coriander, and sometimes other savory spices like allspice, fennel seed, white peppercorns etc., which all taste good together, so I am no longer bothered by having a little bit of spice residue in my grinder. If I grind something unusual, which might affect the taste of the next dish I made, I clean the grinder out much more carefully, but still with a damp paper towel: I fold it a couple times and run the corner along the seam, then run a strip of paper towel under the blades, and so forth."

The grinder just died. Arrrgh! Less than 2 years of use. Call us suckers, we just ordered another! It makes the BEST pot of coffee!\n\nUpdated 11/14/2017\nI really wanted to love this Krups grind and brew. I have owned 6 (yes, six) of the older Krups Grind and Brew 7000 series. The coffee always tasted great in the 7000. But the more recent purchases of the 7000 did not work properly; they would grind but not drip the water through. So I looked to this newer version to have solved that problem.\nSo here comes the Krups KM785D50 today. For the first pot, one is supposed to brew 10 cups of clear water using the \u201cGrind Off\u201d function. The purpose of the \u201cGrind Off\u201d function is to be able to brew a pot of coffee with already-ground coffee. (Never put already-ground coffee through this burr grinder.). Turned it on...? Same problem as the 7000... no water processed. Did not even turn on the unit!!! ARRRRGGHH!\nI was able to brew a pot of coffee by using the \u201cgrind and brew\u201d function and it behaved well.\nAfter calling customer service at Krups, we discovered an omission of a very important step in the instruction booklet.\n\nSo here is how it should read, and note I am paraphrasing, new instruction in all caps...\n\nTo brew with already ground beans, put in the desired amount of water. Put into the filter basket the desired amount of ground coffee. Be sure carafe is in place. Make sure your LED screen is activated, showing a blue color by pressing any button. Press \u201cGrind Off\u201d button once, a light will come on that switch. NOW PRESS THE \u201cGRIND/BREW\u201d SWITCH ONCE. A LIGHT WILL COME ON AT THAT SWITCH. AFTER A CONSIDERABLE PAUSE, WATER WILL BEGIN TO FLOW INTO THE FILTER BASKET.\nSuccess finally!\n\nThis Krups coffee maker produces terrific tasting coffee with freshly ground beans.\n\nI also tried the Capresso CoffeeTEAM #464. It is nearly identical as the Krups - same functions, pot, filter, etc. although has a more flimsy feel to it. The difference is, the Capresso coffee doesn\u2019t taste as good. Maybe because the water does not flow over all the grounds. Every pot, some are left dry.\n\nSo I am back to my Krups KM785D50 and its delicious tasting coffee. It played hard to get, but we fell in love after all that!"

It comes in black, which fits in with any decor. It is easy to wash, but it must be done by hand, and the motorized bottom of the grinder must not be immersed in water. Do NOT put it in the dishwasher.\n\nI've attached pictures of some of the things I have ground up. The first picture is whole cloves and fennel. The second picture is raw flax seeds. The third picture is toasted bread crumbs.\n\nI cannot praise this little appliance highly enough, and I have no hesitation recommending it to family and friends.

In the months since I've owned this product, I have had to have it replaced two times, because two different grinders simply stopped working. With the warranty, Amazon has instantly replaced the machine both times. I continue to love this grinder, but it does NOT last, and it is NOT worth buying without that warranty."

I left the grinder alone for about an hour and when I picked it up again, it felt very warm at the bottom. I immediately unplugged it and haven't tried to use it since.\nI concluded that the motor was either defective, or worse, the appliance has an electrical short which is preventing it from operating at full power. A short is especially dangerous because it can result in a significant FIRE HAZARD (hence being warm without being operated).\nFor the record, this grinder was well cared for, suffered no drops, impact damage, or liquid exposure.\n\nOverall a very disappointing purchase.

I have had units at many price points, the Krups KM785D50 is a good balance of features and price. I am glad I bought it."

I was afraid it might be huge looking on my counter, based on the measurements, so I was pleasantly surprised by the compact size. I think the squarish shape attributes to that. This coffee maker is fairly new, so it isn't listed on the Krups website yet, and there's very little info available about it. Thanks to another reviewer on here, though, I had no trouble running my machine.\n\nThe initial cleaning process, as well as any cycle using already ground coffee, requires you to press not one, but TWO buttons. The GRIND OFF button, followed by the GRIND/BREW button. If you don't do this the machine won't run, and could appear not to work, because the instructions don't really go into the second step. To turn off the machine after brewing either method you must press the GRIND/BREW button again.\n\nAs far as quality, I was actually very impressed! Having upgraded from a very plasticy Mr. Coffee programmable machine, I thought this Krups (though also plastic) was much heavier duty, and more smartly designed. Time will tell as to how long it lasts, but so far it's gone above my expectations. I will be sure to update this review if there is any change."

Grinding spices for spice mixes at the time you're making them ensures you're getting the best \"bang for buck\", and this grinder works great for that. Runs cool, even when you're reducing peppercorns to powder, and it's easy to get spices both in & out (and to see how things are going in the process.)\n\nAbout the only thing I wish it could do was handle immersion in water - it can be a challenge to clean, especially because you want to clean it thoroughly between spices to avoid cross-contamination of oils & flavors. The container itself is great, but the base and motor can't be immersed so you really need to use a good, food-safe cleaner and a toothbrush to clean the blade and basin. But, given the performance and ease of everything else it does, I'm content with that."

            "reviewText": "This review is for the Krups electric blade (not burr) grinder.\n\nI bought this grinder to use for medium-coarse grinds for a French press. It is LOUD. And I find that it grinds pretty unevenly, as you can see from my included photos - a few pulses lead to a combination of big chunks and fine powder. I tried shaking the grinder and flipping it upside down during use to better distribute the beans, but got the same result. When I made a cup of French press with it, I found that some of the smaller sediment was able to pass through the filter into my cup.\n\nThis grinder is also a bit difficult to keep clean:\n-Lid: The bean dust coats the inside of the lid, which I wash out after use.\n-Blade housing: The blade housing collects a lot of dust, so I\u2019ll need to get a brush to sweep it out after each use - would have been nice if one was included.\n-Outside and rim: The bean dust also clings to the outside of the grinder, and along the edges, making it difficult to close the lid again when the rim is covered in dust.\n\nSo overall, this is ok if you\u2019re grinding for a drip coffee machine or just making the occasional cup like I do, but it's not so great if you\u2019re a coffee connoisseur looking for an even, coarser grind or someone constantly changing beans who would want to clean it in between every use."

This is because you are not supposed to run it for more than a few seconds. As with any coffee grinder if you just run it for a long time the coffee just spins up around the edges. This is why it doesn't have an on switch it just has a button you must hold. If you press the button for 2 seconds then let go so it can stop all the coffee then falls to the bottom where the blades are, and repeat 8 times (at least when grinding four standard coffee scoops) it will be more finely ground than any pre-ground coffee I have ever bought. The whole process should take like 25 or 30 seconds. Not the several minutes that people whom complain say that grind for it just takes a little common sense."

What really frustrates me\u2014and is something I simply can't live with\u2014is the mess that comes from using this appliance. As you can see in the product photo, the actual grinding vessel is very shallow in relation to the clear styrene reservoir, so the vast majority of the resulting grounds are contained in the reservoir. In the course of just a few quick bursts, the styrene protective cover builds up a huge static electric charge, which draws a substantial portion of the coffee grounds out of the reservoir when the grinder is opened, leaving a huge mess all over the outside of the appliance and the surrounding countertop (even worse when you have to do three or four separate grindings to make enough grounds for cold brew). I tried to minimize the mess by inverting the entire appliance when I opened it, but that wasn't any better... the combination of the static cling and the near-vacuum the reservoir creates causes grinds to explode all over the place. As far as I can tell, there's absolutely no way around losing a significant amount of grounds all over the counter. I strongly recommend finding an appliance with a better design for the grinding reservoir."

I finally got it to a reasonable taste by selecting 6 cups to grind and adding filling to four and a half line.\n-The lid on the water compartment has to be manipulated to stay shut, but doesn't affect the operations\n-The permanent grounds basket (including in this new version) has a flat bottom rather than the v shape of the older maker. I don't know if that is a factor in the taste challenges, but it is easier to clean.\nOnce I figured out how to make a cup of coffee that tasted good, it seems to be working fine.

            "reviewText": "This spice grinder is pretty much the same exact design I had twenty-five years ago... I guess if it isn't broken, don't fix it. It chews boldly through coffee beans, rice, dried chilies... pretty much everything I've thrown at (into) it.\nThe one weakness is that the grind control is completely subjective by design; the user interface is pulse-only. If you care about consistency, pour through a wire screen to sift every few pulses and keep regrinding the chunky bits until they pass. Otherwise you get superfine powder with chunks in it.\nThe other thing to watch is that the stuff you're grinding into a fine powder works its way under the blade. It's not a problem functionally, but if you don't want your espresso to taste like paprika, make sure to clean it very carefully when you change over. Or maybe you like the serendipity... I don't judge."

I've seen this or a similar thing while watching the Great British Baking Show and I was mildly amused, that's an understatement.\nOils are easy to clean: just wipe the metal area inside with a paper towel and it's clean. For thorough cleaning I hand wash the cap or put it in the dishwasher if I need to use the machine, and I carefully wash the top by pouring water and hand wash it using sponge and diswashing liquid. It's easy not to hit water in the sensitive bottom part. Very good grinder."

            "reviewDate": "July 23, 2015",
            "reviewText": "We took up the trouble of grinding beans again when we replaced our broken coffee maker. The new maker is not bad at all but the coffee tasted different because of the different size and shape of filter, a bit bitter and doesn't change when adjusting the amount of coffee powder. We still had the old grinder from across the pond but we threw away the transformer, thinking that we will never need it again.\n\nThe other grinders at this price level that have adjustable grind buttons are probably gimmicks. With these mechanisms I don't believe you can do an medium grind uniformly. And the different is in seconds. Your eye and hand coordination, try and error, probably works just as well as the adjustable buttons.\n\nThe oval shape work just the same as rounded, completing a fine grind in no time (<10 sec?), with most of the fine powder stays on the grinder even when you pour. If you do other things or grind very small amount, that may be different. The minimum I grinded is two to three table spoon of coffee bean that doesn't give me any surprises.\n\nThe oval slanted shape makes it easier to pour, and scrape remaining powder into the coffee maker.\n\nThe size is a lot bigger than my old one. This one isn't too big for a single person. The bigger size generates less mess when you open it. And I'm sure it will be big enough for a 12 cup coffee maker when you need that. The cover is all clear plastic (acrylic?) so you can wash it after every use if you choose to.\n\nThis one comes with no brush. Do you need one? Sure you can make use of it but you have to deal with cleaning it then. I just use a spoon to scrape lightly most of the powder out so the amount of powder doesn't vary a lot for each use. And hopefully, the powder that remains don't accumulate in the corners so they are gradually replaced with fresher powder. Roasted coffee beans have natural oil so it's not easy for them to grow germs. In parts of the world as a custom they don't put an oily roast chicken into the fridge. Of course you can clean the grinder thoroughly once every week or month. I discovered my old grinder still have powder on it since last use a few years ago. It is just like yesterday with no smell or rot."

            "reviewText": "I have some other KRUPS coffee grinders that are older than the hills but still work fine. Unlike the old ones, this new grinder has a little black plastic piece sticking out of the lid which is necessary to trigger the motor. It looks like something that could easily break off. The old grinders had a smooth lid with no pieces that could possibly break off. Also, the cord does not stow away in the body of the appliance like in my old Hamilton Beach grinder (the one that just broke because it had a little plastic piece sticking out that broke off). So storage is awkward.\n\nOn the plus side, it has a large capacity and a powerful motor. The oval-shaped body helps the coffee beans to be ground evenly and quickly. I use this machine for coffee only. However, with my old KRUPS grinder, I frequently grind all kinds of spices and nuts for recipes. It works great for this purpose."

We use it as a spice grinder - more often than not taking granulated sugar substitute and making it confectioner's sugar substitute, but also occasionally for other spices like turning granulated garlic into powdered garlic.\n\nHowever, the problem with this grinder comes when you want to go from one kind of spice to another: it is a major ordeal to get it cleaned out! No one wants garlic-flavored icing! The inner pieces are not safe to be cleaned with water, so you are stuck with trying to brush the powder out, or using compressed air to blow it out (far more effective, but also more expensive on an ongoing basis). Seems like Krups should be able to make the inside washable, which would make this a much more valuable kitchen tool."

The customer service rep tersely told me just too look at their website (which obviously I had already checked) and hung up on me. The warranty requires that I drive 6 hours to the nearest service shop, a shop not even owned by KRUPS to not even be gauranteed for them to fix it! All for a $20 product!

A permanent filter will not hold the dust and fine particles created by this grinder.\n\nThe blades are sharp and very low in the grinder, allowing this unit to pick up and pulverize any stray beans. It does the job in well under a minute. I have found that shaking the grinder for a few seconds followed by grinding for another 5-10 seconds takes care of any stray beans.\n\nThe drawback to this unit is the fact that it only has one setting - fine. You can pulse the grinder, but you'll have to experiment to become proficient if you want coarse grounds. The grinder doesn't come with a brush either. This is the first grinder I've owned but my wife said ones she has owned have come with a brush. I just use a plastic spoon to help scrape out the grounds. Works fine for me.\n\nIf you need additional options, spend the money on an expensive unit. For the price, this one is a great buy.\n\nOverall, this unit seems near unbreakable and it should last for years to come.\n\nUpdate: Bought a second grinder, not because the first one stopped working, but because my wife and I both travel for work.

I have ground granular erythritol sweetener to make a fine powder. It works great with grinding granular sugar too. Cleaning it is not difficult. Gentle scraping and using a damp paper towel works for me but be careful as the blades are sharp. I would recommend this grinder to my friends and family."

This fits nicely on my counter next to my coffee machine without taking up much space and it is a strong, efficient grinder despite its small size. It is easy to clean and I use a clean small paintbrush to dust out grounds residue. I took away one start only because since it is so small, I have to grind coffee in batches to make cold brew. But otherwise, I love it! A good buy."

            "reviewText": "Grinding is amazingly easy. Getting the coffee grounds to your coffee maker is... well... A grind.\nDumping the beans into the main compartment and pushing down on the exterior button is simple and efficient. No power controls or anything, but I don't mind.\nThe bigger issue is how to transfer the grounds from grinder to coffee maker. The compartment that grinds the coffee is insight into the main unit, which is plugged in. I find it very difficult scooping out the grinds from the bladed, attached grinder to the filter I'm using. You're limited to a small area and grinds often get stuck under the blades.\nA little trick I use is, after grinding, I tip the whole thing upside down so the grounds fall into the clear plastic cover, then use that as a little dispensing bowl for my filter. This is all well and good, if I've ground the exact right amount. If I didn't, I have extra grounds either sitting in the grinder or the plastic lid. Not easy to store, say to in a fridge , to keep the h grounds fresh.\nContrast this to my old Mr Coffee grinder, which had a detachable head that kept the grounds contained and covered, from which I could spoon out into the filter wherever I liked, then store my extras. It worked nicely and it's a shame Krups doesnt have the same. Oh well. Oh also, heads up: n no measurement lines anywhere on the device. At least it does grind like a champ :)"

I really wanted to try for a nice ceramic burr grinder this time around and that was turning into a major research project. I don't want to pay a fortune for plastic gears and direct contact with burrs that may be full of heavy metals - never mind the non-descript metal burrs, does anyone test what the ceramics are made with? Well, these little blade styles keep those issues a little simpler. Stainless steel blade and cup, minimal contact to the cover. So while the search continues for an electric burr grinder, meanwhile, I just want some decent coffee. Now! For every day drip style, this inexpensive little grinder is fine for our purposes. Alternating pulses with a few gentle shakes during pauses, rather than steady on, keeps both the beans and machine from heating up. Even with that approach, other similar styles used before didn't seem to grind as evenly as this one. The smooth contours of the cup and cap make a bit of clean up after each use very quick and easy. We'll see how long it lasts while, at this price, I could buy and wear out a wholesale lot before I paid for one of the electric burr styles!"

            "reviewText": "I bought this coffee grinder because my Hiro manual hand crank grinder blades are getting dull and doesn't grind well anymore. I wanted something that will last a lifetime and this will probably last decades because the blades will not get dull.\n\nWhen you press down on the black button, it will blend the coffee up. The longer you blend it, the more fine the coffee particles become. So if you want to make espressos, you'll hold the button longer. I thought the blades would be razor sharp but it's not, they're flat edge. You don't have to sharpen it in the far future. You also will not cut yourself if you touch it.\n\nSafety feature: The only way the coffee grinder turns on is if the black button is pressed down. If you remove the clear plastic cap with the black button, you can't accidentally turn it on. Not unless you have something narrow and flat like a flat-head screwdriver that will act like the black button.\n\nI have a Watt Meter and initially when you power it up it will spike up to around 160 Watts and then when it's almost finish it will stay at around 115 to 120 Watts. The more coffee you add into it, the more power it will need to grind it up.\n\nWhen the unit(with the AC power cord) is placed on a digital scale, it will say 1 LB and 6.4 Ounces.\n\nI hope you find this review useful."

Just chopped it up a bit if you can imagine. I also tried placing these whole cloves in a plastic bag and smashing them with a hammer. Another joke! This made many small holes in my plastic bag and the cloves seemed to be indestructible! So I decided to see about using some electric gadget of some sort. Somewhere I came across the idea to use a coffee grinder. So I came here to good ole' Amazon and found me one. Good reviews and looks like this one will last me for many years to come.\n\nI just got this grinder today. I used it on the cloves. (the ones I had kind of chopped up?) It ground the cloves to powder, which is what I wanted. The oils from the cloves did cause the plastic top to become cloudy but I was able to wash that part. The other part you cannot put in water it seems. BUT...as I read some of the posts on here concerning this grinder...one WONDERFUL person posted about how she used uncooked white rice and ground it up to clean the grinder. BINGO! She also stated that she did this twice after grinding cloves. So my problems are solved!\n\nI am so glad I will be able to clean this grinder because I was hoping to also grind flax seeds as well and who knows where this will all lead to?\n\nBottom line: GLAD I bought this grinder. SHARP blades and works QUICK! ABLE to clean...."

This was a mistake for me and I had to re-do my grind and limit it to 4s or less for the coarsness I needed. The quality is good. Came in Amazon frustration free packaging. I can't comment on this for coffee. For this, I prefer a burr based grinder."

The Grinder got jammed (even though I wash it after every use) after I used it a few times and stored it. They sent a replacement unit and the same thing happened to the replacement unit. I would say if you going to use it for coffee grinding then get a burr grinder rather than these chomping blades. As long as it doesn't jam this is a great product."

            "reviewText": "Pros: Cheap, powerful motor and blades\nCons: Uneven grind, smallish capacity\n\nIf you're looking for a coffee grinder, I wouldn't recommend a bladed one, especially if you care about using the right size grind for the right drink. Blade grinders are cheap, but a burr grinder ensures a uniform grind, which is important to get a consistent flavor and brew. This grinder, however, would be perfect for spices, and I would actually recommend using it only for that. Cleaning is relatively easy: just use a damp paper towel to wipe up the remains and a dry one to finish the job."

            "reviewText": "As usual, before purchasing a product, I read many of the numerous reviews. I found nothing that seemed a significant concern. Received it this Dec. 2018 with Amazon's characteristic timeliness and sturdy packaging. BUT after making coffee for the first time this week on several days, discovered what seems a unavoidable and time-consuming clean up mess from coffee grounds inside that then scatter everywhere (counter, etc.) during clean up. SO I went back to descriptions to re-read. Eventually found many that referenced \"messy\" when using that in word in my search. However, these comments were not easily found otherwise. I noticed that mixed with questions and reviews on all topics were numerous comments focused ONLY on the coffee bean grinder, as if it were the only component! Why would anyone pay this for a coffee maker and ONLY ask or discuss what kinds of spices you can grind? A few did refer to spices that impact the coffee flavor, but many did not. I began wondering if the site might be including other KRUPS products such as their separate grinders under one big category! Whether this is true or not, the significant focus on the grinder for so many comments seems to result in more than typical difficulty in discovering negative comments about the coffee itself, especially the unavoidable \"messy\" characteristic, unrelated to the grinder! (Grinding beans or using coffee already ground produced similar results!) Two stars for very good coffee could easily have been four or five stars if the product was constructed to provide even the clean up ease of a very basic \"Mr. Coffee\" maker! I am an avid Amazon consumer. It is uncharacteristic for me to ever write a negative review. However, I would not purchase THIS product again unless the \"messy\" characteristic was effectively resolved!"

I am ordering another Mr coffee grinder due to the capacity being larger, you remove the entire cup after grinding, give it a twist to loosen any \"caked\" grounds, and pour it into your filter. It's larger, cleaner and empties all of the grounds out. Plus it has settings for how many cups you want to grind (it shuts off after a set amout of time) and has 3 grind settings."

While it doesn't hold a ton of beans, it grinds them in a matter of seconds. We never grind more than 1 or 2 loads of beans anyway because you don't want the coffee to loose its freshness by being ground for too long before use.\n\nIf you're just looking into grinding your own coffee, this grinder makes it so easy.

I needed a replacement and did a lot of research before settling on the Krups.\n\nI can't tell anyone how it grinds coffee... but spices are ground perfectly. Keep in mind that you must put enough in the cup for best results. If a recipe calls for a pinch of something... well, you might have to grind more than you need, or just use a mortar and pestle for the small quantities.\n\nThe grinder stops grinding almost immediately upon release of the button which is great when you have achieved the grind you want. It is relatively quiet for a grinder of this type... but as with *any* coffee/spice grinder... it is not quiet enough to fire up while the family is sleeping in the morning. Ha.\n\nAs for the reviews in which the lid/cup is hard to remove... Yes, it is... for the first few times of using it. It has been painstakingly paired with the base and fits very snugly. Once you start getting some particles of coffee or spices in the cup it will become much easier to remove because the \"dust\" from the coffee etc acts as a type of lubricant... so don't give up on such a great product. I would rather have lids that fit more securely than fall off anyway.\n\nAll in all I am very pleased with this grinder and highly recommend it for grinding spices of all kinds."

The grinder, on the other hand, purred like a well-honed machine--it would have made great ground coffee that could never have been brewed.\n\nI do not know if my experience is anomalous, but I do know that I resent having to spend tomorrow afternoon going to UPS to return this product.

One is cleaning, the grinding area can not be washed, has to be wiped down after use. I have to use a plastic knife to scrape the grounds off the bottom and sides, you may try to use a stiff brush. The second thing is that you need to time yourself to grind the coffee for coase or fine. The coffee grounds are not totally even either. I used a Mr.Coffee grinder before until the plastic parts inside broke and pieces were mixed into my coffee, that was the main reason I ended up bought this Krup grinder. Now I kind of miss my old grinder which can be taken apart for washing ( the plastic part prevents the grounds sticking to the bottom and wall.) and it has fine, medium and coase setting which it shuts down automatically even you are still holding the button. I hope Mr.Coffee would use thin stainless steel scraper to replace the plastic scraper inside."

It has a clear top that you can see what is going on in the grinder. Another thing that I like, what ever you are grinding does not leave the bowl. The last Krups grinder that I had, the coffee beans or spices fed down into and out another hole to the collection vessel. After a while it gets caked up and burns up. Not this one. Once you finish grinding, you dump out the product. I like this much better. Kudos!"

But that doesnt seem to have been a problem for it. Definitely some crevices that are a little more difficult to clean, but all in all really not that bad. I agree it probably doesnt give you the best perfectly ground beans. I like to give it a little shake as i grind it. But with a little shake it does the job. Its pretty cheap and im drinking some random coffee beans so maybe not for the super refined palate but absolutely great for a starter grinder. Been using for about two months now.

I have used it on fresh herbs and it does grind/blend just fine as long as its in liquid and has enough volume for the blades to reach it (essentially you're blending it). I have used it to put together various salad dressings and it works just as well for that as for grinding coffee. As far as grinding coffee, I'm not sure why some reviews said that it doesn't make coarse grounds, I've been able to make coarse grounds just fine, but you have to make it in small batches, just enough beans to cover the silver part inside, then just blast it four short times and the grounds are perfectly coarse. If you fill it and grind it for a while you'll get very fine grounds. Something I do want to note is the design. As others have mentioned, the slanted design does cause grounds to fall out if you try utilizing the whole lid worth of beans. Either you can limit how far you fill it (to the shorter end) or you can fill it up and after grinding unplug it, tip it upside down and remove the lid with the freshly ground coffee/herbs inside the lid. All in all, awesome product, especially for the price."

I'm a pretty heavy coffee drinker, and I work from a home office full-time, so my coffee grinder is among the most important appliances I own.\n\nSo far, I'm happy with the F203 Krups. The motor is spec'd at slightly higher power than the Braun, not that this was ever a problem before.\n\nThe F203 has an oval cross-section (viewed from above) which makes the coffee a little easier to pour than the round shape of my old Braun. I wish the coffee well (below where the lid separates) was just slightly deeper, but I'm getting used to it.\n\nMy only complaint so far is that the bearings have slightly more vibration than my old unit. It feels sturdy enough, and given the light duty cycle that a home coffee grinder enjoys I suspect it will last many years."

You wash the lid in soap, even dishwasher, and just wipe out the mechanism with cloth. The design is also simple and sleek, not take up much room. So based on my experience with the old one, totally recommend it. But I do know that many appliances are not built to last as much as even 15 years ago."

The only issue I have is that the grinding chamber if not really easy to clean. If you're grinding things that are oily or very aromatic, it can be a challenge to get it ready for the next thing you're grinding. Part of the reason is that the grinding chamber and blades are permanently fixed and cannot be removed and the grinder is not dishwasher safe or submersible. The trick to cleaning it is to use a damp paper towel to get all of the grind residue, then a slightly soapy paper towel to de-oil the chamber, especially under the cutting blades and finally rinse it with another dampened paper towel. The whole thing takes about 3-4 minutes to clean, but is a little awkward. Other than the cleaning, I love this grinder and would probably buy it again unless the make one with a removable chamber."

I did find that not overfilling the container, and stopping partway through to shake it a tiny bit before continuing were good tactics for getting the grind I want.\n\nFor noise levels, I think it's fairly quiet for what it is. You will have noise, of course - it's grinding hard beans! I don't appear to have woken anyone up or irritated anyone watching tv in our open-plan home, however, so for what it does, it's quiet IMO.\n\nThe thing most people complained about was difficulty getting it clean. This is also my one complaint, but it isn't a huge one. I tip the grinder over my garbage and give it a few good thwacks, then take a paper towel and wipe everything out well. You do have to try to get into the area under the blade, but with the paper towel protecting my fingers this isn't a big deal. If you have a small brush that may help; I do not.\n\nAll in all I'm pleased with my purchase. It's excellent value for the money and I am thrilled I can grind fresh coffee whenever I want, now."

This little grinder can reduce coffee beans to grinds in just a few short seconds. The way it's been designed, it sucks all the heavy whole beans down into its blades and forces the lighter ground beans to the top. This flow makes for a near-instant grind. It's impressive.\n\nIt's also very compact and looks nice enough to leave on my counter top between uses. The inside of the grinding compartment is very slick, making cleanings quick and easy. The top lid is a thick transparent plastic. Up-ending the unit after grinding puts all the grounds into the lid for easy transport to the coffee machine, or to a container for storage.\n\nOverall, this was a terrific purchase, especially for the very reasonable cost."

Compared to my Gloria Jeans grinder (RIP), it's really loud. And secondly, the lid inset is really long and is difficult to pull out when there is coffee in the device. The solution I've found is to minimize the amount of beans added to prevent spilling grinds when you are forcefully pulling the lid off."

Now that the old one broke, I replace it with this (for the same price), and this one is clearly superior.\nAs I learned reading reviews of blade grinders: to get the proper vortex, which is what pulls stuff from the top and pushes it from the bottom, creating an even grind, the blade must be turned in opposing directions on either end. This grinder, unlike many others, has the proper blade shape. I noticed the difference immediately.\nMy old grinder had a 'cable winding' area that didn't actually hold the cable. This one doesn't have a cable storage area, but I really don't care. I've never actually seen a cable storage system that worked in the kitchen. The only one I can think of that works is on my Rowenta iron.\n\nI use this mainly to grind spices like black peppercorns, allspice berries, and dried chilies, etc. My old grinder had the improper blade shape, which left me with chunks of seeds, chilies and such. This grinder grinds it all evenly. And it is the same price as most others. Buy this one if you're not sure."

Mistake. The features it had (for a similar price) were that you could measure the beans right in the coffee grinder and it automatically stoped grinding based on the amount of beans you have. Life was simple with that grinder.\nWith this KRUPS grinder you have to measure your beans yourself and it takes some calculating because it tells you how much beans per 5 ounces, not per cup. It is messy because you have to turn it upside down to get the grounds out in the cover. It collects moisture around the metal in the bottom, where grounds will stick, even when the grinder seems perfectly dry. It is easy to grind the beans into dust since it is a guess as to how long to grind the beans. It is not convenient to clean because you can't submerge it in water since the lid is the only removable part.\nThe only positive is that it is very quiet, but considering that it runs for mere seconds, it isn't an important feature for me. I want my noisy Hamilton Beach grinder back."

Unless you happen to get a defective unit, it will likely last you for decades in daily use - as many reviewers have indicated. We use a small brush (solder flux brush available at Home Depot for less than $1 to be exact) to sweep out all the coffee after each use.

Does an excellent job of giving anything from a coarse to a fine grind. Easy to operate. I do have two qualms, however:\n\n1) A lot of the coffee grounds will get stuck below the blade, and have to be removed with a finger, chopstick, etc. As the blade cannot be detached, it has to manually be moved during this process. It's a troublesome and very slightly dangerous process.\n\n2) While the removable lid cleans easily, the blade unit does not. You can probably get away with throwing some water into it, but I don't know how tight the sealing is, so I wouldn't advise it. Using a damp paper towel to wipe the inside down isn't ideal as the paper towel will never pick up 100% of the coffee grounds, but it's the best solution I've come up with thus far.\n\nDespite that, I would purchase this product again, but I'd also be lying if I told you I wasn't interested in purchasing a larger, more convenient unit."

Because I knew I would only use it on occasion, I opted not to go with a more expensive model. There are no bells and whistles to speak of. You will find little variation in the consistency of your grinds. This model is best suited for a fine grind. I tend to prefer a medium grind myself, but it does not pose a problem for the cone filters that my Cuisinart requires. If you're patient, a combination of short bursts and shaking the unit in-between can occasionally leave you with a coarse or medium grind, but more often than not I find it's inconsistent and more trouble than it's worth. If run for 5-10 seconds consecutively it creates a metallic scent that is quick to fade, but I have had no issue with the motor giving out. I would either use this unit for coffee or spices, not both. It is not built for an easy clean. Angled shape does help a bit with pouring grinds."

Other reviews have stated that you can only get a fine grind with this unit. Not true at all! They simply are not using it correctly. I can grind course, medium or fine after just a little practice. The only reason I left one star out is because when using fresh beans (which are oily) it takes one more step to clean it out so that your next grind doesn't include some stale coffee. Not being fully submersible makes this one more step I wish I didnt have to take. They should include a small brush to clean after each grind. Other than that, it has worked as good as I wanted it to and being a krups product I know I will never have an issue with customer service as they are accomodating even after warrantees have expired.

I finally figured out to fill the LID with the beans, flop the whole dang thing over and then put it right side up and it can grind the beans that way. To pour beans into the grinder, it is\u200b a total pain in the butt. It would only grind about half of what its capacity should be able to grind. If there's an easier way, someone please tell me. Because when I fill the reservoir with beans, I can't fit the lid on....because the beans are in the way and the lid won't latch down in there correctly. SO I do it upside down, flip it and grind them then."

However, one day when emptying the filter basket, the spring loaded valve mechanism came apart in my hand. I contacted Krups on their website explaining the problem. They answered promptly referring me to two different parts supply businesses, where I could BUY a new filter basket. Only one of the two companies listed my model number, so I ordered 2 baskets (being prepared for the future!) with same day shipping included. After that I heard nothing. After a week I contacted the parts company and was told that this filter basket was sold out nationally, and a new shipment was expected a month and a half from now! Considering the poor reliability of this part, I fully understand why it was sold out, but I consider the apparent lack of concern - both by Krups and the parts dealer - to be rather shoddy! And I can only hope that new baskets will include a better design."

You can't immerse the bottom but I used a wet rag to wipe it out after grinding the different spices; then air dry. And for coffee, maybe 15 or 20 seconds of pressing on the little button on top and your beans are fully ground. A little longer and you've got espresso grind."

I use this little grinder to grind lots of things from flax seed to spices and it always grinds extremely well! The only drawback that a potential buyer might want to consider would be the fact that even though the bowl of the grinder and blade are stainless steel it can be difficult to get rid of ALL of the smell from grinding pungent spices out of the grinder so the smell can transfer from one item to the next. (Example. Grinding Cumin and then washing the grinder and a few days later grinding flax seed) For this reason you might consider either avoiding those pungent spices alltogether or buying an additional grinder to use specifically for \"pungent grinding.\" At the end of the day, I believe you won't be disappointed with your purchase!"

Once you have ground the beans, getting the cover both off (without spillage) and back on (grinds in the way) is a task in itself. Third, yes this is an inexpensive machine. But the brand I was using before was both inexpensive and better designed; over time that may have changed and the newer versions may not work as it once did. I will see how long it takes for this machine to either break or for me to throw it across the room in exasperation."

            "reviewText": "The basics:\nThis inexpensive and compact spice and coffee grinder does its job well. I bought it looking for a way to grind spices, and it does so without any trouble.\n\nWhy I chose this product:\nI was using a recipe that called for ground poppy seeds and I tried everything I had in my home with no success. The food processor did not work - instead, it just pushed the poppy seeds around. The blender did not work - the same thing happened. The mortar and pestle did not help at all. Nothing I tried would break down these poppy seeds. I had heard that coffee grinders work well for grinding spices. Yes, I did have a coffee grinder for coffee, but I was also aware that you do not want to use the same machine for coffee beans and spices because the spices will most likely impart a certain flavor in your coffee, even after thorough cleaning. Therefore, I wanted a small and compact grinder specifically for spices, which also would not cost too much.\n\nHow it performed:\nThis one fit the bill and I ordered it. To my delight, it worked exactly as I had hoped. It ground the poppy seeds up perfectly and finely. It is easy to wipe clean with a paper towel. Occasionally, in order to clean it better, I fill it up to the blades with white rice and then finely grind it. Then, I dump the rice flour out and clean it with a dry paper towel. This helps remove some of the odor from the previously ground spices as well.\n\nFurther considerations:\nI could see this working well with coffee beans too, but it does not have any measurement lines on the inside of the cup for you to measure how much you are making without then using another measuring device to verify you are using the right amount.\n\nExact Dimensions, at the widest parts:\nHeight: 17 cm (6.7 inches)\nWidth: 7.8 cm (3.1 inches)\nCord length: about 29 inches\n\nTo know before I go:\nEven though I plan on using this grinder strictly for grinding spices, I feel it was definitely worth the purchase. It\u2019s very compact size does not take up too much space in my storage cabinets and the next time I need to grind a spice for any reason (freshly ground spices do emit such a wonderful aroma when cooking!), I will be glad I have this one."

Find a different one if you're afraid of loud noises that last up to 5 seconds, or just get over it. You're an adult."

For those that want to know, I get\u00a0Cameron's Toasted Southern Pecan Whole Bean Coffee, 32-Ounce Bag\u00a0and use a\u00a0Cuisinart DCC-1200 12-Cup Brew Central Coffeemaker, Black and Stainless Steel\n\nHere are a few things you should know:\n\n1. It needs to be plugged in.\n\n2. I'd say max capacity is around 8 scoops of whole coffee beans. Any more and you may overflow.\n\n3. Definitely get a grinder brush (looks like a basting brush) to clean out your grinder after each use. Or if you're lazy like me sometimes... every 2 - 3 uses. I wouldn't leave grounds in there more than 3 days though.\n\n4. Although this product was meant for a finer grounds or grinds... you can get a slightly coarser grind if you pulse it and shake it around a bit until you get to the grind you want. I dont know how uniform it will be but it works for me.\n\n5. It is pretty loud. Just pretend your blending ice cubes with a blender.\n\nOverall, I am very satisfied with the purchase. One more note is that I've been using the grinder 2 - 3 times a week for 3 months and it's still as strong as when I first used it. And... I would never use it for anything other than coffee beans (I don't want to contaminate my coffee). Hopefully my review helps."

            "reviewText": "I used to have a manual flaxseed grinder but I accidentally knocked it over last month and broke it. It worked well enough but it was always an effort to grind the flax and a lot of work only produced a little bit of product. Because I couldn't find a duplicate of the one I had, and because I am such a big fan of putting flax in my food for a variety of health benefits I decided to give this one a try.\n\nPerfect. It grinds the flax up in no time. In fact, I ended up with more ground flax than I needed so I keep the leftover bits in a container in the refrigerator. (For those not familiar with flaxseed your body really only benefits from the seed being freshly ground up and not eaten whole.)\n\nSo I've found my perfect flaxseed grinder.\n\nNeedless to say, this works great on coffee as well, but the test for any grinder is flaxseed because it's so small and hard yet this Krups grinder worked like a charm.\n\nHighly highly recommended. And easy to clean to boot."

The only feature it is missing is the fact that it will not meter the water. Unlike the bean hopper it will use all the water you put in it regardless of how many cups you program. Not a big deal but the reason I shorted it the 5th star. Aside from that the grinder works great and the steam is kept out of the grinding area.

Pressed the power and BAM! Almost no noise! I was afraid this was going to be a buzz saw, but its not. Very very quiet. Not silent, but very low noise. I pulsed the power button a couple of times to distribute the seeds in the mill then let it run steady for about thirty or so seconds. The result? Flax seed flour. I put a half teaspoon in my mouth to taste it and their wasn't the slightest bit of grit! Fine fine flour in under a minute. Its not that hard to get the flour out but it does adhere to the inside bottom of the chamber. A wonderful device. If you need it, get it."

            "reviewText": "I have used several coffee grinders and this is the best, fastest and most quiet thus far. It will grind about 1/2 cup of beans at one time. To use, simply lift the top off, add the beans, replace the top and push on the black lever until you achieve the grind you want. You can use either a pulsing motion, or just hold the lever down. Compared to other grinders, I find this one a bit quieter--the sound comes from the grinding of the coffee rather than from the motor of the grinder. It grinds very quickly and it is small so it doesn't take much counter space.\n\nOnly downside is that some of the grounds cling to the lid, making it a bit messy when you remove it...you'll need to wipe the counter, but not a big deal. It is easier to dump the ground coffee directly from the grinder into your filter, rather than use a spoon to remove it. The blade is exposed and makes it awkward to use a spoon or scoop."

I was expecting a very coarse grind, but to my pleasant surprise, I found that I can get a very nice fine grind! Other nice things about it: small and compact makes for simple storage. It is easy to clean. It is really not that loud for a grinder. The only downside is that it seems to be a fairly small capacity. BUT, I tend to only grind 1-2 pots of coffee worth at a time anyways, just to keep it fresh. So while that is not a con for me personally, others may find it inconvenient."

I bought this after reading mostly positive reviews, but have been a little disappointed so far. The grind is far more inconsistent than my previous Cuisinart grinder. It grinds faster than the Cuisinart, but the grounds come out very varied in size. If I grind for about 12 seconds, the grounds come out very fine (nearly perfect for espresso, though!), but going any less and some grounds are super fine, and some are nearly whole chunks. I'm not sure if it's the oval shape of the grinder or the difference in blade speeds or what, but I think I may bust out the super glue and try to piece together my old one...\n\nI may keep this one since it was relatively cheap, and I do make espresso every once in a while - but if you're looking for a grinder to make varied ground sizes like I was (I percolate when I go camping, make drip most mornings, and the occasional latte), I'd look somewhere else."

The coffee grinds I would get from Starbucks would go stale in 2 weeks!\n\nI was cruising through Amazon.com when I found this little machine for $20.\n\nThis is perfect for a person living by himself needing to make fresh coffee grinds once in awhile, without compromising any flavor from the coffee beans. Its small and light enough so you can move it around and not make it a permanent fixture in the kitchen. It can grind anywhere from coarse to fine. Surprisingly quieter than I expected. Also requires you to place the cap on top so you won't chop your fingers off by mistake.\n\nI guess the only small, tiny gripe I have is that no part of it besides the cap is removable for easy cleaning. However, I use it as a dedicated coffee grinder, so I like to keep it dry and generally just clean the cap and tap any excess grind out if using new beans. Not too much of a problem.\n\nThe cord is also short as other reviewers point out, again not a problem for me who lives in a small apartment.\n\nUsing it with the fill-your-own keurig cup adapters make pretty good and strong coffee. Haven't tried it yet with the french press but I have no doubt it will yield good results.\n\nCheap, powerful, space efficient, and yielding good results. Can't complain."

Also, when you put stuff in (I grind dried herbs too), the cap will catch it when you put it in and keep it from being ground. And finally, when the motor runs, you can smell the oil from the motor. Not happy at all."

            "reviewText": "I bought this grinder for multiple purposes, to grind spices and coffee. For spices it's great, for coffee it's okay, it gets the job done. It's difficult to get a good consistent grind on coffee beans. If you pulse it a couple times before holding the button down for a 4 to 5 second count it does a decent job. But if you're particular about your coffee grind, save up for a burr type grinder. It's also a little difficult to clean out since the base doesn't come apart. I end up using a can of compressed air to dust out the big stuff and a damp paper towel to wipe out what's left.\n\nThe unit itself is very well built, rugged and should last a long time from what I can tell. It appears to be identical to the one my parents have been using for 30+ years, which was the whole reason I bought this model in the first place."

I used to use the store grinder but one store removed theirs and in another store I had the unfortunate experience of adding the residue of a previous users spiced product into my own pure Colombian beans. Yuck! I had to discard the whole bag. So I thought about getting my own grinder but hesitated because I know that loud noise would only contribute to my slight hearing loss. But then I came up with the bright idea that I would use earplugs, just as I do to filter out my husband's snoring. After checking out the on line Amazon reviews I selected the Krups, which is a brand I trust. I decided to go with a small grinder in the interests of saving counter space and because I am the only coffee drinker in my home. I'm completely satisfied with this product and look forward to grinding fresh beans first thing in the morning."

I use it for so much though: black pepper, red pepper flakes (really brings out the heat), spices that I've toasted whole, super-fine sugar and salt. The only draw back I've noticed is that to get all the chunks out of your spices you really have to grind them for a while. If the motor runs for more than 5 seconds or so it starts to smell a little funny and I'm afraid I'm going to burn it out. To avoid this, I usually pulse my spices to get them really fine.\n\nTip for getting your spices out: turn the whole grinder upside down, tap the sides to loosen the spices, and let it sit upside down for a minute to let any dust settle (really important if its black or red pepper - not trying to breathe in that dust, ouch). Then remove the cap and its must easier to use what you've ground."

It will not grind really thick pieces of cinnamon bark, but has ground up most of the cinnamon I put in it, just had to fish out the really thick chunks. It handled my garam masala mix just fine.

The grind is a bit uneven, less so if you pulse rather than hold down the button. I would recommend filling whole beans to the blade only (which is about 3 tbp). The more coffee there is in the machine, the more uneven the grind. The grinds also cling to the plastic top so it is very messy whenever you open it but that seems to be common with blade grinders. You get what you pay for and for this price, I can live with the inconveniences. I have never used a grinder before but reading the poor reviews for other blade machines I am happy with the purchase. If you intend to grind fresh coffee every morning it may be worth it to invest in a burr grinder. When I upgrade, I will use this for spices."

Anyway, enough about the reasons why you should get a grinder. If you're even reading this out of the 600 other reviews, you already know that a grinder is for you. As for which one, well for this price from a well-known company in the coffee industry, your search has come to an end. This is my first grinder but let me tell you, I was impressed on the power and speed in which it grounded up some coffee beans! As for design, I was equally impressed on how the cover has a little notch attached to the button to trigger the motor once the cover was attached to the unit. This is a great safety feature so that it's extremely difficult to activate the blades with the cover off. To sum things up, if you need a grinder... look now further, here it is.

How fine the coffee is ground is entirely dependent on how long the grinder's button is pressed.\n\nFor coarse coffee, simply grind it for less time by \"pulsing,\" just like using a food processor. The motor is only active as long as the button is pressed. For very fine coffee, keep it pressed until you pulverize the beans.\n\nI grind my coffee for use with a permanent filter as well as a French press. It does take some skill to coarsely grind the beans versus just holding the button down for a fine blend. But after a few tries, you'll get it down. Just practice with some cheap beans.\n\nThe grinder is easy to maintain since the liner that holds the beans is made of metal and is enclosed. With a quick rinse and a paper towel you can wipe it clean and it's ready to go for the next morning."

It is very true that grinding your own beans improves the flavor immensely. I decided to invest in my own grinder and did a lot of research before selecting this brand. Most of the complaints are concerning the cloud of coffee dust that flies out when you take the top off - I noticed that happening when I grind my beans very finely - ie, for an espresso maker. Grinding for a lot time does create a vacuum but there is an easy fix - if you wiggle the lid slowly to let some of the air in, the cloud dust does not occur. As for me, when I am in a hurry in the morning I forget and end up with a little spilt coffee granules but its no big deal. The motor is only a little noisy when you first put whole beans in but once the beans are broken down there is less rattling. Also if you are wary of waking up roommates/spouse/etc I find that if you pick up the grinder so it is not vibrating against the counter, it also creates less noise. The blade is pretty sharp and I can grind beans enough for 1-2 cups in less than a minute. I am definitely going to buy a 3rd (for myself) to grind spices."

If you want fine grounds, spring for a burr grinder, but if you enjoy coffee more than the average bear but aren't a connoisseur, this grinder is a good compromise. I also recommend buying a small brush to help get the grounds out of the grinder. I bought one with a wooden handle to dislodge the packed ground that form just outside of the blade's arc, then flipped the brush around to sweep them out. Seems to work well that way. My only complaint is that every time I use this grinder, there is a faint \"electric motor\" smell to it. But don't worry, mine hasn't caught fire or anything, just gives off a short-lived odor."

There was nothing in the instructions. I finally realized that it pulls straight up. However, the fit to the body of the machine is so tight that I had to fight with it to get it off. I have a fair amount of arthritis in my hands so this posed quite a challenge. Next, it did an OK job grinding. The grind was inconsistent as opposed to the Cuisinart which was pretty uniform. Third, due to the design, when you remove the top, coffee grinds end up all over the place. What a mess! Needless to say, I returned this. I don't think I'll be buying any Krups products based on this experience."

The plastic cover got stained from the coffee some, though I cleaned it regularly but it does its job well. I would buy this again if I needed another. Fast shipping too."

I decided to try whole bean coffee one day and at the time i did not have a grinder so I just grinded the coffee at the store i bought the coffee from. It had better taste then the pre-ground, so i decided to switch to whole bean and even buy my own grinder. This was rated the top seller so i bought it instead of trying to figure out which one worked better.. I have had this for almost a year and I love it, It works great, its not super loud, its easy to clean, and i will never go back to pre-ground!"

Easy to control the texture so if you need it ground for a press you can do that easily and if you needed it finer, its great for that as well. I've used for chopping nuts for holiday cookies and it worked great for those as well. It is very easy to clean. I just use a paper towl and wipe it out after every use. Certain beans have more moisture in them, so I usually leave the grinder out for the morning to air out when grinding those. Great grinder at a great price."

It does a fantastic job turning the shells into a powder which is then sprinkled onto food. (NOTE that should you use your grinder for eggshells, you need to know / research safe and healthy ways to handle farm fresh eggs so as not to contaminate your grinder etc.)"

            "reviewText": "This coffee grinder is exactly what I expected it to be with one exception. It's slim profile was a welcome surprise! I already have a million appliances on my kitchen counter so I really like that it is so slim and compact. It doesn't take up much space and fits perfectly tucked in between my toaster and my knife block.\n\nWhen I first tried it out I thought it was odd that I couldn't control the grind size. Then I realized that it's all in how long you hold down the grind button. The longer you press the button, the finer the grind. I can get a coarse grind in about 4 seconds and a really fine grind in about 10. It's super quick and easy. So weather I'm using a standard coffee pot, or my French Press, I always get the right grind for the job.\n\nThe cord isn't super long, but it's not super short either. I found it was adequate length to give me several options in positioning it on my countertop.\n\nMy only complaint (if I had to come up with one) is clean up. It's kind of a hassle. However, I think this is indicative of all coffee grinders and not just this one. I just took a wet paper towel and wiped it out which seemed to work well enough.\n\nOverall, I am really glad I bought this one and would definitely recommend it to a friend. For the price especially, I can't imagine anything better.\n\nI absolutely rely on reviews to help me figure out which products to buy so I hope this review helps!"

            "reviewText": "It looks nice and grinds coffee beans. The size of the grind is far from uniform. This is expected as there is no mechanism to remove particles that are already small enough. The grinds acquire a static charge and get everywhere. Perhaps a burr grinder would work better in this regard, especially if the entire housing were metal.\n\nMy goal was better flavor by grinding my own. I noticed no change in flavor, compared to store ground, vacuum packed coffee. I don't claim that there is no difference, just that I don't notice it when rushing at 6 AM. I'm sticking with pre-ground for now."

It might take you a couple of tries to get your coffee or spices ground to the consistency you are looking for but that is one of the reasons I like this model. If you pulse it a few times you can have coarse black pepper or grind until you are down to a VERY fine powder. Perfect for cooking. I also use it for coffee and have had no issues. I would have to disagree with other reviews that say it is hard to clean or that it is poorly constructed. I just lightly rinse out the grinding bowl and lid when I'm done, hand dry and it is clean and ready to go again. I also haven't had issues with cross contaminating my coffee with spices. All you have to do is clean it (and that is not difficult). Good Value."

More importantly, it is a nightmare to clean. The instructions state to brush it out with a brush. Nope. I also grind up enough beans for a few days, so it takes quite a few times filling up the grinder since it is a small capacity. Every time I took the clear cover off to empty and refill the grinder, coffee gets all over the counter.\nI used this once this morning, and am back onto Amazon to pick out a new grinder!\nThe grinder did grind the coffee beans well, but there is more to a grinder than just the grinding abilities."

This grinder seems solidly built and certainly grinds beans quickly and effectively. However, its volume was far too small for our needs and grinding routinely results in a portion of the grounds (about 1/5 of the cup's volume) adhering to the bottom of the grinder cup. Because the cup itself is not removable (a high volume lid substitutes for a removable grinder cup), this requires using something to loosen the grounds from the cup and turning the grinder upside down. The whole process is messy and, because we prefer more volume, we have to repeat twice for every pot of coffee. From other reviews, I infer that we prefer a larger volume of grounds than do others and so perhaps the volume won't be a problem for most."

This thing runs smooth and I'm very confident it'll last years to come.\nI consider myself to be pretty picky about quality. First thing I did was to see if the blades were loose. Nope, of course not. It's Krupps, European, they don't mess around.\nOh yeah, and it's safe as heck. You push the top to activate the blades. No chance of stuff flying out or fingers going in."

I like it just fine, putting in three of those small conical scoops of beans into it, grinding for about 15 seconds, and pouring plus digging the resultant powder out with a tiny stiff brush. I use the paper filters and am very happy with the result. I judge that this design will last forever, because it works like a blender.\n\nI just put a spare Krups in my cart for a spare.

Appearance is clean and easy on the eyes. Recommend black as it doesn't look dirty after grinding coffee. Reliable. Not expensive.\nCons: If you require a thoroughly consistent grain size in your ground coffee, seek another more expensive device. Difficult to clean after using it for grinding nuts or spices. Loud enough to stop conversation throughout the room. Unit gave off \"burning electrical insulation\" smell when used during the first week, so I watched it carefully and prepared to return it as defective. Then the unit quit putting out that smell and has been performing well since.\nSummary: I would recommend this unit to a friend.\nCWG_2009-10-15"

The grind is fine for the typical pour over type pot that I have been using since the late 70s, they are automated now but the principle is the same.

On the manual it says it is to avoid the cord to get tangled or so...I say it is to save money on the cord on their side..."

I bought this grinder and you had to guesstimate the fineness of the grind, hold until it was done and make a mess while trying to get the coffee out of the chamber. So I looked again on Amazon and found the Melitta Coffee Grinder (model 80391) and it addressed all of these issues for $10 more and looked much better to boot. It has a fineness adjustment, on/off switch, adjustable length cord and removable coffee chambers that this doesn't have. Not sure why this grinder has son many more reviews, must be the price. Save yourself the cost of having to purchase another one and just buy the Melitta first instead."

I was leery of a blade grinder but this is giving me a very even fine grind for my pour-over coffee. Have been using it daily since it arrived. I use a \"pulse\" method of grinding until I get the grind I want, and brush it out carefully after each use with a 1\" soft bristle brush. Clean it with a soapy sponge every couple of days. Very satisfied with this so far (daily use--sometimes twice a day--for about a month now). It seems like it will be durable, but if it isn't, I'll come back to update this."

These machines are absolute junk, and the only reason I keep purchasing them is because it costs more to have them repaired than to buy them, which seems, more and more, to be true of small appliances in general, but this is a particularly egregious case.

I have had the older model 4 cup for over 15 years and it still works.\n\nThis model is slightly larger and can take more beans, likely for at least 8 cups.\n\nIt feels and sounds like the older model, so likely it will be very reliable ... my old 1980s bought model still works well. AC motors are far better than DC battery models: strong, powerful and reliable. Black is a good color, hides dirt better!\n\nCons:\n\nThe cord is far shorter than the original, and it can be a minor hassle if AC sockets are not in easy reach. The cord has no storage area but being shorter, is less in the way.\n\nThe grinder cover can be dishwashed, but the metal bowl cannot be removed. You'll need to clean out grounds with a spatula or brush, just like the older model. The bowl is not a tightest fit like the older model. There is a tiny gap between the plastic body and the bowl that could leak fine grinds, over time, into the housing that later gums up the motor.\n\nLike many things plastic, the cover-lid will eventually break with use. Overtime, my older grinder lid edges chipped away. Recently, a crack appeared on the top, but not bad enough to leak grinds. It would be best if the lid were made of metal. Add a small glass window to see the grind, and the grinder could last forever. The wear on my old grinder cap is a reason for buying this new Krups grinder.\n\nThese are small prices to pay for a good product.\n\nPerfection for this grinder? Change the following:\n\nRemovable dishwasher safe bowl\nMetal lid with glass window\nStowage area with self retracting cord\n\nIt may cost more, but will last forever."

In just seconds -- in mere single digits of seconds -- it reduces big ol' gnarly coffee beans to fine dust, ready to put into the filter. This fast-grinding is a real plus if you live with other people who don't get up so early in the morning, because you don't make coffee-grinding noises for more than a few seconds, and your slothful housemates can sleep in.\n\nI've been through several coffee grinders before I got to this one. The first had a switch go bad, and for years I was turning it on with the point of a ballpoint pen. Even then, it was very slow (and noisy) in grinding coffee: 20 seconds of grinding left me with something about the consistency of gravel. The second grinder (whose brand-name, by the way, is the same as that of a very well-known chain of coffee shops) mysteriously gave up the ghost -- just plain quit working, with no warning signs. But this Krups grinder looks like a keeper. I've been using it for several years now, and I have nothing but praise for it."

Honestly, I don't recall if, 20 years ago, I decided that super-fine needed that, but it's what I do all the time, even if making a coarser grind for the odd drip-cone cup of coffee. My shaking has been, I believe, responsible for a wire inside coming loose, so once when it stopped working I opened it up, found the loose wire, and reconnected it. Very simple wiring inside. Blades are still sharp, the lid has a few chips in it but so do I after 20 years.\n\nI'm reviewing this product now since I'm going to buy a new one soon, to have in the wings should my old one simply give up the ghost one day after I shook it just a bit too much...and I can't bear the consequences of not being able to grind my morning beans if that happens. I've shopped around a bit and looked at what is out there these days, and decided I'm just going to go for exactly the same one -- don't need the Star-Trek Enterprise model coffee grinder (in fact, I bought one of those once for a field station, where it got used less than once-a-day, and it irreparably died after a couple of years....so I bought a Krups for the station instead and it's doing fine)."

I usually give it a quick wipe with a clean finger to free up the coffee that has stuck. I expect it has to do with moisture in the coffee beans. There's a stainless steel bowl in the bottom and plastic sides so I don't know what more could be done about this problem.

            "reviewText": "For what it's advertised as, it's a great product. I have a French Press and should've bought a burr grinder so that I could get a coarser grind. This grinder doesn't have any settings that allow for that; it's controlled by grinding the beans for a shorter or longer period of time. I find that grinding them for a short time doesn't produce consistent grind size, but I also wasn't expecting that. Grinding the beans for a longer period produces consistently fine grounds. Sure, I spill a little powder on the counter when transferring them to the press and I worry that cleaning the machine with the nozzle from my faucet will damage the motor, but for $20 and an impulse buy, this is a great little bean grinder."

Since course ground coffee tastes richer and not bitter I like the touch feature that allows me to grind for however many seconds I want.\nGreat coffee grinder works fast and is really easy to clean small for storage - we take it in our RV on vacation. Definitely one of the best grinders I've ever had and I would recommend it to anyone who likes fresh ground coffee in the morning. Very good price for a superior product!"

No matter how long you grind the beans for you will only get out a portion of what you put in. And what I mean is that the ground coffee all sticks to the inside and you have to wipe out most of it with a napkin after each grind. I don't like that you cannot remove the inside basket either. It grinds the beans to a nice texture but I would not buy this again."

Again, relying on the positive Amazon reviews, I chose the Krups 203-42. It's a handsome, sturdy tool and I find it easy to use, easy to clean. With a single button, in seconds, I can grind the beans to any texture I want--from regular to expresso; however, there's no controlling guide, just intuition. I don't find this a problem. Although some others have suggested multiple use options, I'm not sure I'll use it for anything other than coffee beans since I've already discovered the beans are very oily and would probably pick up spice scents not apparent--even after a good cleaning. At this price, I think it will be wiser to buy another for the spices."

            "reviewDate": "September 15, 2011",
            "reviewText": "I don't like too fine of a grind since I am using a Yama vacuum coffee siphon. It seems to gum up together and make a nice soup so that it takes too long for the brewed coffee to filter down into the carafe. So to make a less fine grind, merely grind it for about 10 to 20 seconds less than you would normally do. You can hear the sound as you grind getting less and less 'grinding' and just the motor and blades spinning. You want to stop it when you look down and see some nice coarse grounds but you can still hear the grinding sound. I know it sounds very non-technical.... but it works.\n\nOtherwise, it does very well for a fine grind (useful for those who have metal filters or use cloth filters). Even though it grinds finely, it's inexpensive and of course, in my opinion:\n\n>>>>> There is no better way to enjoy coffee than to grind it directly before brewing!\n\nI have done several side by side comparisons with fresh, one day old, two day old, and one week old (stored in mason jar) coffee beans in a french press (for consistency) and the difference is huge. Day old coffee you lose some of the more powerful and fresh aromatics, but the inherent nature of the coffee is preserved. Two days you lose a tad bit of the acidity, a little more aromatics, and some of the body. After one week the actual flavor has changed and it gets a somewhat stale taste. Aromatics are not only reduced, but changed.\n\nSo the verdict: grind just before brewing, even if your beans have been sitting in a vacuum bag for weeks. The inherent flavors, aromas, and texture are all in the core of the bean. The actual roast and surface oils are all you risk changing/losing from un-ground beans. Store unground beans in a sealed, preferably vacuum sealed, container or zip loc bag. DO NOT STORE IN FREEZER!!!!!!!! Just put in a cabinet in the dark.\n\nI know it seems like a bit of trouble to do all of this, but if you don't care about the flavor of the coffee, then you probably wouldn't be looking at a grinder anyway...\n\n----------\n\nUpdate 10/18:\n\nSo the grinder ended up with a problem: for some reason it wouldn't turn off unless unplugged. I checked the little button where the lid pushes down and it was fine. Moved okay, was not depressed when the lid was off. So I took the bottom off and loosened the screws on the small circuit board under the plastic piece that forms the little button. Apparently the piece was just pushing tightly on the little see-saw lever used to hit the board and activate the motor. So two turns later it wasn't running 100% of the time while plugged in. Presto!\n\nOh and a funny, comedic note. I found out the hard way... I had put the beans in before plugging it in, hadn't put the lid on yet either... So I got a coffee bean explosion! And I had to chase my dog out of the kitchen because he apparently likes Stumptown Guatemalan... So know I either put the lid on before plugging in or put the beans in after it's plugged in and I make sure the problem doesn't come up again!"

The lid comes off and is dishwasher safe (don't remember if it says that specifically but I've run mine through the dishwasher a dozen or more times), but the unit itself comes into direct contact with the spices and does not disassemble. That means wet paper towels and 5 minutes of cleaning after each use to prevent buildup and contamination. Not awesome. I still use it, and it still performs perfectly after almost a year. That really says something, as the market for these appliances is saturated with semi-disposable trash. I'll keep using it until it dies because it works so well, but I wouldn't buy another one to replace it I don't think. Find one that's easier to clean."

Wipe the grinder out with a damp paper towel and then dry. Once you've got the big chunks out, fill the grinder with 3-4 Tbsp of white rice and grind that up. Repeat the cleaning methodology above and you should be good to go."

I had an opportunity to borrow the Cuisinart DBM-8 Supreme Grind Automatic Burr Mill from a friend of mine. This grinder is a burr grinder and does not heat up the beans. The grinds are consistent and the coffee comes out great. The price was also well worth it at only $40 it is barely twice the price of the blade grinder.

That said, this puppy did it well enough for use in my single- cup Aeropress (which I love) and I've been totally satisfied in that regard, no question. But that's about it.\n\nThen why my 2 star reasoning?\n\n- The top fits tightly, which is surely good while during the grinding process, but then because of that, pulling it off to get at the grinds when completed is a real bitch for no matter how carefully I do it, fine grinds end up all over the kitchen counter top.\n\n- It is verrrrry difficult to pour the ground beans out once the job is done. The grinding chamber is not removeable so I have to unplug tgrinder and lug the whole thing over to the sink so that I can hopefully pour the grinds directly from it into the coffee maker. I say\"hopefully\"because most of the time only about half the ground coffee comes out this way. The rest I have to remove with a small plastic spoon (don't wanna damage the blades with a metal one). And even then, quite a bit still sticks to the inside of the plastic grinding area so I hafta flip the spoon and using the other end, kinda scrape the remainder out.\n\n- Again, because it is one-piece and therefore not water immersible, you can't wash the grinding chamber out to clean it thoroughly. Not good.\n\nWell there ya go. Those are my reasons for the 2 star rating and now it's back to the drawing board as I'll be ordering another different one. Prob'ly will take a chance with either The Mr. Coffee or the Epica, both about the same price and both having decent reviews re: doing the job, removing the finished grinds and cleaning the whole thing up. In any case, c'est la vie with this one, I guess..."

            "reviewText": "This grinder is on its way back to Amazon. My excellent HB 80374 coffee grinder broke after 2 years of use. It worked well but the previous one quit in less than 2 years so I decided it was time to try a different coffee grinder. Most of the reviews for this Krups model F203 were very good. For me it simply didn't work. I dumped in the beans (maybe half full) and pressed the button to grind. Counted 5 seconds and tried to see inside. Couldn't see a thing. Pulled off the lid and had a nice spray of coarsely ground coffee beans all over my counter. Sighed and wiggled the lid to get it back on. Pressed and counted another 5 seconds. Took about 5 minutes to pry the lid off this time. When it finally came off, I had more grounds all over the counter and some on the floor. And it still wasn't ground quite finely enough for my electric drip coffee maker! Decided I'd likely never be able to remove the lid again so I'd better quit and clean up. One can wash the clear top, but brushing and wiping are all that one can do to clean the blade area reservoir. Perhaps my kitchen has a greater degree of static than other places, but brushing the coffee grounds did not seem to remove them at all, even though I was holding the grinder upside-down over the sink. A couple damp paper towels eventually got it clean. I cannot imagine this hassle and mess each time I grind coffee, even if I managed to grind it to the necessary fineness in one try. Am going to try a conical burr grinder next. It promises less static, easy cleanup, and a consistent grind!"

Prior to purchasing this grinder I had done considerable research and read dozens of reviews of various blade and burr grinders in many price ranges. I decided to purchase a hand-grind burr grinder that I returned to the vendor after only two uses because it was too difficult to use. I then purchased an electric blade grinder that I returned to that vendor when after only two weeks of grinding beans for one cup of coffee per day it began to produce an inconsistent grind. One of the blades was bent! That's when I re-read the numerous reviews for the Krups F203 grinder. At the risk of sounding like Goldilocks, this grinder is \"just right.\" I love it! It's extremely easy to use and to clean and it produces a nice consistent grind for the pour over coffee method I use. I wish I had purchased this grinder in the first place!"

If you want very finely ground, then hold how the button for a second or two (seriously) and done.\n\nGetting the grounds out isn't hard; I flip it over and remove the cap, which makes a handy receptacle for the grounds.

I bought this to use with a cold brewer, which requires a courser grind. I grind for about 3-4 seconds, and I would say 75% of the grounds are the correct size. The other 25% fills the spectrum, however, from a fine grind to whole bean. Literally, every time I grind, I'll have to sift through the grounds for 6 or 7 beans that have yet to even touch the blades. I have used the device on a variety of surfaces, at work and home, and it consistently fails to grind evenly. It does the job, so I won't be returning it, but it does require extra steps if you want to get the most out of your coffee."

The top is a very tight fit and take some effort getting it off to the point that coffee is spilled in the process. I have used it four times and it has not improved yet. Hopefully it will get better the more I use it. We have had many Krups products ( coffee machines and grinders) in the past with no issues, so this one was a surprise."

Well after spending quite a lot on a good quality name brand bur grinder it ended up breaking after just 4 months of normal use. We have since gone back to this grinder and will never stray again. We never did feel that the bur grinder provided better taste, we believe that is simply a myth."

I have a burr grinder for my coffee and it's quite a chore to clean...many pieces to remove and dig around at with a brush. I was told burr grinders give more \"uniform\" grind, which it does...but I've found that with my spices, it seems very uniform with this KRUPS 203-42 and I'm tempted to use it for coffee some time."

            "reviewText": "I bought this thing's great granddaddy about the time it first appeared in the 1980s; I still have it and use it. The design is little changed except that in the new one the chamber about which the blade whirs is more rounded; the pulverized powder does not stick as badly to the sides. But there is the rub, it still does stick. This necessitates the application of a forefinger to dislodge the precious tiny granules from under the blade - owie alert!! Why does Krups not include a small brush that might reside in a holder on the side? Why don't I look for said brush somewhere myself? And this brings up another problem; the coffee is either too fine or too course - no in-between. This can make the coffee either a bit more bitter than it needs to be or a bit weak. How do you solve this problem - buy a good burr grinder for a lot more dough. If you are a real coffee aficionado (or affectianado), pop for a better grinder and the blissful beans from Orens for Sunday brunch. But those grinders are slow and expensive. This thing costs less now than it did in the 80's when adjusted for inflation and on a Tuesday morning when you are in a hurry, the noise (akin to the run-up of a 747) wakes you up before the coffee even starts brewing. Bonus! Our kat leaves the room meowing in complaint at the high frequency. But that means the grinding process is fast - in 10 seconds you have disintegrated every bean into something the consistency of fairy dust and you are ready for that soothing glug-a-luga sound of the drip coffee maker. Just add some cream if it is a little bitter. So for a cut above the ground Folgers in the three pound tub, buy this thing and some whole bean 8-O'clock and have a decent cup of joe for just slightly more money.\n\nSo bottom line - yes, it is well worth the money. Buy it, just don't expect more out of it than it can provide."

With that being said it should be made clear that I'm reviewing the blade grinder, not the burr grinder that is also offered in this listing. The blade grinder is poorly designed. Once the coffee is ground it is impossible to get the grounds into the coffee maker without spilling them (and wasting them) all over the counter/floor because as soon as the lid is removed the grounds spill- whether it's upside down or right side up when you remove the lid, it doesn't matter coffee will go everywhere. I tried pouring the grounds directly from the grinder into the coffee maker as well as pouring them from the lid into the coffee maker- mess either way. If you like cleaning up coffee grounds whilst having your morning cuppa joe then this is the grinder for you. Enjoy."

            "reviewText": "It starts like this: my parents grind coffee every single morning. I watched them do it all throughout high school. I didn't really understand what the difference was, nor did I really care all that much about it. Then I got to college and bought cheap, pre-ground coffee from the store. Then I understood. I haven't gotten around to buying this, and my own coffee beans until this year, but I will say that this is perfect and allows me to grind and brew much better coffee than offered in the pre-ground section at the store.\n\nNote: I've had this grinder for about two weeks now. First grinder I've owned. I've only used one other grinder (my parents, which is pretty old). In other words, this is a simple review, with no professional coffee maker/brewer base to it. I'm in college, to say the least. Just trying to be a little sophisticated, or something like that.\n\nAs far as the construction of this grinder, it's perfect. Yeah, it says you can grind other things inside of it, but I don't bake or anything so I have no need for it, other than grinding almonds for my oatmeal in the morning, which turned out to be one of my best decisions next to buying the grinder itself. It's a solid machine. Doesn't make too much noise for my five suite mates or apartment roomies or whatever you want to call them. They also use it for their own coffee as well. It holds the perfect amount of beans, and grinds them very well and efficiently.\n\nFunctionality- its perfect, for me at least. I just want to grind coffee so it can taste better. That's it. I'm not into the whole \"fine grind, coarse grind\" thing. I don't particularly care if the coffee beans are ground to a dust. It still goes into the coffee machine, in the filter, and I don't find chunks in my coffee. Sometimes it misses a bean or something, but there were like thirty other beans in there that got ground up so I'm not really missing much in my mind.\n\nLastly- cleaning the thing. Cleaning is not a fun thing. I don't do it frequently, partially because it's not needed and partially because it's somewhat of a pain, as it would be with any grinder. The coffee sticks to the bottom of it sometimes, meaning I gotta get in there and rotate the blade to get to it all without cutting myself. This is not specific to this grinder, but just is a general statement about cleaning grinders in general. Not a big deal though; it's well worth it in my mind. The clear plastic piece is easy to clean, though. No issues with that at all. A little hot water and it's all good to go.\n\nAgain, I'm no coffee connoisseur, but this does what I need it to do, and I get better tasting coffee because of it. I'll update this review if something goes astray. Hope this helps somebody!"

            "reviewText": "Replaced a really old grinder of similar type by Cusinart, This one works great and I like it since it has a larger capacity for beans so I can grind more at once. Of course the grind depends on how long you hold the button down. I like mine ground fine for an espresso machine. Some powder tends to cake under the blades. I have developed a habit of holding it up when I push the button and tilt it sideways back and forth during grinding to facilitate mixing. One would do well to count the seconds for the grind you like so to be more consistent over time. I believe it takes about 10 seconds to get to a fine enough grind. After done I put the gound coffee into a small can making a day or two's worth at one time so it is always fresh. One needs to use their finger or another object to get the caked product out of the bottom but it is not a big deal. It is easy to clean with a paper towel around the inside tapping the remainder out. I found a small brush which I use to get grind out of the crevasses. Overall I find it is a great value and works well for small portions."

After a few uses, however, I'm completely unsatisfied and will be getting a manual burr grinder instead. This grinder cannot achieve consistent ground size- what that means is that some of your beans will still be in very large chunks, while most of the beans are pulverized. That is literally the one important hallmark of a coffee grinder- that it grinds the beans to a consistent grind. Maybe the inconsistent results are fine for people using a drip coffee maker, but if you want to use this grinder to brew a precise cup of coffee, definitely look elsewhere."

The original one was made in Mexico, the new one in China. They seem to be the same, except for one critical thing: The new one has a much shorter power cord! So, if your counter top outlet is not convenient, then this coffee grinder may not be the right one for you (unless you want to add an extension cord). I find that I have to un-plug the grinder first, after I grind my coffee beans, so as to empty the chamber, rather than maintaining the cord and plug in place. I find this extra step annoying. Other than that, it grinds great, is very powerful, and the oval shape makes pouring the ground coffee from the unit very easy and nearly spill free."

I used it for years and years and, despite gross negligence (on my part, I didn't take care of it, banged it around) and multiple apartment moves, had the same grinder which worked perfectly every time. Blades never dulled either. Was a small miracle of sorts.\n\nThen in a move I LOST the old Krups grinder and went Krup grinderless (bought pre-ground coffee) for years. Last week, I accidentally ordered 5 pounds of BEANS instead of grounds and figured ok now is my excuse to get another Krups.\n\nWell this Krups seems even more well constructed than the last one. Like decades ago, I look at my watch, time 5 seconds, and whatdoyaknow, it makes exactly the same coarse grounds it did decades ago.\n\nOnly thing I would differ with some of the reviews is that 'it's not loud.' It's SO LOUD, I get a kick out of scaring the cats right out of the kitchen when they are bothering me to feed them in the morning.\n\nSo I have my old friend the Krups coffee grinder back and am very pleased.\n\n:)"

            "reviewDate": "June 8, 2014",
            "reviewText": "I like this product for many reasons - small, sleek looking, light, strong. The material feels fantastic holding in hands, definitely in good quality. It is also very safe to use among small kitchen appliances, as you would have to have the lid fully closed to operate the blade. We use it every morning for coffee, and it does a good job grinding coffee beans into fine ground.\n\nIt is not very easy to clean comparing to a food processor, because the base, where the coffee beans go into, cannot be rinsed under water. The instruction suggests to wipe it clean with dampen cloth. Since I could not figure out how to detach the blade from the base (the manual also does not indicate how, so it is probably not possible), I have to use a paint brush to sweep the inside. It is not a problem for us since we only use it for coffee beans, but if you also want to use it for herbs and spices, the sweeping can be some work.\n\nSpeaking of grinding herbs, it is a perk of this device and part of the reason I bought it. But it does not chop the herbs as fine as a food processor. If you try to mix small amount of herb and olive oil, most of them ended up hanging on the sidewall after it starts, so the mixture cannot be chopped anymore. Maybe for bigger batch of herb, it will be more useful. But for the fresh herbs for two-people dinner, I actually have to use a bigger food processor.\n\nOverall, it is a nice piece. I like the look and feel of it, and the price is reasonable even I only use it for grinding coffee beans. If you want to grind herbs though, you might want to look for another product."

Perhaps that is standard with coffee grinders in this price range, because we do that with our other coffee grinder too. Contrary to another review I read, I have not had any trouble cleaning the grinder after use. I have ground pepper, coriander, cumin seed, and cardamom (the cardamom seeds were even a bit sticky because I removed them from their pods by hand). After use, I just wipe out the container with a wet paper towel. The blade is sharp and can't (as far as I know) be removed, so I have to work around it carefully. Grind longer, maybe even a whole minute, for a finer grind.\n\nThis is a great investment and it has made my foray into Indian cooking a lot easier. Oh, the cord is 28 inches, which is an issue in my kitchen (too short to reach the inconveniently placed outlet). However, it's so light and uncomplicated that I just take it to whatever free outlet I can find."

            "reviewText": "I actually have owned this grinder for a few years. It grinds spices very well. The blade is super sharp and creates a very fine grind. When it comes to using it for coffee, it lacks a bit. We use a french press style coffee maker and need our grind to be coarse and even. When using this grinder, we have to use quick pulses and shake the grinder to encourage even distribution of the coffee beans. It's very easy to over grind in this grinder, which creates a very fine grind and not ideal for a french press. If you're using a traditional style coffee pot with a filter, this wouldn't be such an issue because the filter will catch most of the sediment created by the finer grind. One issue we've always had with this grinder is the general mess it creates. The grinds stick to the lid. So once the lid is removed they tend to fall out onto the counter. Overall it's a very reliable grinder. The entire thing is very easy to clean with a quick rinse under the faucet or wipe down with a damp towel. I wouldn't hesitate to buy it again if I needed a very simple, easy to use grinder."

He brewed using a cheap 5 cup Mr. Coffee and an ancient grinder (literally over a decade old). But his coffee always tasted great. He always attributed it to one variable; freshly ground beans. He explained to me that coffee does expire (something I would never having guessed growing up with my parents using the same Folgers tin for a month). It doesnt go bad, but loses all its flavors. He also showed me how much cheaper whole beans are. So with this, I decided to buy my own grinder for when I moved out. This KRUPS model fit the bill perfectly. Relatively cheap, solid brand, perfect size, and ease of use.\n\nCouldnt be more happy. It does one job. But it does it extremely well. There are no variable speeds or grind settings as on more expensive models. But you really dont need them. If you want a finer grind, you simply leave it on longer. Too easy. It feels super sturdy and well built. Im guessing this unit will last a very long time.\n\nIt is also good looking. No reason to put it away as it lends a nice touch to any countertop.\n\nI bought this just for grinding coffee but Im sure the sky is the limit for its potential uses. Spices, nuts, it will all be no problem for the power of this little grinder.\n\nWould recommend to anybody looking for a great coffee grinder."

I use my grinder primarily for coffee, but on occasion have used it to grind spices (like nutmeg) as well. Unfortunately, since the compartment housing the beans isn't removable, cleaning the residual grounds can be a bit cumbersome... unless you like EVERYTHING to taste like coffee. Also, I noticed when grinding different coffee beans, if the grinder wasn't cleaned sufficiently, you can taste the old coffee beans and a slight burnt taste. The cleaning instructions tell you not to submerge the entire unit in water, but it's hard to get it the coffee oils out without really wetting the grinder. I've seen some machines with removable compartments for easier cleaning and I think that would have definitely been perfect for this. Aside from that, it's a great grinder and at a very reasonable price."

            "reviewText": "the Krups has a lot of nice features, but one nagging problem that makes it a pain to use- I have a French press, and it requires the grinds to be no smaller than a certain size- to get that ideal zone, you need to only tap the grind button two or three times- the problem is you get large unground beans as well, so to grind a bag of coffee, you put in a handful, grind it, set it aside, grind another handful, set it aside, etc.\n\nAfter you grind enough, you need to filter the results with a fork to scoop out the unground beans and regrind them. It makes a simple task take forever. If you don't do this, you risk overgrinding and ending up with grit in your french press.\n\nNow, the good news- it's designed to keep you from grinding off your finger, which is good because it's fast, sharp and powerful. Cleaning it is relatively easy- a damp paper towel along the inside is usually sufficient as long as you do it often. It's relatively small, so it's easy to store.\n\nDo those good features outweigh the uneven grinding? I'm not entirely convinced."

My only problem with this grinder is that once ground, the coffee tends to stick to the wall so that it take time to scape it out."

            "reviewText": "I work as a chef and we use coffee grinders frequently for grinding spices. Because there is no commercial-use version of a spice grinder (or at least not an affordable one), we are always burning through these standard coffee grinders. I have used many different ones and have seen many of them die after short, abusive lives. Professional kitchens are not kind to equipment of any kind. Things get beat up or neglected. And coffee/spice grinders are usually the most susceptible.\n\nHowever, this Krup grinder is one of the most hearty I have used. As long as the plastic lid/cup doesn't crack (I've only seen that happen once), this thing will last forever. It is durable, grinds spices to fine powder, and is reasonably easy to clean. There may be other coffee grinders out there with bells and whistles, or flashy designs, but if you just need something to grind your coffee (or spices) and isn't going to die in six months, this is it. Strongly recommended."

My previous Krups grinder lasted for over 10 years. Sometimes the simpler the better. This grinder does all that is required from a grinder and the price is so good that I keep two colors on hand, one for spices and another coffee, etc. that might flavor each other. Great product."

            "reviewText": "I have had this coffee grinder for just over 2 years, and it stopped working one day without an apparent reason - I wasn't grinding anything particularly hard, nothing got stuck, it just stopped. When I removed the coffee beans, the motor would engage and the blades would spin, but any time something was in the chamber, the motor would still come on, but the blades would not spin. I had my husband take it apart (it was conveniently just past warranty) because it appeared the motor was working fine, and he found that the gear that allows the blades to engage is just a small plastic piece that had been stripped. For another 15 cents per device, this piece could have been made out of metal and would have probably lasted until the motor gave out. I am not a particularly frequent or abusive user of this grinder, so I am pretty disappointed in the longevity of the device given that both of my parents both have similar coffee grinders that have lasted for 10+ years. I imagine that's just part of the plan for more sales/they just make everything out of plastic now. *sigh*\nPrior to it breaking, it functioned fine. It's more of a dust and boulders situation than a consistent grind, but for those of us that just want a cup of coffee, it's perfectly fine. I like that it's compact. It was pretty loud, but I think that's standard."

No difference in flow for my espresso machine.

Otherwise some of the grounds will spill out.\nI miss my old Braun grinder that died after nearly 20 years of use. It was made more sensibly with a very thin cap that prevented grounds from spilling out."

I didn't want to take a chance. Not so with this one. I think its because of the high 200W motor. It really shoots the flax around thoroughly grinding to a meal and is controlled by short bursts that I execute with the top switch.Very pleased. I would give it a 5 if it weren't for the fact that its mostly plastic. Even the stainless well is not very high and doesn't reach the top or the mill. I wish manufacturers would reduce plastic exposure. It is well made and this is probably why it ranks as an Amazon Best Seller."

Other than an increase in watts & a color change to black, this grinder is the same exact one that I grew up with. It grinds nice & even every time in a matter of seconds. The increase in power makes me wonder whether this one will last as long as my previous one, but even if it only lasts half the time it will still have been well worth it. I hope they never change or stop selling this classic.\n\nCons: 1) It's loud, but you only have to listen for a couple seconds. 2) It grinds pretty fine.

Simple but effective design, extremely well built. As others posted, to adjust the fineness of grind, just pulse and/or shake it as you grind, and after a bit of time you will learn to how much time it takes and the sound it makes to get the right grind. I use a gold conical filter and rarely if ever have a problem with the coffee pot getting fine silt at the bottom, and I brew really dark coffee. It's also advisable to use a small brush every few times to clean the grinds that build up inside the lid and around the grinder bowl. This is true of any grinder. Also used with mediocre quality espresso machine and found it adequate, but if you spend $$$+ on an espresso maker and have the skills and/or desire to pull barista quality espresso shots, might as well spend another $250+ on a decent burr grinder."

As for coffee beans, he used to pulverize them at the crack of dawn with the bottom of his wing-tipped heals, which date back to the Han Dynasty.\n\nThe problem with this heal-slamming of beans into grounds was that Uncle Hubie would have to begin at 4 in the morning. Sometimes he would not finish until \"The Price is Right\" would come on. How can we possibly watch a skinny Drew Carey without not so much as single cup of coffee in our digestive systems?\n\nLenora and I had to put our foot down. Not on the beans, but on our Uncle's rigid and unyielding grip on all things dogmatic and Nixonian. He still insists on Miracle Whip for God's sake! So we sat him down and told him about your Krups coffee and spice grinder. He hemmed and hawed but after playing a few rounds of Russian Roulette with the egg-beaters, he came around.\n\nWell, let me tell you! Uncle Hubie now sleeps well past six. In less than a minute, the grounds are pulverized and ready. He frolics about with the Krups device like Carmen Miranda. He has pulverized cinnamon sticks, aspirin, and Legos as well.\n\nThank you for this liberating device. We are looking forward to the cha-cha sounds each day. Hubie plans to shred some dill weed soon, as we are expecting company. I might even give a go at pulverizing my Kaluha-spiced pumpkin seeds. It shall be done in lickety-split time.\n\nWe no longer watch M.A.S.H."

See photo. I only fill to the top of the metal line and I hold the button down (not pulsing). The problem is the grinds come out ranging from the desired small size I want up to whole bean size when I hold for six or seven seconds. It is so bad and so much coffee is being wasted that I now use a colander as a sifter. What falls out into the bowl is perfect for my French press then I have to re-grind the large pieces to get the right size. If hold it for more than seven seconds it can bring some of it down to complete powder while the other pieces are all different too-large sizes. I have also tried various ways of pulsing and none of it works.\n\nMy husband once purchased me a coffee bean grinder that was three times the cost of this one which she saw recommended by Alton Brown but that didn't work either. I am still trying to find a coffee bean grinder they can actually grind a decent coffee bean. My husband once purchased me a coffee bean grinder that was three times the cost of this one which she saw recommended by Alton Brown but that didn't work either.

But sometimes we forget to do that and I want to grind the beans at home and I need a new coffee bean grinder! Any suggestions?"

            "reviewText": "I have never felt the need to write a review for any product I have ordered on Amazon.\n\nHowever, I felt it was important that I post my experience with this Krups Coffee Maker, so as to save someone the time and money in trying this product.\n\nThe problems started IMMEDIATELY when I was following the instructions to clean the coffee maker. I filled the reservoir with water & loaded the pot on the warmer. I pushed the grind off button & it beeped, but nothing happened. (No water pumped) The instructions say the LED screen should show a flashing coffee cup and it was not there. I then gave up on being able to use that button on the machine and attempted to use whole beans to see if the machine functioned at all.\n\nI was happy to see that when I selected the number of cups, strength of coffee, and coarseness of the grind the machine started to make coffee after pressing \"Grind | Brew\". The coffee brewed quickly and tasted great. I was happy to keep trying the machine even if I wasn't able to brew using the ground coffee option. (I had bought this for whole beans anyways). I went to bed after setting the auto-start function for 6 cups with whole beans for the next morning.\n\nI woke up to the sound of the machine grinding down the hallway. The machine isn't extremely loud, but in my small apartment i was able to hear it while sleeping. This is not an issue and I actually liked hearing it knowing I would be having some hot coffee in 10 minutes when my alarm goes off.\n\nI grab my 6 cups of freshly made hot coffee and pour a mug and put the rest back on the heater. The coffee again tasted great, and I finish my morning routine. After loading my travel cup with the remaining coffee I attempt to turn the heater off. Nothing works. I follow the instructions, and nothing works. The troubleshooting section is a joke. I am unable to press any of the buttons on the machine to make anything change on the LCD screen. It still blinks with the coffee mug (indicating heating) instead of turning off. I decide to unplug the machine like the troubleshooting section suggests. When I plugged it back, again nothing happened on the LCD screen. Again, none of the buttons did anything. I could hear a very faint buzzing noise within the machine. After several attempts of plugging the machine in to no avail I decided to give up on this machine.\n\nThe whole idea that this machine would allow me to use whole beans, and have freshly ground hot coffee at a set time when I wake up was what sold me on this product. There are plenty of comments like mine where the machine is great in theory, but in reality it is poorly made and does not function. I am returning this item tomorrow and will continue looking for a new coffeemaker. I am sad that this one did not work and has shown in its very short time with me several catastrophic issues. I REALLY wanted to like this machine.\n\nUnfortunately, this item is a 1/5 for me and I strongly recommend AGAINST buying this.\n\nI should have taken a look at the amount of 1 star reviews before making the plunge, and you should too. Don't just take my word for it."

I was using this for my BBQ spices (peppercorns, etc) and it worked great. My wife washed it out to use it for other ingredients and the internals must have rusted. The motor sounds like it is trying to spin, but the blade is just siezed. I can hardly rotate it by hand. I tried PB blaster, WD-40, etc. No avail.\n\nKitchen item should not fail this easily. I'm not sure if I just had a defective unit (bad seal somewhere or something). It is unfortunate because it worked great when it worked. I just opened the unit up and can't easily access the blade. Will have to find a new grinder.\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW\nI use this thing to ground up spices for my BBQ recipes. All of the recipes call for 'finely ground kosher salt'.... and 'finely ground bacon bits' - well guess what? You can't just buy those things. I bought this and it works perfectly. It turns kosher salt into powder in about 5 seconds. I tried doing the same in my food processor to no avail.\n\nThe best part? This grinder is SMALL - it can just get tucked away in the back of a cabinet. It is perfect if you are only looking for something to use once every few weeks."

Ok, I've been using this for a couple of weeks now and I've experimented with different volumes, grind times (by stop watch), and it is just terrible. How in the world it was ever release to market is beyond me. Even when grinding for only 6 or 7 seconds, the fines pack up at the oblong end of the grinder-across from the switch. It is useless for anything other than espresso. Krups should be ashamed of themselves for selling this piece of crap. I'll grant that it is well made, but the DESIGN is terrible.

I replaced it with this model and so far so good.\n\nThe weakness of these grinders is inability to get consistently ground coffee. Since there is no timer but a button to pulse and grind. You do eventually get a feel for pulsing for a few seconds. I shake my grinder for a few seconds to try to make the ground coffee as uniform as possible. Any more than 4 seconds and the beans go right through my re-usuable gold mesh filter.\n\nI would recommend for simple coffee grinding. I have yet to try and grind pepper or other spices."

That unit is gone now, but I had no idea how good I had it before. :(\n\nI bought this unit in hopes that it would perform on par with the old unit, and probably outlast it. Thus far, this unit's performance is sub-par, the lack of a removable grind cup (cited in another review) is a much larger issue than I anticipated, and the consistency of the grind isn't as good as the other unit.\n\nI understand this isn't a burr grinder, but I wouldn't recommend this unit if you're making, say, Moka pot coffee.\n\nUPDATE: If I crank on this for a six-to-eight second spin, yes, I can get a consistent and fine grind. BUT I'm probably going to end up using a dollar-store toothbrush to clean out the hopper, as I suspect using this for that long with old coffee grounds at the bottom of the hopper is a recipe for burnt-tasting coffee when old and new grounds intermingle. So, for me, the final verdict remains unchanged: it seems a fine grinder, but it is way too messy to be above about first third in the pack."

The longer you hold or pulse the grind button the finer things get until you have powder. The reason I'm taking one star off is that after 5-10 seconds of continuous grinding, or 20 seconds of pulsed grinding I smell burning lubricant from the motor of this device. I think it should have had a better way to ventilate it to keep the motor cool than just putting some holes on the bottom. I can prevent a lot of the burning smell if I blow into the vent holes to cool the engine while it's grinding, and this is why the motor itself should be pushing vent air. I can't be sure this effects the longevity of the product since I only recently started using it, but I know it doesn't help the smell of my kitchen when it's in use. Otherwise, it's a great grinder for the price and I recommend it over some other models that are much more expensive that do the same thing."

Coffee has traditionally been grown in a shady forest environment, but new mass-marketed sun-grown coffee plantations (Dunkin, Starbucks) are rapidly decimating the winter migration habitats of our songbirds. They clear the forests in order to grow more coffee faster. Birds flying to South America will not survive without their ancestral forests, and whole species are endangered. Birds can, however, thrive in the shade-grown coffee farms that supply certified bird-friendly coffee.\nThe grinder works well. Put down a dishtowel for easier cleanup: the transfer of grounds into a storage container can be messy. Use a small brush to move caked grounds from the grinder cup.\nYou can find ground bird-friendly coffee online: Audubon bird-friendly coffee\u00a0Audubon Breakfast Blend Ground, 12-Ounce (Pack of 2)"

I tried using a blush so the bristles can clean under the blades but it doesn't seem to help.\n\nThis might be due to grinding things other than coffee beans such as chia seeds. I think a blade removal guide or procedure could help to clean it better and prevent build up under the blades. This is the second KRUPS grinder that has broken this way and it has been frustrating to find a fix."

The basket does not detach from the grinder to dump contents so you have to pick up the whole grinder to get out your coffee grinds and to clean it. I was planning on using this as my spice grinder also, which it does really well, but I have to unplug it and handle the whole thing to get my spices over to my cookware. It's awkward and annoying. I don't understand why the basket doesn't detach from the body. I just don't understand it. Seems like simple design to me."

Cleaning is sometimes a hassle as there is little space between the blade and the bottom of the grinding bowl, but I don't think that there's any real away around it.\n\nWe use ours everyday for the last month or so, and have no real complaints."

Like most grinders it leaves some grind residue in the bottom but that's to be expected. The lid attracts very little grinds.\n\nThe only feature missing with the Krups is the wrap around cord storage which I had in the base of the Braun."

The best thing about this, was I didn't have to go out and buy it somewhere - it was just shipped. I'm lazy.\nIt grinds coffee very well, smoother than other ones five times as much....so if you want a great grinder, buy this one. However, if you want a CLEAN counter top, buy something else. Once you have mixed your beans/whatever up, there really is no great way to transfer without making a mess, or at least some spillage.

And it's perfect for small batches that get lost in a blender. For some reason I can't bring myself to switch from my favorite pre-ground coffee to try whole bean in this grinder, but I've used it to grind black pepper and cumin seeds, and it works well. It gives off that familiar burning oil smell when it runs, which is true of most small kitchen appliances and, I'm sure, will diminish with time. This little unit is powerful, looks and sounds like it should last a long time."

To clean, I usually throw the top in the dishwasher or hand wash. For the bowl of the grinder, I either pulse a few torn up pieces of stale bread or raw rice. The breadcrumbs or rice clean up all of the remaining spices, oils and odors and it's back to being good as new. If you love to cook and grind your own spices, this is the best spice grinder out there and an amazing value for your money."

I keep reading about the \"numbing\" sensation that Szechuan peppercorns provide and have been very interested. I scoured the Asian markets near me (which in Toledo is not that many) and have bought them from three different places. All of them had a bit of a mild lemongrass flavor when chewed on but no discernable heat or numbing. I thought that maybe I just didn't have the capacity to perceive that quality to them.\n\nUntil I ordered these guys, that is. Not really think making about the ramifications of chewing on a single peppercorn, I tried one (just one small piece, really!) and holy bejebus, these peppercorns are the real deal. It still has a mild lemongrass taste but imagine that amplified by someone holding a 9v battery to your tongue...even after brushing your teeth and rinsing with Listerine.\n\nThese things are the real deal and intense in both flavor and red color. The ones I bought locally were all nearly brown, nothing like these. There may be other equally good or maybe better brands than these, but not that I have tried. If you are looking into trying Szechuan cuisine,you owe it to yourself to try these!"

You probably should experiment to determine the best grind for your needs, but in my experience the normal among us isn't going to notice much difference in a few seconds more or less, unless you're dripping water through a one-cup cone filter (in which case, a slightly coarser grind might be better).

But all those 5 stars can't be loving coffee powder all over the counter. I tried different ways of getting the coffee out without making a mess and the simplest was the bes--just pull the lid straight up and poor the grinds into the filter. I scrape the coffee stuck in the bowl up and poor that out. Last is I run the spoon around the top of the bowl and knock the loose powder into the bowl (the metal bottom.) There is very faint coffee dust stuck to the outside of the top where it inserts into the machine base, but that is not even worth wiping.\n\nThis thing is very fast. Finely ground coffee in less than a minute. I used to get soooo bored holding down the grind button on previous grinders. Grinding beans is now not a lifetime commitment and I am out of the kitchen.\n\nI grind about 9 cups worth of coffee at a time. In the picture you can see beans at the top of the plastic cover. I don't see any way you could do that without turning it over and using the lid as a cup. This would only work if you are doing very course grind for percolators. I would not even try that for any fine grind, then it would be a problem."

I don't use it to grind spices, so I can't comment on that. I did notice on my old grinder that the oils had a tendency to discolor. I have had this one for almost 3 weeks and it still looks new. If you're using it for coffee, from mild to Turkish, you won't be disappointed."

If you continue to leave the grinder button on it will start to create a layer of wet grounds around the inside of the grinder, but I would assume that this would be the case for any grinder because of the revolutions. Not a big problem for me. I tend to pulse the grinder through my grinding periodand shake the canister a bit. Then you can turn the grinder upside down and tap the top of the grinder on the counter to release and stuck grounds. Great buy and would recommend."

            "reviewText": "This is the same coffee grinder my mom had 20+ years ago and I knew I wanted one of my own. If you're still on the fence, here's why I am a fan:\n- You can grind it as course as you want: easy to control the size\n- Super easy to use, easy to clean\n- The volume of the grinder is just right: I usually fill it up with whole coffee beans and once I grind them I have as much as I want to brew 12 cups\n- Can be used for spices, nuts and other things you want to grind up quickly\n\nThe only downside is that it once you grind your beans and lift the lid you might notice it spilling over the top and making a mess. I've perfected this process; here's my recommendation: once you finish grinding your beans, unplug the grinder and tip it upside down. Gently lift the base/machine with the lid on the bottom - this should avoid messes and make it easy to transfer your grinds into your filter/coffee maker.\n\nI still have a $20 Mr. Coffee from 4 years ago but my coffee tastes a lot better because I'm grinding my own whole bean coffee using this!"

Unless you are going to step up to a burr grinder, this is as good as I have experienced with a blade style grinder. The unit, like all blade grinders, does not produce a completely uniform grind. Its oval shape though, helps the beans to grind better than in units that are perfectly round and just tend to spin the beans without actually grinding them. There will be some trial and error involved in learning how to grind to your individual specifications, but the best solution is to be consistent with the amount of beans and learn how many pulses you prefer. The oval shape also makes pouring the ground beans into a french press easy and mess free."

(Note: some of the 5-star reviews on Amazon are for grinders that people have had for years; not for this newer version.) We got the new grinder yesterday and tried it once. The grind is completely uneven--some fine powder and some large chunks--and the motor makes a terrible\nhigh-pitched screech. The new grinder, made in China, weighs 22.20 oz; the old one, made in Hong Kong, weighs 22.75. It seems that Krups has chosen to skimp on the product components at the expense of (at least this customer's) confidence in their brand.\n\nThe old grinder's button got inexplicably stuck in the ON position, so it grinds away when it's plugged in, even with the lid off. I called Krups customer service to find out what to do about it, and they'd never heard of that problem. I was going to return the old grinder to them so that they could figure out the problem for the benefit of other customers. Now I think I'll keep it and try to fix it myself."

At the time the coffee maker had very few reviews but all of them were good. Just before Christmas I returned to Amazon to look again at reviews and was so disappointed to see many people complaining about theirs not working correctly. I fully prepared myself to not like the coffee maker. I'm happy to say that my husband is completely blown away by the quality of coffee that comes out of this thing. Never having ground our own coffee before we're not sure if that's the main factor or if it's the maker itself. But either way he's beyond pleased. My only complaint like others have stated is that the machine in the grind phase is LOUD. Crazy loud. Much louder than a small hand grinder is. But I've been surprised to find that despite my husband getting up early to make his coffee the grinding isn't waking up myself or our toddler.\n\nMy biggest concern now is the longevity of the machine. I hope it lasts long term and that we're not dealing with a broken machine a few months from now."

We usually wipe the inside clean with a damp paper towel after each use. You'll also want to be cautious when opening the product and when pouring the ground coffee out. When you open it, if you aren't too careful, sometimes some finely ground coffee will spill out. As long as you are cautious, this is entirely avoidable. Also, you have to watch that you don't clog the sensor with coffee grounds, otherwise some reviewers have said it may stop working. If you do manage to clog the sensor, it's an easy fix. Just blow it clean with either an air compressor or with the canned air you can get in most electronics sections at stores. It's the canned air used to clean computers and other fine electronics. Just blast a few gentle puffs of air into the sensor to blow out any coffee grounds that may be blocking it. Again, for the price this is a wonderful product and we truly love it. I definitely recommend this item!"

I'm not sure if I would buy another one, if I do I will go to the store and get it myself.

She is very happy with it, as we have always been, and now wants another one so she can have one for sweet spices and one for savory. We use the Krups for our sweet spices and it handles cinnamon sticks very well. I crush them in half with pliers so that they fit in the grinder. Store-bought ground cinnamon just doesn't hold a candle to freshly ground cinnamon sticks. I used my Krups last night to grind the spices for a curry dish: cinnamon, cardamom pods, fennel seeds, coriander seeds, ginger root; it handles them all without any problems. (Cayenne, cumin seeds, and turmeric in a different grinder.) The Krups is well worth the price for the culinary rewards you get. I can't imagine ever going back to buying ground spices."

The base where the coffee is ground is not removeable so you have to scoop out your coffee grounds from around the blade. Since you can\u2019t remove the blade/base you also have to run the entire assembly under water to clean it. As a result, there is definitely water getting under the base into where the motor is located. So far it still works after three washes so hopefully there are good seals underneath. Not sure why this is a best seller. Low price tag maybe? You can find something better."

I roast my own green beans, and not everyone uses a French Press.....so I roast and grind using the Krups for friends' drip coffee makers.\n\nI also grow and dry my own chile peppers, and one of my krups is devoted ONLY for grinding dried chiles.\n\nThis is an excellent, all-around grinder!\n\nbill"

While it blends exceeding well for a normal brew, it does not get fine enough for espresso. Also if you rinse the inside out be sure to let it dry upside down as water can seep down below the blade housing and get your next grind wet if you don't dry it out fully. Neither of these is a negative and doesn't take away from the product at all."

Freshly toasted and ground spices really taste so much better than the bland, pre-ground stuff. Just be sure to shake the grinder as you go, give it plenty of time and don't add anything wet. It's a bargain compared to a dedicated spice grinder and works just as well for dry stuff."

I have used about 6-7 different brands of lesser grinders for spices that I have never seen live past 6 months. in addition to not lasting very long, these other grinders do not grind very well (often resulting in overheating and a lessened life of the grinder). the krups grinder is efficient, often times getting about a 1/2 cup of spices ground fairly fine in a few seconds. I've never seen a grinder work this well, and I would highly recommend this product to anyone who wants a great grinder at a very reasonable price."

I bought the Krups based on a recommendation from Cooks Illustrated. The Krups works well, is very easy to clean, and much quieter than the NutriBullet. My only complaint is the limited capacity of the Krups compared to the NB. In a single batch, I can just barely grind enough beans (about 60 gm) for our 40 oz. pot. Of course, you can grind multiple batches for larger pots when needed. A word of advice about using this style of grinder -- to get a uniform grind, grind in short pulses rather than continuously. Visually check the grind after each pulse through the clear top. I've found that this method assures a precise and uniform grind, with minimal coffee dust."

Remove top (one hand) put a quantity of beans in the grinder, replace top, push down for as long as you wish - the longer the finer the grind \"surprise surprise\".\n\nFrench Press maybe 5-10 seconds, Espresso maybe 30 or so.\n\nThe resulting grinds are very even, despite the complaints from the \"experts\"\n\nThink about it anyway, even IF the grinds aren't perfectly ground - does it change the taste of your coffee?\nNo!\n\nOk to be fair I will find ONE \"con\" - you will need to find an implement to loosen the grinds that get stuck under the blade! That is all.\n\nThis is the perfect all round grinder, for a fraction of the price of one of those \"fancy\" grinders!\n\nWe have 2, one for coffee and one for spices, that way no worries about cleaning completely.\n\nI highly recommend this to others, thanks for reading."

Unfortunately, this grinder does not include a settings control, so if you want your coffee (or spices) ground \"coarse\" instead of \"fine,\" you need to \"time\" how long you grind it. Really?? Many cheaper, and just as well made, coffee grinders include this important feature. Shame on you, Amazon, for including this as a \"combo\" purchase with a product that requires a specific type of coffee ground (coarse vs fine). At least I was able to get this returned for a refund, but now I have to go out and buy a grinder so I can try out the coffeemaker I just received."

            "reviewText": "This product has so many reviews that it hardly needs me to add my hosannas; nevertheless, here I am. This is my third or fourth Krups grinder in about a billion years and only one replacement was actually due to deterioration. I have one grinder for coffee and one for spices. It is a simple machine and has always worked for me whether grinding for espresso, drip, French press, or even Arabic/Turkish/Greek (if I missed anyone, I apologize). My secret for happy use is to pulse rather than just grind away. I also stop occasionally and gently shake the grinder (holding down the lid, of course) to help achieve a more consistent result. This adds very little time to the operation. I don't clean the coffee grinder after every use, but a slightly damp paper towel followed by a dry one has always worked well for me. Like another reviewer here, I usually grind up a piece of bread in the Krups I use for spices--it not only leaves the machine clean, but absorbs the scents of aromatic spices. Really, why spend more if you, like me, are a simple soul who doesn't need or want too many furbelows for a cup of coffee or a little ground coriander?"

I used it to grind ginseng (or chop as one of the reviewer indicated). On the first try, it was all good, powerful little machine ground well with the cup full of ginseng. On the second try. it was not so great. Like many reviewers pointed out, it kept humming and not working. But only the second use for a new machine made it really look bad. I then tried to use it differently until I found out it was humming because the blade was stuck. I had to remove the stuck ginseng and move it above the blade and then it started to grind. In summary, this product works fine if you put in small amount of \"payload\" and not get stuck. When it got stuck, stop the machine immediately. Keep the motor running while it is stuck can harm the machine. I have not ground any coffee so I can't say much of it but I would do the same:\n\n1. Not to put too much in. Know its limit.\n2. Remove the stuck from under the blade and try again.\n\nHopefully, it will then last a long time as many folks have had it."

It saved me money, and always gave me fresh ground spices. I always start by toasting my spices in a small cast iron pan over medium-low heat, remove from heat when I smell the spices, put in grinder and grind it. Never fail. Another advantage with this small grinder is its small footprint. So small, fits in my crowded cabinet well. After seven years of use, it basically paid itself. It's a good equipment for a new college graduate's first kitchen, also a very useful tool for my over equipped gourmet kitchen."

It's very quiet for what it does (though that does not mean that it's literally quiet) and even though it puts off some noise in an absolute sense, it's over quickly because it grinds so fast. Highly recommended."

Braun was great and held for many years doing that while the Krups was doing a comparable job for 2 years. After the Braun and before buying the Krups I tried several other coffee grinders - all broke at first trial.\n\nThe Krups 2 years lifespan grinding hard and rough cinnamon bark to a fine powder at ~$17 is the reason I just ordered it again. Braun no longer makes small coffee grinder perhaps because there are many chippos that grind coffee well. But it seems that someone still sells them (perhaps some leftover stock) for a whopping price of ~$142 (I bought mine for ~$42). Hence my 4 stars!"

            "reviewText": "I bought this grinder to replace a Hamilton Beach 80365 model that had dropped on the ground and was not functioning. I didn't think there was much of a difference between coffee grinders, and reading all the rave reviews on this one, I went with the grinder that was a few bucks cheaper. The Krups grinder works as advertised and I don't have any complaints about its grinding capabilities. It makes quick work of coffee beans and you can grind as long as you like by holding down the grinding button. I have not had to use it for grinding spices yet but don't see why this won't work well too.\n\nThe downside to this grinder is that I find it leaves behind a lot of coffee grounds when I am done grinding. So there is always an extra task of cleaning up the grounds after grinding. A minor inconvenience, but kind of annoying since the Hamilton Beach grinder was less messy. The Krups also did not come with a brush to brush off the grounds that get stuck to the grinder, I am using the Hamilton Beach grinder's leftover brush for this purpose.\nFinally, the Krups only has one grinding setting. Other grinders I have seen can grind finer to coarser depending on the setting that you pick (The Hamilton Beach used to have this feature). Again, a minor inconvenience but if you're ever looking to make drip coffee AND/OR expresso and need to finely grind your beans, I'm not sure this Krups grinder can get them fine enough.\n\nThe Krups is a good grinder overall and it works as advertised, but I would choose the Hamilton Beach grinder over this one next time."

The Krups works perfectly. It grinds to a very fine powder, and does it very quickly. The powder is contained in the grinder - none escapes to float around the kitchen. It is simple to operate, and the top removes easily when you are done. (On one grinder that I tried it was next to impossible to remove the top because the fine powder got between the base and the lid, as well as managing to leak out, leaving a fine powder floating throughout the kitchen.) I am very happy with the Krups, and it sure beats trying to grind all those pills by hand."

Super easy to clean and doesn't take up hardly any space in my cupboard."

The retail box simply says Krups F203 Grinder. That is what it is called.\n\nIn the details, it mentions that it is intended for use with coffee AND spices.\n\nHope that clears it up for anyone who is confused as to what this grinder is meant to be used for.\n\nFor dry spices and for coffee, it is fantastic. Produces a very nice and even grind. Does seem like it will need slightly more thorough cleaning after using certain spices, but that is to be expected."

It's quick and easy to over process so use short bursts. Six short bursts for French Press. A little longer steady for drip. Not good for espresso, but good enough for Greek and baking.\nJust count me in with the others."

To clean the grinder I bought a tint brush for under a dollar at a beauty store and that does the job just fine. If you make coffee just to get through the morning, this will work great."

Everyone was recommending this grinder over even the really expensive ones. Well I bought it, and I'm now a believer. This thing is as good as everyone has been raving about.\n\nBTW, don't listen to the \"fine grind only\" yahoos. You can pulse grind with this, so you can make your grinds as coarse or fine as you like. I use it exclusively for my french press, and is works perfectly. I like a coarser grind for that, and sometimes let those half cracked beans fall in there too.\n\nBuy it, and look back only to spread the love and leave a review!"

However, you can't wash anything other than the cap. So maybe this would be fine for a coffee lover, but if you're grinding cumin you're going to have a hard time not getting cumin in whatever you grind next. My cap has also cracked, but since it's been working fine cracked for six months that's more of a \"by the time it breaks I'll probably feel like I got my money's worth\". So it's functional, but you'll probably going to be annoyed and have mixed up tasting spices. Personally, I'm going to be gifting myself with a new grinder soon and it will be something different.\n\nUpdate:\nI don't know why I haven't bought a new one sooner, but I noticed corrosion on the inside on what I thought was the stainless steel cup so it's in the garbage and I'm shopping for a new one. On the bright side, it did last 3 years."

This is why others have complained about the sludge in their coffee. The obvious solution would have been to make the reservoir ROUND, not OVAL. You end up having to use a brush to get out the ultrafine coffee trapped in the ends of the well. Truly idiotic, especially for a company like Krups, which traditionally made such beautiful products. So, I'm looking for another new one now. At least it wasn't horribly expensive, but still....."

You can't clean it using water, but it's really easy to clean - just wipe away with a paper towel after each use. Or if you insist of using soap, just use a small amount with paper towel and clean out just the inside. I wouldn't get the exterior wet though. I've had this for a couple months now, so this review is much deserved. The speed is really fantastic, I feel like it's high quality grade - something they might use in a small coffee shop. Love it!

The grinder is a bit noisy but I took it as an added benefit to wake up ;-) Unfortunately it seems very difficult to get a replacement carafe... Yes, mine broke after 2 weeks (my mistake or my cat's). The KRUPS website was not helpful at all so I called them up and was directed to a company called \"Small Appliances\". They were friendly and promised me the replacement carafe within 5 to 10 days. After 14 days there was nothing. I called them back and was told that the part is temporarily out of stock but would be back in January. No call, no email. Not a very happy camper."

It might be my imagination but I like the coffee I hand grind in a ceramic (conical?) burr grinder which crushes the bean into dust rather than slices to dust. It may just be the workout I get by hand while waiting for the water to boil that makes it seem better.\n\nEither way, blade or ceramic crush, this grinder (blade) will grind fast and be a good buy to get your coffee ground."

Also the white was turning yellow, the cord was getting stiff and the wife was getting cranky about it junking up our counter. Since she used it as much as I did I got her the new one for xmas - let her junk up the counter."

I'm getting it repaired now.\n\nThe replacement I bought, the 203-42, is not as good. The plastic is flimsier. The motor whines at a more irritating pitch, but is less powerful. The cord is shorter... inconveniently so. And the smell? Every time I use the grinder, the smell of burning rubber/plastic overwhelms the aroma of my dark roasted beans. I seriously fear a meltdown.\n\nLet me say, the grinder does grinds the coffee beans. That IS the bottom line, isn't it? But it doesn't do it as easily, as pleasantly, or as conveniently as the original model for which I so patiently wait to return from the shop."

I used to have a giant burr grinder, but I was unhappy with how much space it took up and beans were always getting clogged. When the grinder gets a little messy I use an espresso brush to clean out excess grounds (this eliminates the coffee's oil residue that giving you stale tasting coffee). All you do is press down the button for as course or fine of a grind as you're hoping for - super easy! Be sure to unplug the unit before emptying your coffee - you don't want any blade accidents! I'm going to buy a separate one for spices - terrific purchase! Pictured with an average sized coffee bag for scale.\nIf you found my review helpful, please click Yes below! :)"

The lid is very stiff to come out and even to put back in. The bottom (as on picture) part of the lid - the one that goes inside the grinder - serves like a cup, but a cup with its outer side rubbing against the grinder's inner wall, which is always covered with coffee. Effectively the \"inner\" (as viewed vertically) side of the cup (the one that touches the grinder's inner side) becomes the cup's OUTER side when you pull it out, covered with coffee particles that rub against the grinder's inner wall and make it very hard to both pull it out and put back in due to excessive friction, not to mention that having a cup that has its OUTER side covered with coffee just plain makes no sense. The \"ingenious\" (due to its simplicity - no hinges) design is bad - if you pull too hard, and you have to - due to friction of the coffee particles - the particles just get spread all over the place. 100% bad design, stay away."

This particular grinder is easy to clean and has a single button (not much can go wrong there). The only issue is adjusting grind-size, which you cant; I achieve rougher grinds by short bursts accompanied by shaking of the beans while grinding.\n\nAll-in-all I loved this so much that I now own two."

Otherwise, it's too fine. Like all blade grinders, the size of the particles is not uniform until the spices or coffee are ground to a fine powder. Trying for a coarser grind, say for a French press, leaves a lot to be desired. I've also tried this on caraway seeds and cumin seed. For anything less than a full tablespoon, the grinding blade won't even touch the spice seed, and even then does not produce a uniform result."

I use it as a spice grinder, in which capacity it works wonderfully. Home made garam masala is a cinch with this grinder that performs well and quickly. Everything from stick-cinnamon to cumin is pulverized (literally) by this efficient grinder.\n\nMy only nits to pick are these: it doesn't perform quite as well when you are only grinding, say, 1 tsp. of anything (it seems to need a little more in order to force stuff down into the blade; a Tbsp. always does well); and the clear cap which, I suppose, is to allow easy viewing of the ground material, couds with use. I don't know if it's from the oils in the spices or the abrasion of the little bits flying around all the time.\n\nSuper pros: great motor, durable parts. I had one for the better part of 5 years before I had to replace it (which I did with another of the same model). The blade is the only one I've seen that is angled up on one end and down on the other, allowing better agitation of material that has settled toward the sides. The Cuisinart and the Mr. Coffee both have blades that angle up at both ends, and I can't see how these would be able to reach down and convince the coriander seeds in the bottom of the grinder to come up and get powdered.\n\nIf you want a coffee ginder, I don't know how well this will do. But for a spice grinder this is an excellent choice."

Sadly, the grinder only lasted us 7 months. We can hear the motor trying to move, but it's just stuck. We tried cleaning it and to no avail, the blades don't move anymore. We thought some coffee grinds ended up getting stuck in it. I loved that thing when we had it. Even though the price is super affordable, we decided not to repurchase this item and get a hand crank instead."
