            "reviewDate": "October 5, 2017",
            "reviewText": "About 4 months ago, my wife bought us an espresso maker for our anniversary. After seeing prices upwards of $100 for every electric burr grinder out there, we decided to go with this little guy instead. Now, after having two of these grinders and making espressos every day (no that is not a joke, and yes, we like our coffee), there are four big takeaways:\n\n0) First off, this thing grinds quite well, which it should since that's is sole job (but see #2). Espresso absolutely tastes noticeably different between this and an electric blade grinder. If you want espresso, you need a non-blade grinder of some sort, for certain.\n\n1) This device is ... SLOOOOOW ... at grinding espresso for two people. It is quite fast if you want a French press (takes us about a minute), but if you want grinds small enough for several shots of espresso, be prepared to elbow grease it for 5-10 minutes. While this is typically a non-issue (you simply grind while talking, or watching the news, etc.), we have days where 5-10 minute grind sessions are just not possible and others were it just seems like my time should be better spent elsewhere (like walking the dog, or helping my kids). If you are a rush out the door type of morning person or have large family commitments, heads up!\n\n1A) My friend has an electric grinder; he makes us espresso every time we go over. It takes about 5 minutes for four of us to have cups in hands. My family visited, and it was a solid 20 minutes before four of us had an espresso in hand. This is absolutely, without question, a personal use device only, at least for fine grounds.\n\n2) Customer service for this company is BEYOND PHENOMENAL. Our first grinder just seemed off, but being espresso newbs we weren't quite sure. After explaining how it was grinding, they instantly said \"nope, that's not supposed to happen\" and shipped us a new grinder express. It was quick, it was polite, it was easy. Great, great, great service.\n\n3) So the new grinder arrives, and as noted it grinds beautifully! The problem: the bottom half of the grinder (the storage container) slips off quite easily, as in, if you don't hang onto it while grinding it falls off. The fix was simple: just switch the bottom with our defective grinder. Regardless, my experience at this point, coupled with the thousands of reviews saying just how great their costumer service is, leads me to believe that the company does not have a great quality control unit and instead relies on great customer service. THAT IS FINE. If you're going to treat people like kings and queens when we contact you with defects, by all means, use that as your business model. This remains a buyer beware situation, but quite possibly the nicest one you will ever find yourself it.\n\nSo why 4 stars? Because after 4 months, I think the drawbacks are noticeable enough to call this a very good, but not great product. People need to be aware that you will spend a good chunk of time and energy grinding, and probably spend time and energy making sure your product is actually up to standard.\n\nBottom line: I would definitely recommend this, warts and all, based on the price and quality grinds. Just don't kid yourself about the warts."

In the meantime, here's a brief list of pros vs cons on this product!\n\nPros:\n-Works great for the Aeropress using a somewhat \"fine\" course setting with the conical burr just about touching the inside burrs\n-While it does take a full 1-2 minutes to grind an Aeropress scoop worth of beans, it requires very minimal effort\n-Built-in window is a nice add-on\n-Relatively easy to clean\n-Oddly enough, it fits perfectly into the hollow part of the Aeropress plunger for easy transportation\n\nCons:\n-This product is basically the same design as all the other hand grinders available on Amazon, with the same inherent design flaws\n-As with all hand grinders, the grind you get for your coffee is never 100% consistent\n-Plastic piece that sits inside the conical burr is very prone to breakage *****SEE BELOW*****\n\nOkay, now for the important part! While I cannot speak for the other companies that sell basically the same product, JavaPresse sets themselves apart for their PHENOMENAL customer service! The aforementioned plastic piece inside the conical burr on mine broke after only two months of multiple grinds per day usage. After contacting JavaPresse about my broken burr using their website, I received an email back from them in literally ten to fifteen minutes asking for my address to send me a whole replacement grinder. The person who responded also told me they were going to be releasing an upgraded burr with a nylon insert that would be available within the week.\n\nI responded with my address, thanked them for their prompt service and also asked them to alert me when the upgraded burr was available. In response not only did they send me a whole new grinder, but they had just received these upgraded burrs and sent them to me as well!!!! To say I was blown away by the immediate, prompt, and efficient response to my issues with this product is an understatement. Its not often you see or hear of customer service like this anymore!"

This was obviously a defect and I returned it for a full refund. I also sent the company feedback about my experience and I received a prompt response taking responsibility, apologizing, and offering to send me a replacement.\n\nI have been using this coffee grinder since then and I'm so pleased that I gave it another shot because it's fantastic and exactly what I was looking for. It easily separates into six parts for cleaning, which I do about once a week, and it's easy to put it back together. It took me only a couple minutes and about a dozen coffee beans to calibrate to the couresness I was looking for for a French press. I made note of how many threads are visible at that calibration so I don't have to recalibrate each time I disassemble it for cleaning.\n\nI really wanted to buy this because I was previously using a nutribullet with a milling attachment to grind my coffee beans each morning and it was loud, the couresness was really varied and not ideal for my coffee press, and it was a pain to clean everytime. This coffee grinder takes about ten seconds (yes, I timed it for you) to grind beans for one cup, it's very quiet, and I get uniform size for my coffee press.\n\nI would definitely recommend this coffee grinder."

It does need some elbow grease to grind the beans and it does take longer than the traditional blade or burr grinder - remember, it's manual, not electric. So far the grind seems consistent. Adjusting the grind takes some getting used to as you need to remember click count. The more clicks, the coarser the grind. I can't speak to the espresso grind requirement since I don't make it. I had to go online to learn recommended clicks for the type of grind as that info was not included in the little info flyer included. It talks about the grind size, using after the desired grind is selected, but does not provide the equivalent number of clicks. They have a lot of good information online. Having said that, here are their recommended starting points.... You're welcome.\n\nCoarse (13-18 Clicks) - French Press, Cold Brew, Percolator, Coffee Cupping\nMedium Coarse (10-12 Clicks) - Chemex, Drip Coffee Makers, Vacuum Pots\nMedium (7-9 Clicks) - Pour Over Brewers (Including Ours), Aeropress\nMedium-Fine (4-6 Clicks) - Moka Pots, Pour Over Brewers, Aeropress\nFine (1-3 Clicks) - Espresso, Turkish"

            "reviewDate": "January 23, 2018",
            "reviewText": "Build Quality: 5/5\n\nThe exterior components are crafted of heavy weight stainless steel from the bottom up to the hand crank. Each component feels sturdy and long lasting. The grinder breaks down into three pieces: bottom reservoir (part where grinds fall), upper reservoir (part where you place beans), cap (seals off upper reservoir), and the hand crank.\n\nGrind Quality: 5/5\n\nSince this grinder utilizes burr technology, the beans will not be heated during the grinding process like they would from a traditional bladed grinder. Additionally, the particle size is uniform as the grinds only fall to the bottom reservoir once they are small enough to fall through the grinding mechanism, ensuring a uniform size on every ground. This is important when brewing to ensure each grind is subjected to the same amount of heat and water during the brew. Inside the grinding mechanism, there is a portion where you turn it clockwise or counterclockwise to adjust the ground size. There are no markings to know what size is being produced so experimenting will be necessary. I'd recommend starting large and then going small - that way you can recycle the larger grounds and continue the process until you've reached an ideal size.\n\nOverall: 4.5/5\n\nThe reservoir size is quite small, so if you're using this for cold brew where a large quantity of grounds are necessary, you may need to repeat the process several times. It holds about 5 rounded tablespoons of coffee beans (about 1/3 cup). Grind time takes about 1-2 minutes to complete if completely full.\n\nOverall, this grinder has held up so far, produces consistent grounds, and I'm sure will last for many more cups to come."

When I opened it up to look inside, I saw that conical burr piece was not centered with the exterior grinding component (I don't know the proper terms for these pieces). Unfortunately, after getting an espresso machine, the uneven grind and the inability to grind fine enough forced me to use a blade grinder after manually grinding the beans. I have been unable to make a quality espresso using this grinder even at the finest setting, before or after disassembling and cleaning the inside. I will NOT be buying this again and will be looking into a different manual coffee grinder that produces an even grind (which is the point of a burr grinder)."

            "reviewText": "The only real positives to take away form this product seem to be that it's made of fairly strong materials and has a relatively consistent grind size. However, using the actual grinder is more than frustrating. To start, the grinder only holds about enough beans for about one cup of coffee, so prepared to empty and fill numerous times if you plan on grinding more than that. There is no retention feature for the bottom half receptacle, nor is there one for the lever arm you use to grind. As a result, the grinder will fall apart during use if not held in the proper manner. While the grinder has \"settings\" for grind size, they aren't based on anything. Setting the size involves bottoming out the burrs and then backing off from there. There is still no marker for what size you are currently at, if you forgot how many steps you counted or haven't reset the device before using. Setting the size also feels like you may break the thing, given how difficult it is to set.\n\nAvoid this product if possible."

With this grinder, the ability to \"dial in' your grind size is very convenient and helpful. However, due to the nature of the ceramic burr and the drive shaft being loose, grind consistency is lacking. In addition, after 6 months of regular use (used every morning, cleaned every month) two of the plastic pieces in the drive shaft broke causing a clicking sound when grinding and eventually rendering the grinder ineffective and unusable. I would not recommend this grinder for long term use but for travel/occasional usage, as it is not designed for durability in everyday repeated work.\n\nUpdate: I was shipped a replacement grinder with updated parts in December 2017. The grinder worked well until May 2018 and has the same issues as listed above. Plastic pieces inside the grinder break and cause the crank shaft to wobble and the ceramic burr will no longer grind consistently (range of sizes in ground varies greatly). I stand by my initial assessment, as this grinder cannot handle everyday use for more than 6 months at a time. If you make your own coffee everyday like I do, I would suggest spending more money for a better manual grinder that can take the pressure."

You're expected to use 1 hand to grip the smooth cylindrical body (which is about 1.5\" in diameter) and prevent it from spinning while grinding with the handle.\n2. The plastic body, which is cylindrical, is glued to the stainless steel housing. There's a short dowel on the housing and a notch on the body that fit together to keep them from separating from each other. However, the plastic is soft, so of course with only a few uses, the notch is worn, causing the body to move a little and weaken the glue. Eventually the body and housing came apart. It's inevitable. Mind you, I was careful: set at coarse first then grind the coffee again at a finer setting. This should have helped relieve the strain.\n\nCheers,\nDV"

However, just know that it is a hand held burr grinder, and as such there is no gearing to quickly dispatch your grounds. This is a slow methodical process of grinding coffee. If you are going to take this hiking, camping, fishing, hunting, or simply want to go to the beach to make a fantastic cup of joe, this is the right tool for the job, but it will take more than a couple of minutes to grind all the coffee you need for one cup.\n\nI do suggest this for coffee aficionados and connoisseurs, this machine is fantastic, the burr grinder is ceramic, not metallic or plastic and as such creates a perfect grind. Its also very quiet and on cold dark mornings when you are trying to make a cup of coffee before anyone wakes up, this works perfectly. Just don't expect to read anything, or participate in much more than conversation.\n\nIf I were to ask for one thing to be changed, it would be a gear system installed to increase the speed of the burr grinder just 2 times.

            "reviewText": "Overall, a pretty decent manual coffee grinder. There are a few quality-of-life issues that can be annoying; hopefully they will be addressed in a later generation of this product.\n\nPros:\n1) Can grind anything from fine to coarse for a variety of uses\n2) Perfect size for 1-2 people\n3) Doesn't take very long to grind a cup worth on the coarse side of the spectrum (a little more work on the fine side)\n4) Fresh coffee every morning!\n5) Stainless steel is pretty nice\n6) Reasonably priced\n\nCons/Areas for Improvement:\n1) The top slides into the base on the bottom (metal against metal) with no way to hold the two parts together. If you hold by the bottom while grinding, the top will spin and it won't actually grind. If you hold from the top, the bottom comes off spilling coffee grounds everywhere. It is awkward to hold the two pieces together.\n2) Sometimes it's just really hard to grind, and I have no idea why. I've cleaned it thoroughly, and I'm relatively young and strong, so it's not like I lack the strength to grind the beans. It's just hard to get a good grip on the slippery metal, and I end up squeezing so hard my hand hurts (to keep the base from spinning in my hand). A handle would be nice. I've been wrapping that rubber drawer liner around the device to get a better grip.\n3) Kind of difficult to clean\n4) I often switch between coarse for my cold brew (in a French press) and medium-fine for drip, and it can be challenging to find the right grind level each time. The instructions say to grind ~10 beans at a time to see how you should vary the grind level; that is fine if you set it and forget it. If you change often, it just gets annoying, and is a waste of good beans\n5) If you have larger hands, the crank while often rub against your knuckles. You may need to awkwardly crank by your finger tips\n\nDespite the many areas for improvement, I don't regret this purchase; however, I will be looking to replace it when I come across the right product."

            "reviewDate": "June 29, 2019",
            "reviewText": "I bought this grinder to use occasionally for a course grind in a French press or for cold brewing when I buy whole beans. I liked the idea of a manual grinder, so I wouldn't have to worry about any electrical components failing, shorting out, etc. The reviews for this were great, and videos site on the Javapresse website made it seem easy enough to grind.\n\nHowever, this required a LOT more elbow grease than I'd imagined. I tried with some Colombian beans which I filled almost to the top. As you can see from my video, it takes quite a bit of grip and force to get it cranking - someone with weak hands or arthritis definitely wouldn't be able to use this. You can also see that the sleek stainless steel design caused it to just spin right through my hand while trying to grind; it was very hard to get a good grip on it. I tried wrapping it in rubber bands, using a kitchen potholder to add extra grip, and holding it against my chest instead of on the countertop, but it kept on spinning and slipping through my hand. It also kept getting stuck - I'd have to back off a bit and then try again to keep it moving. Besides trying to add more grip, I also tried adding fewer beans (filling halfway instead of to the top), as well as disassembling and reassembling it to make sure the components were lined up correctly, but it still took just as much effort. My hands hurt!\n\nUnless I somehow got a defective model, I can't imagine using this on a daily basis since it took so much effort to grind a quarter cup of coffee, and was almost impossible to keep a good grip on it while grinding because of its smooth design. The only thing I liked about it was its compact design, which could have stayed on the counter without taking up too much space. Sadly, I'll be returning it and will probably replace with an electric blade grinder after all."

To get 15g of finely ground coffee, it took me a little over a minute with the drill. That's for one serving from the Aeropress after several other meticulous steps, including hitting a certain water temp. It was just more than I wanted to do first thing in the morning. May be worth it to you for single serve on a hike, but if tailgate camping; you don't want to be \"that guy\" everyone else in your group is watching while you crank away and they sip drip Folgers at the camp site... or then again, maybe you do."

            "reviewText": "I have never ground a coffee been or made a cup of fresh ground coffee so I do not claim to no anything about grinding coffee.\n\nMy wife accidentally purchased a bag of coffee beans and said \"Hey I bought the wrong kind of coffee, get a coffee grinder so we can use it.\" So as I researched it sounded like burr grinders are the way to go. Here is what I think about the JavaPresse Manual Coffee Grinder.\n\nFirst, the product was packaged well but came with absolutely no directions. However, they do provide a link to their website that provides a video of how to use the product. It is really not that hard. Dump the beans in the top put on the lid and handle and start turning clockwise and you are grinding coffee.\n\nThe construction of the grinder is on point. Definitely good for the price. The grinder is all aluminum construction with a ceramic burr and feels sturdy in your hands.\n\nThe part of the product that is not intuitive is the adjustment of the grind. On this grinder there is a small black dial on the burr that you can turn to change the size of your grind. I turned this dialed all the way to the right and then all the way back to the left. Yes the dial came off in my hand. So I put it back on and dialed it all the way back to the right and then back to the left again. The dial actually clicks when you turn it so I stopped when it stopped clicking. So as I was turning it back to the left I counted the clicks then set the dial in the middle for my first pot of coffee. I had to make three pots of coffee to finally determine the grind that I liked. The adjustability of the burr is apparently a big plus. I am not sure why anyone would want to grind coffee larger than the middle setting of this grinder. I now set the burr about five clicks to the left from all the way to the right.\n\nThe only issues I found with the grinder is that it takes a little while to grind coffee manually so if you are going to make a full pot of coffee it will take you three or four minutes to get the coffee ground up. You have to play with the size of the grind and the amount of coffee to figure out what suits you. The slightly bigger issue is the container on the bottom of the grinder that catches the ground coffee feels like it is going to come off while you are grinding. This causes my to grip the coffee grinder tightly while grinding, expending more energy then I really should have to. If there was some sort of lock formed into the grinder to keep this from happening I would have given five stars.\n\nThe grinder is small and would be excellent for hikers and/or campers who have to have fresh ground coffee. It is small and light and should pack well."

(Something along those lines) My point is he didnt need to say anything but he did, up front he was honest.

At first I was reluctant to try it because I didn't want to mix my coffee flavor with pepper and the other spices but I decided to give it a try after cleaning it. I was amazed that I actually found a pepper grinder/cracker that actually cracked the pepper about as perfect as I wanted, and I needed about 2 cups of fresh cracked pepper. My JavaPresse did it within just a few minutes.\n\nSo long story short, I ended up purchasing my second JavaPresse coffee grinder / spice cracker that I have been looking for so I don't have Just a very sturdy product and the customer service and information is great.

It stores enough beans in the top for about 4-5 cups of coffee so there's no need to bring extra beans when camping for a couple of days. All I need is hot water. I keep mine on the finest setting for the aeropress but I would prefer slightly finer grounds than what this is capable of. The stainless steel body is attractive and rugged however it slips easily in your hand when your cranking. I can remedy this with rubber bands. I haven't used another hand grinder but I believe this will meet anyone's needs who enjoys a gourmet cup of coffee anywhere or to take camping. I gave four stars due to the slippery grip."

Turn it to the right, listen for the clicks and then start turning it back left for less fine grinds. Simple enough. Except that this thing keeeeeeeeeeeeps turning. To no end. And theres no clicking. Okay, maybe Im doing it wrong. Drop the five coffee beans it says to text the grind, pretty damn coarse. Keeeeeeeeeeeeep turning. There should be SOME difference in the grind by now. But no.

I use Black Rifle Coffee Company Coffee and I love doing a medium-coarse grind to compliment my French press and really extract flavors.\nA few tips with this grinder:\n1) Try different grinds to dial in what YOU like. I cant be the definition of what someone would enjoy or not enjoy\n2) When using a French press make sure its at least larger than a medium grind and to give you an idea 18 clicks out is Coarse, 9 clicks out from being completely tightened is Medium and so on.\n3) Cleaning this with a clean and DRY brush is super easy and fast and Ive had 0 issues. Personally I barely clean it. Maybe clean it every 2 weeks unless you're OCD.\n4) Field use is good for it. I have used this as a comfort item while Im in the field and its been in the front of my pack when I jump out of planes on operations. It can take the abuse\n5) When grinding slow and even strokes work best. If you bounce the grinder around it will not grind evenly and youll get a larger grind size than you want.\n\nIn closing Id say the only con is the bottom part that catches the coffee doesnt stay on well and I actually attached a Velcro cord on it that attaches to the bottom to the coffee catchers so it doesnt have to be held closed while coffee is being ground. I do also have to say it takes about 4 minutes for a medium course grind. You wont need a shake weight if you use this thing every day."

It's very easy to see why it gets great reviews!\n\nFirst, this grinder is very small and compact. If space is at a premium, then this is the coffee grinder for you. Perhaps there is a smaller one out there, but I can't imagine there are too many that are a lot smaller.\n\nSecond, the controls/adjustments are minimal: there is the grinding handle, the removable top for loading coffee beans, the removable bottom for emptying the grounds, and an inner adjustment dial for calibrating the size of your grind.\n\nThird, this coffee grinder just feels like a quality item. Most of the parts are made of stainless steel, with minimal use of plastics and the actual grinding component made of ceramic. There's nothing on it that I look at and think \"uh oh, I bet that's gonna break\". Of course, only time will tell but I'm optimistic.\n\nFinally, the quantity of coffee that I can grind with this mill is just right for a cup of coffee. That means that there's no excess to set aside (where it can dry out and lose flavor) or discard. Perfect for someone who wants their morning cup and not an entire pot."

The device itself is beautiful, silver-colored brushed finish, length about 80% distance wrist to elbow, girth circle formed by middle finger and thumb, with a window to see how much coffee you've left to grind.\n\nThe unboxing video explained that filling the container would make two cups of coffee. Can confirm. But did I hear the unboxing video say 1 cup of coffee beans would fit in the hopper? I don't know how much variation there is in coffee bean sizes but I could only fit 1/2 cup Ethiopian Yirgacheffe, and that's a LEVEL 1/2 cup. And yes, even with the smaller 1/2 cup amount, one is likely to spill a bean or two while transferring the beans from measuring cup to hopper. Since even mild annoyances are magnified in the early-morning pre-caffeinated state, I would recommend using a wide mouth funnel for this step of the process.\n\nThe assembly process couldn't be simpler, which makes it a great option for backpackers, but I managed to put the handle upside down onto the cap on my first attempt. The grinder actually worked that way, but it's much easier and faster to use with the black knob on top so that it can rest in the hand. I had enough grinds for my very first cup in about a minute, assembly mistake notwithstanding.\n\nI love how quiet the grinder is, and I love the smell of the freshly ground coffee.

It's very satisfying being able to crunch the beans up yourself. Sort of therapeutic. The reason I took 1 star off though is because my first grinder had a slightly off-center burr so I was getting an uneven grind and the smallest grain size I could get was medium with some larger flakes. The burr would also gradually open as I grinded beans, starting out as medium and ending as big flakes if I didn't stop halfway through and readjust it. I emailed the company and they promptly sent me out a new one. Kudos for that! The new one didn't appear to have the same defect. However after grinding just two full canisters, the burr in the replacement grinder has also become off-center. If I push hard enough I can recenter it, but it'll just go back out of alignment halfway through the grinding process. But it isn't nearly as bad as the first one, so it's not that big of a deal. If you're looking for perfect consistency, spend more on a grinder, but if you're like me, brand new to the world of grinding coffee beans, then you know it's really not that big of a deal for $20. The company is really nice and generous so I still feel like my money was pretty well spent."

This is my first manual grinder. Please. This is my very first grinder. I've gone from drinking instant Bustelo to Lavazza in a moka pot to now buying organic dark roast from Fairways. I will be traveling in a few weeks and was simply looking for something easy to pack (and use) as I'm going with steadfast faith to come in contact with a local personal or business roaster. Grinder arrived quickly as I am a prime member. I easily assembled the grinder which included finding the correct grind setting and I'm no pro. I read the preceding company email but I just forged ahead and put enough beans in to grind a single serving (not recommending this - I was excited). Read comments so knew this wasn't going to be a very quick process. Didn't even time it. I was in love with my beans from the first whiff. Yummmm. Meh, maybe 1.5 minutes. I don't know. I don't spin the crank but churn with love. Placed ground coffee in moka pot. I sipped that coffee , nursed the mug and my eyes rolled to the back of my head. YO! OH THE LIFE THAT IS AHEAD OF ME!! So now I've been using this daily. I love cranking it. It builds up my anticipation for coffee. Like the company email states: Your grinder is now ready for use anywhere in the world! Yeah!!!!! And I paid full price for this and have no affiliation to JavaPresse blah blah blah."

The ceramic burr has a hole in the center that the metal shaft connects to. It is secured to the shaft with a piece of plastic. The center plastic on mine broke and the shafts just spins, not turning the burr at all. However, when it did work It worked great. I was able to enjoy many of cups of fresh ground coffee because of it. I wouldn't recommend using it full time at home, but for a small simple grinder to take camping it would be fine."

            "reviewText": "UPDATE 11/20/2017\n\nAfter writing my initial review the Javapresse company reached out to me and sent me a brand new grinder free of charge. I have to say the original one I received must have been defective because the one that they sent over works great! I can pull an amazing shot out of it using my Gaggia espresso machine and it tastes great. I also purchased a grinder from another company here on amazon that looked the same as the JavaPresse however it seems to me that the JavaPresse actually grinds the beans faster at the same consistency. All in all I am very happy they reached out to me and now I can happily change my rating to a 5 star.!\n______________________________\n\nIncredibly disappointed with this product. When I received it the packaging looked great and I was really excited to start using it, seemed simple and easy enough to use. After putting in my coffee bean I noticed immediately something was wrong as the burr grinder would not spin. I removed the beans and tested it, and the burr grinder began to spin. So I added the beans back again and to no avail the grinder did not spin. I did this a couple of more times and then I simply added 1 coffee bean, that stopped the grinder from spinning as well.\n\nI then though well maybe it was assembled wrong, after inspecting the device further I noticed that the burr inside the grinder was not sturdy at all and moved all over the place, I am not sure how a grinder that has the burr moving so much could ever produce a consistent grind. However I can't confirm this as I was not able to even grind 1 bean. Now ill have to order from a different company and won't be able to enjoy my espresso for another 3 days, and for a coffee lover like myself this makes me furious, hence the one star review."

I had to fiddle with it a few times to get it to grind again. The grinds ended up very fine every time no matter how many clicks, I did for a course grind. Took it apart and redid it a few times, with all the same results. Good for traveling and portability if it works to not give me a espresso grind everytime. I dont think I am allowed to return this after some use of it, I wish I could, $25 landfill. I cannot recommend."

            "reviewText": "Recommended item. Works great. Will grind as fine as you need and fine enough for lever espresso machine. It is comfortable to use as you can grind vertical and horizontal. It works and does a great job and you can't beat the price. And the receptacle that holds the coffee after it is ground fits into the portafilter so you can tap the coffee right into it. How smart! I like it and I have nothing negative to say about the machine. Keep in mind that it ain't an electric machine so you will grind 14 grams of coffee in about 10 minutes or less.\n\nI do have something negative to say about the instructions which are a waste of time and so is the website video showing the dude that likes to listen to himself going on on on and wasting time. What needs to be shown clearly is: in what direction do the washers go when putting the machine back together after cleanning. Up or down? Can't be seen clearly in the video or in the instructions that come with the unit. A waste of time trying to figure it out. There is a top washer that needs to be put back correctly either up or down and a bottom washer that also needs to be put back in the correct direction. The information provided is a waste of time. Also, some type of warning needs to be given so that no grinding is attempted in the zero position because seems to me-I don't know-that the burrs can be worn down or damaged. If it doesn't matter, hey, more to power you but I heard crunching in the zero position. It's a great machine but Javapresse should have paid little more money an have gotten better qualified people to provide the instructions and the video on the machine. It ain't rocket science to crank the handle but clear instructions would be helpful. But other than that, I personally like and recommend this unit."

It might take longer if you are using a finer grind setting, but Im glad I dont have to deal with that.\n\nWhat I do is grind it the night before, so when I wake up at 5 am for work, all I gotta do is just heat up the water in the electric kettle, get dressed up, and then brew it after the water has heated"

When grinding medium-course for Chemex, this produces a ton of fines. These fines over extract and add bitterness to every cup you brew. Today, half the grinds were medium course and the other half were fine! It clogged the filter and ruined the brew! If you're grinding more fine for Aeropress then this thing works okay, but truly you'd be better off saving your money, increasing your budget, and buying a much nicer grinder."

Mainly because I'm just using it for a Chemex 3 cup and me looking to on average brew 2-3 cups a coffee at a time. The support for this product from the OE was outstanding before I even opened the box.\nI have used it twice now, it is a high quality product however the ability to dial the coarseness in is difficult at best. There is only one little non-marked or indicated wheel at the bottom with the hopper removed. One direction for coarse one for fine but no way of telling without actually grinding what level it is to either. I find this quite frustrating when trying to dial in the exact right coarseness for pour over coffee. I need to seek some support from the manufacturer to see if there is something I'm missing but nothing that is outlined in the instructions. I've even started looking again at low end price point electrics to avoid this hassle. Not a bad review overall as once again the support and build quality of this item is great and it does grind very consistently far surpassing my old blade only electric grinder."

Anyone who needs to make good coffee without electricity. Anyone who makes coffee when the rest of the house is sleeping. Its very quiet. Someone who wants excellent home brew coffee but whos budget wont cover an electric burr grinder.\n\nIf I like it so much why 4 stars instead of 5? Its slow. It takes longer to fine grind for 1 cup of coffee than it takes to heat the water. Grinding enough for a 12 cup coffee maker is a chore.\nFeatures I like:\nCeramic cone grinding surface makes very uniform sized coffee grounds, which makes very good coffee. Metal parts are precision stainless steel. It is the first grinder I have owned that will grind fine enough to make Turkish coffee. Easy to use and easy to adjust from course to fine grind. Removing the adjustment screw opens the insides for cleaning. It is very quiet. Looks and feels like it will last a long time. It is large enough to make enough grounds for a very stong 12 cups.\nLimitations: Other than how long it takes to grind, the only limitation I see is that if you also grind spices you are going to need a separate grinder. The main working surfaces are easy to get to and clean but there are some crevasses around the grinding cone that you cant get the coffee powder all out of.\nBottom line, I will keep and use this grinder but I am going to spring for an electric burr grinder for everyday use."

Javapresse customer service was excellent, sending me another grinder AND a refund, however, due to damage, and other design flaws, I can't recommend this grinder. 1 star for grinder, 1 star added for excellent customer service.\n\nPros\n- Excellent customer service\n- Cheap\n- Light\n\nCons\n- inconsistent grind - feels like you're crushing beans rather than slicing them, giving you a wide range of grind sizes, especially if youre trying to grind coarser, say for a french press. This made for very inconsistent brewing. Only an Aeropress recipe with a fine grind size worked okay.\n- very slow to grind (takes 3-5 minutes for a fine setting)\n- the handle isnt very comfortable (not a big deal, but for such a long grind time, it would be nice)\n- basket is too loose (slips as you grind - it never fell completely, but I always had to make sure my hand was covering both parts to ensure that it wouldnt)\n- not durable (see photo)\n- grinds get stuck in basket - weird design with a little lip at the bottom, so fine grounds will get stuck, forcing you to smack it a bunch to loosen them up. (see photo)\n- after disassembling and reassembling to clean, my grind settings werent the same. Requires re-figuring to dial in the recipe.\n\nReplaced it with a Comandante C40, which isnt fair to compare as thats in a completely different class, but all these problems listed above are gone. You do get what you pay for.\n\nSpeculative note: If I were to travel and wanted to take an Aeropress and this grinder, I would be okay, although a smaller one like the Porlex mini would probably be a better choice. If you want something of a little higher quality yet, but still small and portable, Id consider the Aergrind knock."

I absolutely love everything about this except I'm 50 & I have arthritis so it is a bit of a struggle to get my sore hands to work through the 3 minutes of hand grinding early in the morning. But, this is not the fault of the grinder for sure! It is still worth the efforts & the wait for the quality of brew! My only complaint is that there is no way to keep the setting so if you change to a different type of brew, you will have to play with it a bit to find the right spot & then be willing to loose it the next time you change. Right now I have a perfect pour over set but eventually I will want to make french press or espresso & I will have to take the time to adjust it & grind some beans until I find the perfect spot. It isn't rocket science to adjust it, I just miss my old machine where I put a sticker on the settings I preferred...this one, due to it's size & design, won't allow for such luxuries.

There are two very minor drawbacks: [1] I need to keep one hand sort of wrapped around the top as I load the beans, since the opening is not very wide (the device is a consistent cylinder); and [2] due to the narrow diameter, it is a little challenging to clean (I usually take a paper towel or a couple of tissues, and use that with a couple of fingers to wipe out the inside). BUT - the very feature that results in these minor challenges (the narrow diameter of the device) is what makes it SO easy to store and to take travelling. And at this price?!?? Fantastic :)"

It takes me one to two minutes to grind a tablespoon of coffee beans. Since I'm using a small coffee maker that's okay.

This means that you have to very carefully wiggle the handle to get the grinder to continue grinding, or just 'push past' and break the grinder. After about a week, I was stuck on the adjustment i was on, and today... while grinding, it screwed itself completely tight (to the finest grind) and jammed.\n\nAlso, the outer metal is pretty reactive with kitchen surfaces.

Even though it's not the usual \"name brand\" hand grinder that everyone recommends, I took a chance because I liked the look and construction of this unit. I have been beyond pleased with this grinder as it produces a consistent grind and is easy to adjust. Other reviewers mentioned the amount of time it takes to grind beans and I can confirm that it does take between 90-120s to grind coffee for on serving. However, it turns out that 120s is just about the time it takes for the Bonavita kettle to warm water so it's a great pairing. This is not the right grinder for people wanting to serve more than one cup of coffee at a time (the capacity is just too small). For the price, this is a great hand grinder that perfectly complements my Aeropress coffee ritual."

I couldve called and had them grind the beans but decided its time to take my coffee to the next level and get a bean grinder. Since it is my first, I wanted something simple and inexpensive in case I didnt like it.\n\nThis grinder is pretty simple to use. Put the beans in the top and turn the handle. Since I have a Keurig and only brew one cup at a time, this was perfect. Takes about a minute to grind the beans in this grinder and has multiple settings. The canister for the grounds is perfect to pour into my reusable Keurig filter k-cup. Multiple settings to change how fine you grind the beans. If you are looking to grind more than enough beans for 2 cups might be a pain, but I have fallen in love of the process of grinding my beans fresh and then brewing my coffee. You could probably grind beans for 4 cups maybe a little more but youll be turning the handle for about a minute per cup. Ive been a coffee drinker for 25 years and when I used this with my newfound beans I love, it was by far the best coffee I have ever had. This is also perfect for travel and considering taking this and my beans on an Alaskan cruise next month. The thought of sitting on the deck watching the scenes of Alaska with the perfect cup of coffee is just paradise."

            "reviewText": "You'll be most pleased with this grinder if you drink pour over or AeroPress or are using reusable K-cups for a Keurig-type machine and want to use fresh-roasted coffee.\n\nThe freshness of the roast is THE most important factor in a good cup of coffee. If your coffee is over 10 days old, you shouldn't really expect it to taste very good. If the bag has a \"best used by\" date, I wouldn't buy it. You really want the bag to state the date the coffee was roasted. Not date shipped, not date packaged. DATE ROASTED. There's good reason to support your local or mail-order artisan coffee roaster, or to roast the beans yourself: the coffee will taste SO MUCH BETTER.\n\nIf you make espresso with this grinder it will be hit-and-miss, as very minor differences in granularity can have major effects on taste when making espresso. Different espresso roasts, different beans, and different degrees of freshness of roast all require very fine tweaking of the grind. Sometimes this JP grinder will be in the \"sweet spot\" for your roast and sometimes not.\n\nIt takes 175-200 turns of the crank to produce a fine grind for one espresso. The burr diameter is very small, and that's what takess so many turns. The hopper holds enough coffee beans for two updosed double espressos, or a small French Press. It's fairly easy to refill. But if you're trying to make coffee for a foursome, or a couple of cups each for two people, a larger grinder would be better.\n\nThe JavaPresse's granularity is inconsistent at its coarsest setting.\n\nI'd like to see a bigger version of the JavaPresse, one with the diameter of a SODA CAN, and with a larger burr to match. A bearing reinforcement plate for the burr would be a good idea. A larger model should produce a more consistent coarse grind for French Press while producing a fine grind too, and it should do so with fewer turns of the crank.\n\nIf the larger model had the same fit and finish, and those enhancements, it would easily be worth twice the price."

So I started to look around for a replacement. A lot of options out there now (not that many 20 years ago). I won't say I'm a \"coffee snob\" but to some, maybe I am. I always grind my own and use my espresso maker for a 4 shot cup. I use Espresso, Italian, French roasts, and change pace with Guatemalan and Sumatra.\nI saw this one after reading a lot more in-depth articles on grinders. The best you can really get are the conical ceramic burr grinders, not the old blades I have been using. The burr process actually grinds the coffee beans in a consistent size and not heat up the beans like metal blades.\nSo, I thought what the heck, and this one looked like fun and possibly the even size will be easier on my machine.\n\nWOW! First cup, I was amazed! Not sure it was just some sort of anticipation or not, so had a second cup, then switched to Sumatra for another cup! Yep, results were all the same. The even size and gentle grinding actually produced more body and flavor and took the bite/edge right off of the espresso roast. Karen (coffee hater) wasn't sure to believe me, but I make an Americano for my grandson Joseph Heider Saturday mornings, he even claimed the coffee was a lot smoother!\n\nIf you start looking for a new grinder, I strongly suggest and know you won't be disappointed using the Ceramic Conical Grinders.

It's perfect for that function.\n\nSee my review for the Gator on how to make an incredibly hot cup of coffee when you use chilled cream.\n\nIf anyone has ideas on how to keep this clean, please leave a comment.

I actually didn't know there was a bean stuck in there - but I did notice the ceramic cylinder had gotten just a tiny bit cockeyed. After being taken apart COMPLETELY, it was found that the pressure from the bean had loosened the black liner from the stainless steel. Because of this, when the crank was turned - the beans spun around with it. So ... we took it apart again, and applied a food grade silicon sealant to reattach it to the stainless. Used it again this morning - and it's as good as new. I really do like this grinder, so we'll do what we can to keep it going strong."

This tend to happen more in a place where humidity is high and coffee beans are not freshly roasted.\n\nCompared to other brand that I used for over 4 years ( go find out which one is the second best rated here on amazon) this is not an improvement , but it looks like they are good at marketing this design and the brand so I thought I would give it a try.

I could not seem to get a fine grind, always seemed coarse. I thought it was just my inexperience, so I kept experimenting over the next couple weeks with the adjustment knob but kept getting similar results, went to the javapresse website and watched all the videos. Then, the black knob on the handle fell off! So, I emailed customer service. They were super responsive (emailed back within a few hours) and immediately said they would send out a full replacement right away. I received the replacement the very next day. Did a test grind and got much better results. Now that I have something to compare, on the original grinder I received, the adjustment knob wasn't \"clicking\" and could never seem to get beyond a coarse grind. I can't comment on the durability etc of the grinder since I haven't had it long, will come back and update if I run into any problems.\nSo, if your grinder doesn't seem to be working like it should, contact customer service!"

The first day I used it, I gripped onto the main body of the grinder and started my process and halfway through the bottom fell out.... all my hard work grinding thus far was on the floor... what a mess...\n\n2) the necessity to hold the bottom compartment makes it difficult to hold the main body firmly while grinding. This was especially true for finer grinds (I was using it for my Aeropress) and noticed that if I didn't hold the body firmly it would just start spinning, but trying to hold both compartments (body and bottom grind compartment) was a strain on my hand and arm. If there was a silicone grip on the body, it would make it much easier (that or textured metal) because the shiny smooth steel makes it hard to prevent it from spinning alongside the grinder arm.\n\nOther than that, I have been enjoying this fun little grinder and making consistent grinds for my daily coffee.\n\nRecommended!"

This does not hinder the performance on the grinder, however. The handle just slips over the shaft on top, no screw down, This easy takedown is nice for storage as the crank arm is not sticking out. You will be cranking for awhile, but the results speak for themselves and I recommend it. 4 stars, because time has not been a measurable factor yet and there is always something better to be discovered.

My cups of Joe taste more consistent every morning and without all the funky sediment that the other machine left behind. The ONLY drawback thus far after a week of use is, I have to make coffee for both my wife and me and we drink A LOT! 5 cups between the both of us. Using a coffee formula on the internet, I found that I have to grind two and a half mills (around 66 grams) of coffee for our French press every single morning.

Double filtered because I want paper filters, but have to use a basket regardless. This slows the drip rate, so I must grind more coarse.\n\nMy grinder is set to a 14-15 click setting and it takes me 1.5 minutes to ground 20g of coffee. Double the amount, double the time basically. The hopper seems to only fit 40g of my coffee, but I drink 50g everyday.. so I have to do two groups of grinding. Not really an issue. It takes about as long to grind as it takes my kettle to heat up, so I don't see much of a difference in brew time. Just effort.\n\nOverall, a decent grinder. Kind of slow, but what do you expect from a hand grinder? I'm sure with finer grinds it will be longer, so be aware."

I have not been able to find a setting I like. It's either been too fine or too coarse. It's also incredibly inconsistent; I typically grind 20g of beans at a time, it will start out grinding normally but then as it gets to the end of the coffee it gets immensely more coarse. It also always gets giant chunks of coarse grounds stuck in it no matter how fine the grind starts. I'm very unsatisfied with this product. I will be searching for a better alternative that can do its job."

My only complaint then was that there was no detent or clicks I read about them having to have a consistent grind setting. I assume my model was an older version. My first one lasted about 3 months before the black plastic piece that holds the ceramic burr on the shaft broke in half. That was a bummer but customer service did me a solid. They sent me an upgraded replacement burr to fix it (New white plastic piece vs old black piece) and a second, upgraded model.\n\nI now exclusively use the new unit as it is superior, has detents for consistent sized grinds, and the nut (what determines the size) doesnt seem to want to fall off like the last one.\n\nDo not get this unit if you have an issue with grinding out grounds for minutes and have multiple people waiting on the results. I only use it for about 100 grams every two days for my own needs and its perfect, and somewhat therapeutic.\n\nThe customer service rep was great to work with and gave me more than I expected."

The second one works okay but it's still not very clear which setting the grinder is on. The grinder settings are based on the number of clicks but the clicks are inconsistent or too subtle to hear. So I was essentially flying blind when it came to the grind setting.\n\nThe second issue is how long it takes to grind one scoop of beans. I'd say it took me about 3-4 minutes to fully grind all the beans. I love the concept of not burning the beans with an electric motor but hand grinding them is a big effort. Too much effort at 6:30 am. Probably too much at noon. Having said that, I would recommend this grinder for travel, for camping, etc., but not as your main grinder. Unless you have wildly muscular wrists or you're thinking about living off the grid."

It is faster on a coarse grind like for French press. My grinder has NOT broken despite daily use for months. I even hooked mine up to a cordless drill once or twice like another reviewer suggested, which I'm sure the manufacturer does not advise. It worked, but it was still a bit slow, granted I didn't use max speed on the drill. Anyway, if you don't mind cranking away for a few minutes each morning (or better, each night to prepare for the next day), definitely buy this. Also would make a great camping tool for long trips (I would just bring fresh grounds on a short trip). I will eventually pony up for an electric conical ceramic burr grinder."

I was originally shopping for an electric burr grinder, but after seeing a polar price range and the very mixed reviews, I decided to give a manual burr grinder a try. I've had mine for about a month and it's been used a few times now. It keeps an even grind and makes for wonderful coffee in my french press. It does have some pieces when it's disassembled to clean that you have to keep an eye on because they are small (a couple washers and the spring inside), but I have to disassemble my french press anyways, so I don't mind.\n\nI ran into a small issue after reassembling the first time. I discovered that the black, star shaped piece that twists to set the grind size has grooves on one side, but not the other. When reassembling, you need to be sure to have the grooves facing the white grinder, or else it won't make the \"clicks\" to recalibrate the grinder. Also, if facing the wrong way, the black piece and grinder will adjust as you turn the handle, making an uneven grind size.\n\nCustomer service is super nice, quick to respond, and helpful!\n\nAfter figuring that out, I'm quite happy with the purchase!"

The coarseness is easily adjustable, and can grind down to Turkish coffee fineness. As the seller's images show, it is slim, about the diameter of a paper towel core, so is easy for a small adult hand to grip. The handle slips on and off easily - it's not fastened - so it can be stored compactly.\n\nMy only quibble is with the free coffee offer. Sure, it's not unreasonable for them to ask me to pay shipping, but I wanted to know how much that would be before committing to pay it. I didn't give them my card number, and aborted the process. I'd knock off a star for this, except the product is very nice."

Received, packaged excellent with plenty bubble wrap. No Scratch's on brushed steel. There are no threads for the top and bottom, it is a snug compression fit, slightly difficult to pull apart initially, once done no need to press together with much force. Tried the fine grind first as that was how it shipped. This took awhile and I was not sure it was working, so watch their video or loosen to half way between fine and course and you will be pleased. We are talking single cup brewing. No mess as with electric grinders, my number 1 reason,\n2 pours beautifully into single cup filter 3 no cord 4 sleek enough to leave out and I place near my salt and pepper grinders. Highly recommended and makes for a great cup of Joe. Well done JavaPresse!"

Once we received the JavaPresse, I pulled out our French Press that we havent used in a long time and made delicious coffee! The JavaPresse perfectly grinds coffee beans to brew in any type of coffee maker. All you have to do is grind about six beans to find the right consistency for your personal taste and the type of coffee youre brewing...I have found that a coarser grind is perfect for a French Press, a medium fine grind works well in a Keurig, and a fine grind is best for espresso. Im looking forward to making cold brew coffee in the summer with coarse grounds. I am very impressed with the JavaPresse company and their customer service. The grinder was packaged nicely and included instructions and suggestions for its use. They have also emailed me about three times to thank me for the order as well as checking on my satisfaction. If you love coffee and appreciate the difference in its taste from grinding fresh coffee beans, please do not hesitate to order the JavaPresse grinder!"

I would not recommend this grinder if you are trying to grind for more than two people, but it is a perfect for one or two people.\n\nThe manual grinding takes some time, but that's what you'd expect with a manual grinder. It is really quick if you use a french press, but it'll take more time the finer you want a grind. With my French press, I can get the water heating and easily grind all the coffee I need before my water is hot enough. The grind is good and easily adjusted, though I wish that the click instructions were etched into the side of the grinder for easy access. I really like the removable handle as it makes the grinder convenient for travel or in a small kitchen without the space for something larger.\n\nThe only two things I wish were that it was easier to clean (not terribly difficult, but its size makes it challenging) and that it had a larger opening for the whole beans. It's convenient size means that a person has to be careful when loading the grinder.\n\nOverall, happy with this product."

It takes about 10 minutes to grind 4 or five ccuos worth of Java. The handle just rests on the top on a hex bolt and is not secured it easily comes off in your hand while spinning.\nThe outer stainless body conceals a plastic liner (bean hopper) that stays in place via a tiny notch and corresponding indent in the stainless outer body. This keeps it from spinning with the handle .. or does it?\nThe alleged ceramic grinding wheel is tiny hence the minuscule amount of beans going through it per minute. I cant see this mechanism lasting more than a month of daily use. This is a great travel companion on a camping trip but avoid if you are a daily home coffee lover."

But I'm adjusting quickly.\n\nThe grinder itself is easy to hold and has a clean look to it. I'm still adjusting my grind. I use a fairly new Moccamaster cone filter drip coffee maker with an electric grinder (Black & Decker) which has flat grinding mill wheels for a long time. Coffee from the JavaPresse grinder smells better, richer than grounds from the electric. There's also another layer of taste that I didn't get before, but that seems to vary quickly with grind settings, so I'm still 'tweaking' the grind.\n\nAll in all, an excellent addition to my kitchen, and the little bit of work it takes to get your morning cuppa makes the taste more savory. And it's a WHOLE lot quieter than the electric was."

If you want to walk around and grind with this, you need to be able to hold both the lid and the bottom piece to the main grinding body, which requires large, strong hands. I have big hands, but my hands usually get cramped from holding this together every day and I usually also have to hold it against my stomach or leg as well.

My old blade grinder was louder than a commercial vacuum cleaner. The trick to getting a decent grind out of this device is to run your grounds through TWICE. I thought I wasn't setting it fine enough at first as there were large chunks of bean in my grounds after one pass. After two passes, you get a pretty consistent grind.\n\nIt doesn't take very long to grind enough beans (just under four tablespoons) for my small french press. Maybe a little bit longer than it takes my electric kettle to heat up the water, which happens rather quickly. I haven't timed it but it's not a bothersome amount of time.\n\nIf you're looking to grind coffee for large batches, say for drip coffee, you'll have to do several batches to get enough grounds.

Having done this before, I had to leave many items behind that I am now having to replace, having returned to the States. This grinder, so far, works well, though I am still having to figure out the right coarseness for my French press. The one downside is that it takes longer than the reviews stated to grind 4 Tablespoons of grounds needed for my morning pot. Rather than the 2 minutes quoted, I found that it takes twice as long. Since I am not much of a morning person until I've had some coffee, I have found it works best to grind the next mornings batch the night before. Not the optimal arrangement, as the sooner the coffee is ground, it seems the fresher the coffee, but it is working for me.\n\nThis grinder has a 2 year warranty, but then the directions state the burr grinding mechanism may be worn down and require replacement. I have no idea how much that may cost. My last electric grinder was going on 8 years old when I had to leave it behind in the States. I am a bit disappointed to anticipate having to do this within a few years, and I hope that the price is reasonable to replace the burrs.\n\nThe grinder is very compact and attractively designed. I have some arthritis in my hands, but using this grinder has not put any undue stress or caused pain in my hands. The grinder is easy to use; it just takes longer than I anticipated. Overall, so far, I am satisfied with my purchase. We'll see how I feel in 2 years, should I have to replace the burrs and find out their cost!"

            "reviewText": "Takes longer for very fine grind and can be fatiguing but this should be expected if you desire a very fine grind in a manual grinder. The small diameter is easy to hold in the hand but can be difficult after grinding for a while. There is no securing the grinder handle to the top so it is possible that the handle can come off while grinding but this is rarely an issue. The grind at finer levels through most all of the coarsest appear to be very consistent. I have made drip, pour over, espresso and Turkish and all came out well with some experimentation to find the best grind. Overall construction is solid and no instability is felt while grinding. The clear window in the grinder cup allows for viewing of the amount of coffee ground. The knob on the bottom of the grinder burr allows for selecting your grind size by \"clicks\". This feels a bit sloppy and loose but the \"clicks\" are easily felt when turning the knob. Overall, nice grinder, easily portable if you love your beans to go."

The second time I used it however, the black knob fell off because the bolt is not long enough to resist the amount of turning of the handle that is required. I tried using two screwdrivers (yeah awkward) to reattach it but it just keeps popping off no matter how tight I get it. I thought maybe the bolt broke but there isn't a piece inside and I can't find a piece so I'm guessing it was supposed to be that short? Not sure. I will be returning it."

We don't use bladed electric grinders because they heat the ingredients enough that they release too much of their fragrance constituents. This kind of assisted hand grinding produces the best result for things that depend on keeping all their lovely aromas intact.

Unfortunately my experience so far has been frustrating and the coffee I've brewed disappointing.\n\nThe instructions are unclear and unhelpful. I've spent a few hours over the past week alone trying to figure out how to configure the grind quality between rereading the instructions multiple times, rewatching the video they link you, and just testing it out by hand, and I still cannot figure out how to properly do this. You're told you do this by \"turning it all the way to the right and hearing x amount of clicks\", but after turning knobs for too long in either direction, I'm not given any obvious cues to tell me how to adjust it properly. First I grinded them too coarsely, then I somehow was able to adjust it to its finest setting and I can't get out out of it. Being able to adjust this should be obvious!\n\nThis is on top of the time commitment actually grinding the coffee, which as users have pointed out can take at least 2 minutes but for me has taken closer to 5. It doesn't seem like much, but 2-5 minutes of actively grinding beans is deceptively long and it adds up. Imagine you're planking 2-5 minutes and that's how pleasant the experience is.\n\nIt pains me to leave this review because this is a small business that seems to genuinely care about its product and customers. I really wanted to start enjoying the home brewing experience, but unfortunately I can't recommend this product to anyone given the frustrating experience I've had with it."

It wiggles around in your hands. The top and bottom parts will start to move independently unless one grips them properly. You can't rest the base on a counter for additional stability because of the narrow design.\n\nTakes me about 4 mins to grind 25 grams of java beans.

I wanted to replace my Krups electric blade gender and get a coarse grind for a French Press and Percolator. I use several brands of Organic beans, from Costco, on-line sites and local roasters\nThe Java Press produces a nice coarse grind for my tastes and is simple to operate and easy to clean. I clean every 2-3 weeks and recommend using a bowl of warm soapy water to soak the parts, then rinse and dry on a paper towel. Make certain you have both the black plastic and metal washers to bookend the spring and be careful around the sink.\n\nI have taken the grinder and my French Press trailer camping along with a good supply of bean. Grind, brew\nand drink, no problem. Also I take the the Java Press in my carry-on when flying - Not necessary to forego a great cup of coffee when you travel.\n\nBedst part: The company website is extremely helpful and Irene and Raj are available for email questions They deeply care that we are satisfied customers and will go the distance to provide excellent servic. When the black plastic insert in the reovable burr got cracked, I eamiled Irene at Java Press, a photo of the issue. She was on it immediately and sent a replacement grinder with the newest burr that contains a nylon center suppot, an upgrade over plastic. Her support was off the chart.\n\nThe Java Press is a 5 star winner for a manual burr grinder and the customer service gets 10 Stars** Java Press is one of the best values at Amazon and will produce the grind you need to fine-tune a great cup of Joe. I grind every morning and in a few minutes have fresh gound beans\nsteeping away. Quality product + excellent support. Go with it."

You have to be sure to hold them both together while cranking the handle on top while grinding or the bottom half drops off and you lose all your freshly ground coffee. Seems like it should have been machined a little closer in tolerance so they held together more securely? Unsure if this is with all of them or if mine is defective."

Normal size beans, even with a fine grind, just takes a couple minutes to grind for a single serve. Nice warm up in the morning to get the blood flowing. Grinding for two cups of coffee occasionally is fine. Mostly intended for a single cup. Wouldn't want to grind for more than 2+ cups though."

In the short time I have had this grinder it has already helped me achieve a much more satisfying, full bodied flavor in my cup. The other thing that led me to take the time and endorse this product, is the companies assistance online. Once you have the grinder, the website is very helpful in understanding the coffee experience more fully, while explaining in detail about the use/care/maintenance of the little grinder. Very solid. I am thankful for what I now own and for what I a have learned online through this companies site."

It arrived well packaged, was simple to figure out how to use and set the grind level and even had some handy dandy video links to watch for best operation, grinds and cleaning. I use it every day to make my single cup of coffee and it took less time to grind the beans than I had expected. (About 2-3) minutes. I am not sure I'd want to do this if I was making more coffee, but for me it is perfect. I'm getting ready to go abroad for a year and am taking this along with my Aeropress (mill fits inside of it nicely). I would buy this again and would recommend to anyone. AND my coffee was much better than it was with my $45 electric grinder - that kept jamming."

It only takes a few minutes to grind a full load in there and that's good for two large coffee cups of regular-strength coffee or one strong one.\n\nIf you want a hands-free grind, or need more capacity there are electric burr grinders available or you can pre-cook the flavor out of your beans using a high-speed blade grinder like I used to. Your choice. :D"

Luckily my significant other was home and he was able to figure out that I'd somehow managed to dislodge the inner chamber that holds the ceramic outer part of the grinder. (I don't know what any of the individual pieces are called, please bear with me.) Inside of the outer metal sleeve there is a black plastic sleeve that helps to hold the outer ceramic ring in place. I think maybe the black sleeve is normally glued in, but somehow mine had come out, and my attempts at grinding just spun this inner sleeve in circles without grinding a dang thing. After cleaning it out with the trusty qtip technique demonstrated on the website, he was able to line up the pieces correctly to keep them in place, and voila! My coffee grinder is cleaner and more functional than ever! Now I know what I'm working with so I can handle it if it happens again."

Did a test grind per recommended, and made a slight adjustment and got a nice grind.\n\nPros: Easy to use, simple to adjust. Got 5 cups from it, which is my coffee maker maxes out at, so that was perfect. Wasn't hard to manually grind the coffee, and quiet.\n\nCons: Took about 5 minutes to grind. Didn't notice any marks to show where you are at on the adjustments (so when you find that nice grind, easiest to keep it)."

Even though I could never hear/feel the clicks, I was able to produce a cup of excellent coffee after a few grind experiments. However, after using it about every other day for just two weeks, I started noticing uneven grinds. A fine to medium fine setting yields ground sizes ranging from powders to 1/8 a bean. The grinder itself is definitely off axis, with one side almost kissing the rim and the other side a gaping hole in between, and I've even begun to suspect that the grinder loosened as I was grinding because the grounds that came out later were coarser than when it started ... Now, I've been using it to do pour overs, so the coffee I make with it is still passable for now (with a tinge of sour in an otherwise flavorful cup -_-), but I have already started looking for another grinder\n\nEdited to Add: Troubleshooted tonight and discovered that I had put the adjustment knob backwards after my first cleaning ... I can feel the clicks now :). Will update in a week or two on whether I'm still experiencing the above mentioned problems."

The grinder top fits into the base that receives the ground coffee by friction fit only, so the force of grinding can cause the top to turn in the base. It needs a countertop base so it doesn't have to be held during grinding, some sort of grip to make it comfortable and a little brush to get the powdery coffee out of the base.

            "reviewDate": "January 6, 2019",
            "reviewText": "After recently kicking my soda habit and replacing it with coffee, I've begun to explore the world of coffee snobbery  without becoming a snob, and without spending Jeff Bezos amounts of money. That is what led me to the somewhat Zen-like practice of manually grinding whole beans and, thus, to the JavaPresse.\n\nIf you're currently all jacked up on caffeine with hundreds of things to do and no patience for reading, I will summarize by saying that this is a worthy, affordable purchase and it will serve you well. It will also make you, as you walk around the office grinding beans, feel superior to all the lesser humans sipping on their instant coffee, energy drinks and/or hard alcohol.\n\nIf, however, you have a bit of time then I'll outline the three aforementioned quibbles:\n\n1) Powdered plastic after a grind session. In the attached photos, you'll find before/after shots of the top of the grind axle. You can see a fine, white powder that shows up after grinding. I'm assuming this is a result of friction between the plastic washer and the metal bolt. While I don't fancy consuming plastic, I'm not overly concerned since I could eat the entire washer with no probable ill effects. If teens can survive Tide pods, a few micrograms of plastic is inconsequential.\n\n2) Slightly-offset axle alignment. Also in the attached photos, you'll see two shots of the floating burr. At 180 degrees apart, the distance from the floating burr to the mounted burr differs by a moderate amount. The result is a less than perfectly-consistent grind size. I imagine that engineering a perfectly aligned grind axle would increase the cost of the JavaPresse by a significant margin. I'd estimate that only the elite upper 3% of coffee drinkers would consider this a major flaw and turn up their pretentious noses to it (Im looking at you, avocado toast-eating Millenials from California). It's only a very minor annoyance to the shadow of my subconscious perfectionist.\n\n3) Inconsistently-floating floating burr. This is what annoys me the most. In the last photo, you'll see circled in red where the burr has too much room to float on the plastic X-shaped insert upon which it is mounted. There is a spring that puts pressure on the plastic sleeve to keep it at a consistent distance from the housing, but because the floating burr has so much room to move on the insert, it often gets stuck at a distance I don't want it at. During the first few days of use I occasionally ended up with espresso powder because the burr had gotten stuck too far up. I've forged the habit of checking the burr before each use and, if necessary, pulling it down to ensure it's flush with the plastic insert.\n\nDespite these things, I am happy with the JavaPresse and look forward to its continued use (I use a medium-ish grind with a reusable K-cup...much success). I can recommend it to anyone looking to step up their enjoyment of coffee without spending excessively."

I have used an antique one but it was not easy to grind coffee beans even just for a single cup. This one is much easier and I can make 4-6 cups (2-3 mugs) of coffee every day. It's been six months since I got this so I have made 300 mugs of coffee and it still works perfectly. But it can be a little better--I hope the next version is shorter and fatter with a bigger handle."

I use it every morning when I make my coffee and it grinds those little beans down to little grains of sweet, sweet caffeine nectar that I need to wake my weary soul up. The grinder itself is high quality, well made and durable. I plan on passing this coffee grinder down to my children and my childrens children, and my childrens children children and so on. I believe the quality and durability will last for ages and what makes me happy is knowing that this coffee grinder will be around for centuries....that way the first thing my offspring will think of in the morning is ME as they grind their coffee beans with the very same coffee grinder that I used to grind my coffee beans...how unbelievable is that?? However, I am now realizing a problem with this coffee grinder....I have two children....when they get married and have children, what if they each have two children...then that will be a total of six of my offspring but only one JavaPresse Coffee grinder....will only one child inherit the coffee grinder....perhaps the eldest should inherit it...and give it to their eldest and so on....not sure how to tackle this problem. Hhhhmmmm....I think I'm just going to purchase 12 more manual coffee grinders from JavaPresse and use a different one every morning...that way everyone stays happy and the family does not get torn apart due to infighting over my very durable and long lasting coffee grinder made by the fabulous folks at JavaPresse!!"

So far I've made probably a dozen or so grinds and there don't appear to be any unusual wear with the product.\n\nOnly have 2 real complaints or objects of note with the product.\n\n1) It is possible to turn the adjustment knob at the bottom beyond fine. So if you're like me and you follow the instructions that say turn to the right until it stops. You will turn it way too fa. A better instruction would be \"turn to the right until it takes more force than previous turns\" or something of the sort. Once you figure that out it's all pretty straight forward.\n\n2) One side of the grinder could stand to be flat. When you remove the cup from the bottom there's no side of the grinder to lay it on. (The top has the penta rod for the handle and the bottom has the grinder). If you place it on it's side it wants to roll off the table.\n\nNumber 2 is a really minor thing. And number 1 is mostly me being inept. 5 stars. Would recommend."

I was grinding my coffee using an electric commercial burr grinder at a coffee shop, but that requires grinding the whole bag vs. freshly grinding per brew (which yields a tastier and more robust cup). I grind for French press, and after getting the proper grind setting, it ground consistently coarse beans for me. Best French press cup I've had! Thanks javaPresse!!\n\nNotes:\n- reasonably priced\n- quiet- just a crunchy sound of beans being ground and it's pretty cathartic\n- easier than I thought it would be to manually grind. Just tap the bottom lightly on the counter a few times to get the best outcome\n-Doesn't take up a lot of counter space, and easy to travel with if needed\n-easy to dismantle to clean\n- window is nice so you can view the grounds to make sure they're the right size\n-javapresse has helpful vids to maximize usage and maintenance\n\nOnly reason I gave four stars instead of five is because the hopper is kinda small (couldn't fit all 64g of beans at once), and it does take some time to grind, but anything great is worth the time and patience! :)"

In terms of consistency, I was very pleased. My electric blade grinder has always been very inconsistent in size, so this was refreshing. Its not a very large grinder so it seems like it would be good for travel/camping. It will hold plenty of beans to make at least 16oz of coffee. However, this contributes to my only complaint. The hopper open is very small, especially with the grinding mechanism sticking out of it, so its difficult to get beans into it without them going all over. The grind select seems to work fine but in order to get it set correctly, you have to close it all the way (Turkish grind) and then open it the specified number of clicks from there. On a coarse grind setting, it takes about 3 minutes to grind a full hopper at a moderate pace. But lets face it, if youre upset about the time/effort it takes to grind your beans, stop being cheap and get an electric grinder."

Although metal parts and burrs are very solid and well-made plastic parts are made of low quality plastic. Right out of box bumps on the bottom plastic part of the burr were wear off. therefore when you turn the adjustment nub cannot feel the click to adjust the grind.\n2. there are 2 identical plastic washers on top and bottom of the main shaft with a square key on one side of them. On the top, the square key fits in its place. but there is a circular hole at the bottom that makes the washer wobble in side it resulting to an unstable shaft.\n3. metal washer which holds the spring inside squeezes the plastic that holds conical burr which makes it wobble even more. (although you can fix this by putting the washer upside down that reduces the movement of ceramic burr inside the plastic holder.)\n4. After adjusting the lower burr to fine size to get a better consistency of grind, I realized the burr is still wobbling and also main shaft stands in an odd angle that makes upper and lower ceramic part contact on one side and have a gap between on the other side. this results in an inconsistent grind and reduces the life of ceramic burrs.\n5. On the fine adjustment, ground coffee goes between main shaft and plastic holder and makes it hard to take out the lower burr for cleaning.\n6. its hard to adjust the grinder. there is no indicator for adjustment. Especially if you like to switch between different brewing technics. (drip, french press, espresso, syphon).\n7. It takes about 7 to 10 min depending on the adjustment to grind a decent amount of coffee for 3 to 4 cup of coffee to enjoy with family. I know it's a manual grinder but still, it seems it takes for ever. Especially after a few minutes?, my hand starts hurting because of holding the grinder firmly in hand while turning the handle.\n\nI hope this review helps the company to realize their product weaknesses and customers to decide about buying this product."

It is slightly slippery at times, and obviously you need to be holding the top portion of the grinder when you are spinning the knob. If you are consistently using one type of beans, then it's fine, but if you are swapping between several types of beans and you do not want the flavors of the beans to mix, you have to take it apart and clean it. It is a minor inconvenience, but if you are swapping between beans frequently, it may become an annoyance. By the way, you have to replace it after a while when the ceramic grinding parts become worn out, and at the price it is selling, it isn't too expensive to replace.

            "reviewText": "To allow for context let me explain the role of the JavaPresse Manual Coffee Grinder in my life. I use this grinder predominantly for travel and work related coffee brewing and not so much for home use. I grind the beans specifically for French press style so I can't really comment too much on the finer grinds. I've been using this grinder most days for roughly two months and prior to this purchase I either purchased ground coffee or used an electric grinder (Cuisinart Grind Central). I personally give the product an overall 5 stars for my use of it but it overall gets a 4 star for quality. I will still breakdown some of the various characteristics because it is by no means a perfect product and some of the flaws may lean other users more towards a 3 or 5 star rating.\n\nProduct size\nPros: Compact with removable lever arm. Fits well in users stabilizing hand.\nCons: Chamber is only large enough for roughly 6-8 cups of brewed coffee (more or less depending on desired strength). Larger volumes will require multiple grinds.\nTake home: Ideal for grinding coffee for 1-2 people. Ideal for travel (camping, work, etc.).\n\nCoffee Grind\nPros: Easily adjust grind to desired coarseness. Grind remains consistent throughout each individual use (see below). Really satisfying \"crunch\" as the coffee beens are mechanically ground. Relatively quick grind for rough coarseness (about 2-3 minutes).\nCons: Time. I've only done fine coarseness twice and both times took upwards of 5-10 minutes. Occasionally at the end of grind the last coffee bean fragments will lodge in the grinder. When this happens continued turning of the lever arm will actually tighten grinding mechanism resulting in a finer grind. If product not cleaned or adjusted in-between uses you may result in finer than anticipated grind with next use. Product advertised as having an 18 click grind selection. Though this isn't totally inaccurate it is a bit misleading as the coarseness is based off how tight or loose the plastic nut is screwed on the base of the grinding mechanism. There is no \"clicking\" or visible marker for which setting you are at (1 through 18 I'd presume as advertised). Grind coarseness is very much a grind a little bit then check if the coarseness is right. Adjust and repeat until satisfied.\nTake home: Be ready for arm day if you are grinding for multiple people, making multiple brews, or enjoying a finer coarseness (Expresso drinkers). If you fall into this category you may want to consider an electric grinder. Ideal for French press. Should be cleaned and checked every few uses.\n\nValue\nPros: Can obtain a consistent coarseness that may be difficult to obtain with low and middle tier electric grinders that are of equal or greater price. Product seems structurally sound with no evidence of wear and tear as of yet.\nCons: None that I foresee at the time this was written.\nTake home: I would recommend this product for anyone pursuing rough coarseness consistency. Great value when compared to entry level electric grinders."

However, it's seems natural given its size that you would hold onto both the upper and lower parts just by gripping it, so I don't see this as a problem. Perhaps there could be threads on the body to screw the two parts together, but that would be a hindrance in my view as it would inevitably get clogged with coffee and be tough to unscrew, as well as increase the thickness of the walls of the cylinder; the weight of the grinder; the production cost and therefore price of the grinder.\n\nI have used this product every morning for over a week now and I can't imagine finding a better manual burr-mill for the price.\n\nIf you need to grind a large amount of coffee in a short time, this is probably not for you.\n\nHowever, if you want to hand grind enough fresh coffee to load up a 16oz French press, this is the ticket."

Dont get me wrong, I absolutely love this thing but what would make this a 10/10 is if they polished out a few spurs on the top cap by the handle. I know thats not an important factor but to see something that looks this premium and well built fall slightly off mark, pokes at me. The edges of the top cap were a bit sharp and almost Snagged me a few times, my fianc has actually gotten cut on it. I doubt that the sharpened edges are a normal post production thing seeing as others have given such great reviews, so Ill just chalk it down as it being just a slip during product inspection. Top cap aside, the overall build quality and design is just amazing. From the perfect ceramic teeth grinding the beans just right to the small sleek design that allows me to take it on camping trips with little to no loss in bag space, I love it, just had to sand down the rim of the top."

Or may be a little too early for AI to pay attention to a coffee bean grinder. Then JavaPress and this is MANUAL. Yes, it takes few minutes to grind, only 2-3 cups amount at a time, and you need to get used to, but I found myself enjoy doing this. The powder generated is very even, unlike electric blade generated. Aroma is great, very small amount of powder is left from the grinder and cleaning is easy. Electric blade one has substantial amount of powder stacked everywhere and feel \"mottainai\", etc. I really like it."

They yielded a cup of weak, tepid, tasteless coffee. So, back to the single cup fine grind coffee approach, in my gold filter. Will try this grinder for the fine grind, and compare it to the blade grinder. Since they both are likely to yield the same product, will probably choose twenty-five seconds over several minutes of manual cranking. Product simple and as advertised. Portable too."

I also have a hard time counting the clicks because mine only clicks about 4 times before it turns completely smoothly and it is a guessing game as to how many partial rotations is a click.\n\nOverall I think it definitely grinds very well but there are a few issues with usability.

After almost a year of use, however, I reassembled it after cleaning to find that it wasn't functioning. I reached out to JavaPresse customer service, who directed me to instructions on their website about reassembly, which was useful (there are small pieces and it's hard to remember which direction they go sometimes. My grinder, however, still wasn't working quite right--it would grind, but it would be a very uneven grind and beans were getting caught. I reached out to JavaPresse again, to see if maybe they could replace some of the inner pieces, and they offered to send me a completely new grinder for free! I am blown away by this, and I am very excited to have the same grinder again."

This is a generic Chinese knockoff of the Porlex grinder but it's nicely constructed and has worked well for me for two months of multi-daily use. Like all these hand grinders and many electric burr grinders, the grind size is not exactly uniform. The coarser you go, the more pronounced this becomes. I grind for pour-over and always find some bigger pieces at the top of the coffee bed although not to an unacceptable degree. There are grind no settings, you simply turn an internal nut until you get the grind you want but this is extremely easy to figure out. I find it takes about 140 cranks to grind 22 g of beans to medium fine for a 3.5 minute pour-over. This is slow work, fine for yourself but not a great solution for the whole fam. I've never filled the hopper to the top but I'd think it would max out at about 30 g. One nice thing, the hopper is basically airtight so you can weigh your beans out the night before. The removable handle fits a hex rod that protrudes from the top. This seems a bit janky but has not worn noticeably in two months. Anyway, when you compare the price of the grinder with the price of a couple of lattes, it's hard to see how you could go wrong."

            "reviewText": "Sturdy, easy to clean. Perfect for small households with limited kitchen storage space.\n\nGrinding just the right amount of fresh coffee by hand has become an enjoyable part of my morning. I love my old 4-cup percolator but it needs a coarser grind than my cheapo electric grinder can produce. Filling the chamber of the JavaPresse all the way up produces just the right amount of coarse-ground coffee for four strong cups of perked coffee. It takes about two minutes to grind and is not difficult. I'm glad I spent a bit extra for this brand and not a knock-off. It's very durable and I'm pleased I'll be able to buy replacement burr when necessary -- won't have to replace the whole unit.\n\nThe adjustment mechanism does indeed \"click\" when you turn it, but the levels are not marked. The manual suggests grinding a few beans and tightening or loosening as necessary. I found I quickly learned to _see_ the width of the opening that gives me the coarse grind I prefer, so I don't need trial and error every time.\n\nIf you like a fine grind I recommend starting with a coarse grind, tightening the mechanism, then regrinding. Otherwise it can be tiresome work.\n\nSome complain that it's hard to get the beans into the hopper without spilling. I just cup my hand around the top so it acts as a funnel and spoon the beans in with a tablespoon. Problem solved.\n\nBe sure to give the grinder a shake every few turns to move the beans around -- it makes the process faster."

I use to use a electric coffee grinder, but I soon realized that the grinds were very inconsistent, because I didn't the the high end one which seemed a bit to pricey for someone like me who isn't a coffee connoisseur. However, I do enjoy a great cup of coffee and this tool gets it done right the first time. Also you can change the different grind sizes by adjusting the knob under the grinder. This is accessible when you remove the bottom half of the grinder. I hope this review helped inform you enough to make a final decision. If you do decide to buy this, trust me when I say you won't be disappointed."

They responded back (within 24 hours) just to inform me that, no, they don't sell replacement parts, but they will be shipping me a whole new unit with expedited delivery. I truly cannot recommend this company enough. They have a great product and jaw-dropping customer service."

The fact that their \"replacement part\" is being sold on Amazon since 2016 and they KNOW this is an issue and yet they sell the product with the original weak burr is beyond me and insulting. Now I'm stuck with a decision I did not want to make 2 weeks after purchasing this product: Change it for another grinder or buy the replacement burr.\n\nNot a fun experience due to the unreliability but when it worked it was fine."

For some time, the fine grind worked really well on 'medium' setting, producing the right amount of pressure on the espresso machine & resulting in good amount of crema. But after about less than six month, we noticed the ground became less fine to the point where we had to tighten it to the tightest possible setting to ensure the same type of fine grind. We tried brush-cleaning the inside by opening up the grinder assembly to no avail. After about a year, it became clear that even on the finest grind setting (I can't tighten it further) the grind cannot be as fine as before. We noticed the pressure on the espresso machine became lower and lower, and the amount of crema became less and less."

The handle for grinding could be easily 4\" shorter as it is kind of an odd length for me, if it was shorter i feel i could do more revelations with less effort. Takes quite a bit to get the canister filled up. Like it, use it once and a while for single serve but would not recommend using it for anything bigger."

It's simple and easy to adjust the coarseness of the grind.\n\nThe Meh:\nIt's small, it will only grind enough for two cups of coffee for me using my Aeropress at a time. Which would normally be perfect except for:\n\nThe Bad:\nIt takes FOREVER to grind a small amount of coffee. Going at a constant and fairly rapid spin it takes me 8-10 minutes to fully grind all the beans that the top barrel will hold. I mean, if you want a small shoulder and upper arm workout while you wait to make your coffee at six AM when you need to be making breakfast for 3 kids, packing lunches, getting ready for school and work, cool. If you are that person, you should totally buy this. I don't have an extra HOUR in my week just to set aside for coffee grinding. It will also prob be great for folks with no time constraints who like a little zen in their day."

I put my water on to boil and have the beans ground and ready before the water is to temperature. JavaPresse Coffee Company has outstanding customer service!

My biggest issue is the grind. Everything people have told me is the key to a good cup is 1. Fresh grind, and 2. Consistent grains size. I attached a photo here so you can take a look, but to me, the grain size is all over the board. Some really small, some course, some medium course. I have done grinds on every setting (fine to corse) and for some reason, they all pop out about the same. On fine, the ratio of fine grounds is more, but there are still large chunks that make their way in. Just a heads up. Maybe my grinder is bad. I have no idea. But just a bit disappointed int he consistency of the grounds."

Perhaps it goes quicker if you're not after a fine grind but for me it was too much. Two shots worth took easily 5-7 minutes of non-stop cranking. That being said, the handle is a bit too long. It allows you to put plenty of torque to the grinder but means you can't go very fast (imagine making big circles with your arm). A shorter handle would still make grinding easy and allow you to go faster and possibly grind everything faster."

            "reviewText": "I love fresh ground coffee so I bought an electric burr grinder made by a big name company that retails for $50 and it broke within a year. It was too loud, too messy, and too cheaply made so I decided to go in a different direction with my next grinder. I looked online for a ceramic burr hand grinder and found a lot of them. They all looked the same, but I chose the JavaPresse manual coffee grinder. Out of the box, it was easy to use. Instructions were included, but for the most part, were unnecessary. It was easy to see where the beans go and where the grounds end up, but I did need the instructions to adjust the grind for my pour over. The grinder feels solid and the grinder worked well. I gave it four stars for convenience, price, and durability. Here are the reasons why I gave it only 4 stars.\n1) The grind adjustment requires knowing a little about how the grind should look. Since I have brewed a lot of coffee in many different ways, I know the difference between a french press grind and a pour over grind. If JavaPresse could tell us how many turns for each grind, it would help beginner coffee geeks.\n2) It takes a lot longer to hand grind coffee than you think. I ground 4 Tbs. of coffee for my first pour over and it took almost 5 minutes for a fine grind.\n3) I wish the top bolt that the handle attaches to was hexagonal shaped so I could use my cordless drill. I have a small lithium ion drill that would be perfect for powering my grinder, but the top bolt is a pentagon so there isn't a socket that will work. In fact, this is why fire hydrant caps have pentagonal shaped bolts. Unfortunately, this means I cannot use a power drill to save me time and energy. If I could have used my power drill to grind coffee with this grinder, I would give it 5 stars. I will be going to Ace Hardware to see if there is a sleeve I can attach to the pentagonal bolt that will allow me to use my drill.\n\nOther than these three weaknesses, this grinder is exactly as described. It is quiet, it seems durable, it is easy to use, it can be easily disassembled for cleaning if you want to grind things other than coffee, it is inexpensive compared to other grinders that can cost over a thousand dollars, and it arrived quickly."

The top and bottom parts slip together and although it is acceptable, they tend to move in your hand while grinding. If they screwed together to hold firmly together while grinding i would have rated 5 stars."

Great little machine, but after about 2 weeks you realize the need for an electric grinder. Also, I was taking it apart to clean and you have to be very careful. Inside there's a lot of little bolts and springs. When I loosed one thing, it shot off and I lost a piece down the sink. It still works, but I'm just glad I didn't loose something more important (I think it was a mini-washer??). Overall, great buy if you are starting out and don't know if you really need your own grinder. Some people might have no problem with hand cranking for 5 minutes.

It gives a fairly even grind on the coarse settings (I use a percolator, so the coarser the better) The ceramic burrs seem nice enough, and the lower one could be replaced if parts were offered.\n\nThe lid occasionally falls off and the handle regularly falls off though. The problem is that the handle needs to be easily removable to add more coffee, so any positive attachment would interfere with that. A spring loaded design similar to what's on the burr side of the shaft could be made to work, but it would eventually fail and would definitely make the grinder more expensive. The shaft is also a pentagon rather than the normal hexagon, so a standard wrench or nut driver can't be used (not that that would be a good idea anyway). If you lose the handle, you don't have many options for a replacement."

I have used the gadget about a month and it has worked flawlessly. I don't know how long it will last, but I know the battery will not need replacing and the motor will keep going as long as my arm muscles keep working. I have no idea why I am supposed to evaluate the unit's versatility. It grinds my coffee, period."

So I bought this hand grinder. It does a great job and the grind is easily adjustable, from finest to coarse. I get my morning exercise turning the (extra long) handle! It does a really great job of grinding beans and I know my coffee is always fresh and tasty. The grinder looks pretty elegant, too! Stainless steel, it will never rust. Love it!"

            "reviewText": "I will start off by saying I am not a coffee expert by any means. I am a beginner as far as coffee goes outside of a traditional coffee pot. I read like reviews on this item and though it would be at least worth trying for the money.\nWhen I received the grinder it was very well packaged and was not damaged at all. In the box was a thank you not as well as a link to some great videos on how to get started.\nThe company also sent me an email on how to get started and what to do when you first get it, which was extremely helpful considering I had never used one before. Once you put a few beans through to make sure there are no little bits of stuff in it, you're ready to go!\nYou couldn't ask for a better manual coffee grinder. It is very easy to crank, the set up is very simple, and the grind is consistent. The burr is very easy to adjust, so you can go from super fine espresso coffee to super coarse French press style coffee. There isn't much noise at all that comes from it, which is quite pleasant when I have two kids I try to not wake up on the weekends while making coffee.\nThe capacity isn't substantial but it is great for just a couple cups worth in a French press, which is my choice of brewing method. The grinder fits in my hand nicely, so it doesn't make it awkward trying to grind the beans.\nOverall I am very pleased with this coffee grinder. It is very affordable, quiet, consistent, and doesn't require anything but your choice of beans. I would recommend this item to anyone looking for something simple and easy!"

There are so many companies that make such a similar product, it's hard to figure out why one costs more than the other. I would put this product about on par with my Haro. The Haro has an indicator on the side of the grounds container, so you know when you've got enough for 1 or 2 cups. But after you use your grinder for awhile, you kind of figure out the right amount of beans without needing the indicator.\n\nI do find this grinder a little easier than the Haro when holding it in the air. In other words, the Haro seems to work more efficient when I hold it steady on the counter. Don't ask me why exactly."

This is a minor point, and Im not sure how helpful a click would be. I also found that operating the dial was not as intuitive as one would believe. My dial does not turn unless I press and hold the burr assembly inwardly against the spring. Once I press it in, I can rotate the dial. The video and instructions I reviewed said nothing about this.

These grinders are fine. They grind but very quickly tend to peel off the straight screw track of the adjustable grinder- it becomes tilted after grinding beans and the result is too much of an uneven grind with too many large chunks, even when I set it to a \"fine\" setting. This grinder will be added to the camping kit where I will keep it with an AeroPress, which it fits perfectly into the plunger. Summary: for the hand grinding time spent, too uneven a grind to be satisfactory as a daily coffee grinder. I used it for months before admitting this conclusion, becoming more unsatisfied with my coffee along the way."

I recently received a Flair Espresso Signature Pro and I've been experimenting with the Javapress to find that ideal grind. I've varied the amount of coffee beans from 15 g - 19 g and it takes more than 10 minutes to grind. The adjustment knob is backed out a few notches from closure in order to allow the ground coffee to fall through. But, if you want to grind coffee to medium or coarse consistency, then I think this will ideally work for you. Nonetheless, if you want a grinder you can take with you anywhere. Build quality is fine; just don't rotate the handle counter-clockwise otherwise you'll damage the ceramic burs."

The grind size is pretty consistent, with only the last little bit of beans coming out on the large size since they fall through the gap without any weight on top to hold them against the grinder. It is also somewhat noisy.\n\nI have two things that I think could be improved with this product. The first is that the bottom cannot be fastened to the top in any way - the bottom can fall off while you are grinding if you are not careful to hold on to it. You have to hold the top in order for it to grind, but you also have to hold part of the bottom. Perhaps if the top and bottom threaded together with just a few threads, this could be avoided. The second thing that could be better is some way to mark or provide reference to what number of clicks the grinder is currently set to. I have my numbers for pour over and french press written down, but if i lose track of the count or what setting the grinder was previously used for, I have to start over and reset it all the way to zero clicks."

I wanted something that could handle fine grinds as well as coarser grinds, depending on what I want to use to brew my coffee.\n\nThe JavaPresse grinder is relatively small in size (like a pepper grinder), with the handle being a separate piece. It can be broken down into smaller pieces easily if storage space is an issue.\n\nI tried testing out fine and coarse grinds, and they turned out pretty consistent. It's a good idea to go slow, as the handle merely slides onto the grinder shaft, and is not fastened on with a cap or nut. Make sure to only rotate the handle CLOCKWISE, as turning the other way will seriously damage the ceramic burrs.\n\nSo far, I have had no problems with this grinder. It works very well for grinding beans for a single-cup machine (like the Ninja ones). It feels sturdy and looks nice. Make sure to clean it out regularly and it will last a long time."

            "reviewText": "This is great if you only need to brew a couple cups for a French press. For a coarse grind it only takes a minute or two to grind up enough coffee for a couple cups, but on the finer settings you will be cranking that thing for a very long time. For expresso drinkers I would definitely recommend an electric grinder, unless you want a serious arm workout everyday before you've had your morning coffee. But if you use a French press like me, It's relatively quiet, only takes a minute or two, easy to clean, easy to adjust the settings, and definitely portable. My only complaint would be it's a little difficult at first trying to load the beans."

Besides my actual French press this is the one tool that has made the biggest difference in the quality of the coffee I brew. Also being manual, you don't have to endure loud mechanical noises in the morning before your first cup wakes you up."

After the initial panic about how to use it, I watched the videos they provide with purchase of the product and immediately understood how to use it. It took a couple of times to get the grind how I wanted, but after I figured that out, it was smooth sailing from there. I found that grinding coffee manually really makes a difference you can SMELL. It is light, easy to assemble, disassemble, and has a window so you can see how much you've ground. It doesn't even require that much strength to use, which is nice. The only draw back I've seen is sometimes the coffee beans get stuck and you have to shake it to get them to fall into place. Even so, it's really not that frustrating since the coffee it makes is so good. I've used it for pour over and french press, both types of grinds worked well. I highly recommend this to anyone who makes 1 or 2 cups in the morning.\n\nThat being said, don't buy this if you plan to serve your friends/family coffee all at the same time. Because you will spend 30 minutes grinding coffee (I had this happen)."

We tested out a few different settings using a couple beans each until we found the perfect consistency and then ground enough for a pour over. It was the most beautifully even grind I've ever seen and the coffee was delicious!\nHis favorite part is how he can adjust the grind so precisely to get the exact consistency he likes for the perfect pour over. We're also big campers and before he would have to measure out individual portions of ground coffee in ziplock bags and a few days in, the coffee would begin to lose its freshness.

There were always some beans left whole. Even though a few reviews said that the coarser grind on the Java presse wasn't as uniformed as the finer grinds, I felt it was worth a shot.\nI filled the hopper and started grinding away, (after a test grind as suggested). It took a little bit of time, but was very easy to use. The result was a very consistent coarse grind, with no unground beans. I was impressed. They have many videos out there to help you, which I did view. It seems to be very high quality and the packaging is very nice. I'm giving it 4 stars right now because I haven't officially used it. Only took it for a test ride. If it turns out to work as I'm hoping, I will update to 5 stars and already hoping to give as next year Christmas gifts."

The learning curve was shallow and easy to understand for adjusting the grind. It is also easy to take apart and put together.\n\nCons: There are several small pieces that would be easy to lose if not being careful during the washing process. The Handle can be a little hard to hold onto if you have larger hands.. I hope there is eventually a different style."

It was also not clear how to determine the starting point for counting clicks. I had to turn clockwise until I could turn no more, which was quite a bit of force, and I wondered if I was doing it correctly.

The end result is the grinder tightening itself and every time it happens the plastic gets deformed so it's more likely to happen again. I've used this grinder probably three times a week for four to five weeks and now I can't stand to use it anymore and will simply buy another Hario because that's lasted me several years with no problems."

It was very easy to grind and didn't make much noise.\n\nI have a Keuring that I use for coffee. It took 10 grams (2 Tbsp) of coffee beans for a 10 oz. cup of coffee. I use the Keuring reusable mesh filter with my own coffee instead of k-cups. I was very impressed with this grinder!"

It does not always make an audible click so you really have to remember how you have it set or go to one end or the other and start over trying to count your clicks. The grinding guide in the instructions is nice but does not directly correlate to how to set the grinder. Again, this is very minor and so far I am very happy with this purchase!"

After making several cups of coffee a day for a couple weeks, I took apart the mill and examined everything and gave it a thorough cleaning. There appear to be a few spots that still rub slightly on the stone, though it doesn't appear to be anything to worry about.

Makes it difficult to use for multiple applications and to experiment with minor variations with fineness in grind because you can't go back to a previous grind level.\n\nThe real killer was the time to grind beans for espresso.

One observation I have made is the slow grinding (relative to electric burr or blade grinders) doesn't heat up the beans losing flavor especially if you grind ahead of time. I am now enjoying black coffee for the first time (i.e., no cream or sugar)."

This is not the case. It worked fine the day after putting all the pieces back together. After another day the handle would just spin but the beans would not grind. There are other recent reviews indicating the same disappointing review, stopped working after 2-3 months of use.

No more buying pre-ground coffee and having the taste deteriorate over time. It's fresh, great tasting coffee for me every single day!"

You also have to make sure you have the right grind size set to fit what you are brewing.

The JavaPresse device is very well-made, compact and easy-to use (particularly with the wealth of material provided by the company.) The fineness of the ground coffee can be varied, and it appears to be quite uniform for any particular setting. The grinder is a bit limited in the amount of coffee that can be ground art one time; I've been grinding enough for a 12 oz. mug of coffee, and that seems to be close to the limit. (BTW, to grind that amount of beans takes me about 3-4 minutes.)"

Perfect size to grind enough beans for a cup or 2 of coffee for yourself and seems to produce a nice, even grind. Easy to disassemble for cleaning purposes. Perfect for your morning cup or would be great for travel, due to the small size. I think this is perfect for a single person (or even a couple) that don't need to make a large amount of ground beans or don't want to spend a large amount of money for a quality electric burr grinder. If you have never used a manual grinder, it is quite easy to use, does not require much effort, so don't be afraid of it. If you are getting good coffee, get whole beans and grind yourself as you use them! It does impact the taste! Very happy with my purchase."

So I decided to get over my fear of manual burr grinders, and I'm very happy I did and that I found this one! Easy to use, easy to take apart for cleaning. The window at the bottom where the coffee collects is very helpful. It allows you to grow smaller amounts at a time, so much less waste.

I also use a Chemex and it's nice to be able to quickly adjust the grind setting to whatever coarseness I prefer. Sure, some people will say it takes awhile to grind your coffee manually (about as long as it takes to heat up my water), but there are definitely benefits. For one, you get some buff forearms and better grip strength. And secondly, it's super quiet, which is nice when your making coffee before the sun is up.\nAll in all, JavaPresse makes a great product, and their customer service is fantastic!"

The grinds are VERY fine though. MUCH finer than any machine I've encountered...& I've done side by side comparisons."

I wish the handle had notch to slip into or an O-ring to hold it on while grinding. With these few things pointed out I will say its size does allow for it to be packed in my pack very nicely. It is easy to use and grinds very well. I would recommend this grinder to backpackers that take short hikes. Definitely not ultralight gear."

The clicking feature of the adjustment nut is very helpful to \"dial in\" the grind. It can be tricky to clean because the parts are small and you need to know how to reassemble it. I only wish that both washers were made of metal. But, the customer service is excellent and the shipping is fast! I bought my javapresse in December of 2017 and the washers broke two months later. And I think that was in part due to my ignorance (need to know the correct orientation of the washers). However, the lady was very sympathetic and they replaced my unit. I would suggest a small stiff brush to clean out the coffee from the grooves at the bottom of the collection compartment."

With the electric approach, the only way to get all of the beans ground is to go to the point where most of the coffee has been pulverized into a fine dust. Anything short of that and you have larger chunks and sometimes whole beans that remain unground. The manual approach involves manual labor, but it's well worth it. Each bean is ground to a level that you select and the entire batch is consistent. Plus this beauty breaks down for easy travel packing. If you are going to grind (and you should), this is the way to go. I've only had this a couple of days, so I can't speak to durability. Stay tuned"

For only two cups of coffee, there is almost 5 minutes worth of grinding (and that's holding the grinder at an angle and grinding and moving both arms as fast as reasonable). That's longer than it takes to make the coffee by any means, once the beans are ground."

It's also rather small so I can easily bring it with me on my many travels. It's stylish and I'm happy to leave it out in my newly renovated kitchen, it's adjustable to the exact kind of grind you want, but most importantly: it's quiet. Because who wants to hear a noisy angry machine first thing in the morning before you've had your first cup of coffee?"

It's easy to use and you can adjust the grinder to make it more coarse or fine.\n\nI can only give it 4 stars though because it is so small and takes about 3-5 minutes to grind about 2 tbsp of fine coffee.

Because it is tall and slender, it's easy to hold onto while your rotating the handle. When you separate the two halves to pour your grind, it doesn't spew coffee all over the place like my older plastic one did. Along with this grinder I purchased the Bialetti 6860 Preziosa Stainless Steel 3-Cup French Press Coffee Maker. And, I'm brewing an organic, fair trade, single-origin whole bean coffee from CoffeeAM.com.

I got two different emails from them--one prior to receiving the grinder as a check-in and what to do when I got it; and another to see if I was happy with the purchase. This is a great product and highly recommended for the user who doesn't mind some work in the morning to grind the beans."

            "reviewText": "This is a nice hand held grinder for the money. However, there are a couple of issues that are somewhat annoying. For one, you have to hold the top half and bottom half fairly tightly. If you don't, the two half will twist in the middle. The other issue is that the grinding process is very slow. I have a Hairo Mini Mill Slim coffee grinder as well. While grinding the same amount of coffee, the Hario completes the job in about half the time it takes for the JavaPresse. Other than these two issues, it does do a very nice grind with very consistent results."

The aeropress scoop fits right over the opening so I can just scoop up the beans, put the nut at the top right in the beans and flip the whole thing over to load."

I love the small footprint this leaves in the kitchen, and it's nice that you don't have to plug the grinder in. Much better than any blade grinder with regards to coffee dust creation. Significantly less dust with this mill."

I got this grinder about 1 year ago. Recently, though, one of the plastic pieces inside the grinder broke in two (split right down the middle). I reached out to JavaPresse and asked if I could buy a replacement part. They responded within a couple hours and asked for my shipping address to send me a brand new grinder!

Which I mean, I'm not mad about, I'm happy with the price and the quality. I got what I paid for. If I truly wanted a coffee grinder that would grind the coffee in different settings automatically, I would've spent the extra $50. Other than that, the product is great. I haven't had any issues so far and I got exactly what I paid for. I love it."

But I am only making 12oz of coffee at a time in a French press and this works great. Adjustable grind to get just the right grind, and stores in a drawer. My kitchen is tight on space, so I don't have room for a larger grinder, so this is great. Plus, since it is completely stainless steel, it travels well. Combine this with my small Stainless French Press, and you have a great travel duo."

My only 2 wishes is that there could be some grip built into the grinder - The smooth stainless steel spins in my hand if my skin is dry and its hard to get a solid grip on it (I put a sticker on it to help), and that there could be fewer small pieces to make it easier to dissasemble when you clean it."

My problem is that the hopper only holds 30g of beans-max, which means you can only get about 600-650ml of French Press. So you only get about 2/3 of a pot for each grind, or you have to grind more beans. I wanted something that would give me a greater yield per grind to have enough to serve others. Otherwise, this was a good grinder. It gave consistent, albeit small yield, grinds."

We usually make Turkish coffee, and the grinder does not grind as even or as fine as our previous grinder. Also the handle comes off way too easily - we cannot complete a grind without the handle slipping off multiple times. I understand that the handle must come off to insert more beans, but the design was similar to our previous grinder and we did not have the same problem. Overall the product gets the job done, but I believe there are other, cheaper options out there that are better than this one."

It took me slightly longer than expected to grind enough beans for a cup of coffee (maybe 3 minutes or so) but I'll probably get faster as I use it more. The results were fantastic! Great that you can adjust the setting to exactly what you want. It is so much better than my electric one and it's nice and quiet so I don't disturb anyone if I'm up early making coffee!"

I heard a lot of good things about JavaPresse burr grinder and decided to give it a try. Since i care about how amazing my coffee taste i pulled the triger and bought the grinder. I definitely do not regret buying one. Amazing product. Built very well of stainless steal and the best part the burr stone. Customer service is amazing and the product is outstanding. As a matter of fact i bought 2. Keep up the good work."

            "reviewText": "I purchased this to use with a recently purchased Espro coffee press. At first I was grinding the coffee beans too coarse and the coffee came out too tasting weak and was very light color after using the coffee press. After I adjusted the grinder so the coffee grounds come out smaller, the coffee came out tasting great. I am trying to transition to a coffee press instead of the Keurig because I want better tasting coffee. This coffee grinder works great and there are many instructional videos that helped me learn what to do and how to assemble and disassemble and clean it. The only other coffee grinder I've owned was an electric small Cuisinart."

Maybe it's the fact that I just feel \"cool\" hand-grinding my coffee beans, but I really can tell the difference in the flavor that you get compared to the electric grinder that I had for years. It's simple to take apart and clean, and it looks great on the counter, or it's small enough to store almost anywhere.\n\nI would highly recommend this Grinder to anyone that wants a reasonably priced and extremely functional grinder."

Second, the aluminum lid on top gets loose after repeated use and when the handle flies off the knob while grinding, the lid will fly off as well and the coffee beans scatter everywhere. To compensate, I have to use duct tape to keep the lid on, not an attractive solution.\n\nSorry, I won't buy another one when this one wears out but at least I know now what issues to be aware of for my next purchase.

            "reviewText": "3/12/2017: I originally gave this grinder 4 stars. I have reduced it to 3 based on current usage. I have been using this grinder for french press coffee and after sifting the grounds i have been able to get a pretty decent cup of coffee. I have been ok with this result even when i was losing about 20% of my ground coffee. It was worth it to get that perfect cup. I recently bought a hario v60 and based on other reviews, this grinder is supposed to work better with finer grinds. I used 4 clicks from all the way to the right just where the burs start turning (as soon as the burs can turn, that's my first click). At 4 clicks, I aim to have a salt like texture. I tried this, and for the specific recipe i was using, it the draw time was double the time i expected. Coffee was really bitter. I tried 6 clicks. Coffee was better but still a bit bitter. 6 is a bit too much though.. I use 10 clicks for my french press.\n\nToday I did a test to see how inconsistent the grind was and maybe if I sifted, i could improve my coffee taste. I figured, if i lost 20% of my ground coffee, it would be acceptable as it already was with my french press. The sifter I use is a tea infuser... it's a metal mesh and it works great. It passes everything except salt size particles. What's sifted feels really powdery. It was a bit disappointing to see that only 40% of my coffee was left after sifting. Losing 60% of my ground coffee is not acceptable.I either got a bad unit, or I am really picky about how my coffee tastes. Refer to the pictures.\n\nI took the grinder apart and noticed a lot of wobble and sometimes you can see the center cone is off center. I noticed that there may be a little part missing which I have emailed Java Presse about. The first time they responded, and sent a replacement grinder which I really appreciated and think it makes them a great company to work with. However, the replacement suffered from what i think it's a missing part. I emailed them about that and got no response. I'll keep testing the grinder a bit more and I will report on my progress.\n\n2/5/2017: I have had this manual grinder for a couple weeks now and I have been debating whether or not to write a review. There are a lot of things that I like about this grinder and a few things I don't which is why I just gave it 4 stars and not 5. However, after much reading about other grinders I am not sure if 4 stars is a fair rating and maybe I should give it a 5.\n\nFirst, I am not an expert on manual grinders or grinders at all for that matter. Prior to getting this grinder I had a blade grinder which I only had for a couple of weeks and probably used twice. I am not a big coffee drinker and I come from an instant coffee world... a few weeks back my wife asked me to get her some coffee which she really likes... so after reading I found out that the best coffee comes from grinding your own beans. I immediately started reading more and somehow I ended up buying the blade grinder... then I read some more and read that a drip coffee machine wouldn't cut it for the best coffee so I settled down with a French Press. I tried the blade grinder for a couple of times but the coffee was a bit inconsistent... after more reading I needed a burr grinder. After much research and since I was on a budget I decided to get this grinder. So the main reason to get this grinder was for my french press. I read a few reviews that this grinder was really good for a French Press.\n\nSo, after testing this grinder with my French Press I have the following likes and dislikes:\n\nLikes:\n\n1. Since I use it for French Press, the grinding time is not too long for about 30 grams of coffee. 30 grams even though I fill up the reservoir all the way to the top.\n2. The ground coffee seems very consistent from grind to grind, although not very consistent grinds (explained later as part of my dislikes)\n3. When I receive the product, I immediately got a lot of support either from the documentation in the packaging and links to videos on how to set it up, the different grinds, how to clean, disassemble and put it back together. I really liked this because you can immediately tell that the owners have put some thought into the product and their customers.\n4. The finish of the product is outstanding and it looks like it's going to last a long time.\n\nDislikes:\n\n1. Even though I can repeat the grinds from grind to grind... a single grind contains a lot of different size pieces, and even a lot of fines...Even though i dislike this from this product, I have read that even more expensive bur grinder suffer from the same issue... Unless I get a commercial bur grinder I may always have this problem with coarse grinds like the French Press. Initially I would grind at its coarsest setting of 18 clicks and then sieve the grinds with a regular household sieve (plastic) and it would remove about 14% of my ground coffee. The coffee was good. After reading some, I decided to grind at 15 clicks and sieve again... this time I ended up removing up to 25% of my ground coffee... this is why a full reservoir of coffee grounds only yielded 30 grams of coffee. The cup of coffee that I got though was the best cup of coffee I've gotten out all my entire setup (fresh coffee, just a few days from roast, french press, kettle with thermometer).\n2. I don't like that i have to sieve my coffee, but I've read that even the more expensive burr grinders suffer from this problem... so I don't know if I should fault this grinder for this or not. However, the reason why I gave the 4 stars instead of the 5 stars is because I think this problem could have been minimized if the burr mechanism would be a bit more steady... I have noticed that it wobbles a bit which is why I think why there are so many smaller grinds... maybe for the next generation some kind of fastener from the screw to the bottom of where the ground coffee goes could solve this issue.\n\nAgain, I am not an expert but I am very picky with the stuff I buy. Overall, I really like this manual grinder... and if in the future I buy another one, I may add a comparison review."

It works best as a dedicated grinder for on size of ground. I measure the amount of beans before putting them into the grinder so I have a consistent amount ground with no waste It does take a few minutes to get the coffee ground up but that is just the nature of doing it by hand.

For a grinder to cost over $20 AND require quite a bit of manual work, I would expect that the results would at least be stellar since I'm having to do all the labor. I'm not paying for the convenience, right? So I should be paying for a well-made product. That's supposed to be the trade-off. Well, my grinder arrived and I read the instructions. Tried adjusting the burr and IMMEDIATELY noticed that the burr spins on an oblong axis. I could not only hear the burr skip against itself on each revolution, but a visual inspection clearly showed the steel rod to be curved and not straight at all, which kind of defeats the purpose of the superior conical-shaped burr.\n\n\"It's ok\" I told myself, \"all the reviews said the customer service is excellent.\" And you know what? It is. Kudos to JavaPresse because they are very helpful and attentive and kind and everything I would ask for with customer care. They sent me a replacement promptly and asked me to follow up. However, the second grinder not only had the same problem, but it was even more pronounced than the original. I really mean no offense to JavaPresse because they were very kind to me, but there is a serious flaw in this product. I'm not going to exert manual labor into this process unless I'm getting a better result than the electric grinders which are only $15 more. I was hoping to get grounds quality like that of a $200+ automatic electric grinder. I returned the product and bought the next best electric conical burr grinder I could:Cuisinart CBM-18N Programmable Conical Burr MillYes, it's 3.5 times more, but for the convenience, and not to mention SUPERIOR results that I get with the STEEL burrs and consistent settings, I am so much happier to invest in this than to twist away with the JavaPresse. Yes, $80 was hard to swallow, but it's Cuisinart and I think it will be a good investment."

I then pulled the grinder out of the bubble wrap, pulled the grinder's three pieces apart, and found the burr that rotates broken into two pieces. I super- glued the burr back together, and reassembled the grinder, and it works great. I've only had it for less than twenty- four hours, but I have gone through almost an entire half pound of beans.

I haven't yet tried a very fine grind for my moka, but that'll happen soon enough. Intuitive to use. I'm thinking about sewing a travel pouch for it, so I don't lose the handle. The website is great; useful to learn how to take it apart for cleaning."

            "reviewText": "I bought this product thinking that it will grind my good quality coffee beans to a consist size, however, what I found is a grind that is not consist at all. When I grind a small portion (~20 gm) of coffee beans to medium fine grind, to use it for Aeropress or V60, I usually find large grounded pieces and somewhat fine coffee. Also, the process of grinding that small portion is very tiresome and takes a long time, because you can't speed up the rotation otherwise the coffee beans will keep jumping inside. I liked the quality of material used (stainless steel), and it's perfect size for traveling with Aeropress. But honestly, I wish that I went with more respected and known brand like Hario."

I washed the grinder and reassembled it twice per their youtube videos during that time period when I noticed the grind becoming uneven - with the size ranging from very coarse (about a quarter of a coffee bean half) to a medium coarse grind.\nI reached out to their customer support a month ago, but haven't heard back yet. If you care about grind consistency, I cannot recommend this grinder."

I'm so dissapointed with this purchase, I'm giving a 2 star review because in the end, it does the job (slowly, but it does)."

            "reviewText": "I'd have given this nice little grinder 5 stars if I could have it with a handle about 1/3 the length. Fine grinds take a while to spin which can be a bit exhausting with such a long handle. The resistance is light enough that a significantly shorter handle could be used requiring less arm movement and allowing for a faster spin. Maybe I'm crazy, though.\n\nOther than that, the grind is great and consistent with enough variation to get the perfect grind for your taste or brewing style."

You almost need a funnel which is what I have resorted to. I have spilled way too many beans trying to load this from a resealable 2 pound bag. Otherwise I like it a lot. It is small enough to take camping too. Keep in mind that this is a pretty small grinder so you won't be grinding too much at once. It can only handle 1 french press worth of beans at a time, which for me works. YMMV."

My problem was that I make 10 cups of coffee (drip) every morning, and that required two loadings of the grinder and a lot of hand cranking.
