I was concerned when I opened it because it doesn't appear to be a deep even though it advertised a \"large capacity\". However, I was very happy when grinding coffee for the first time. It handled the whole beans just fine, ground even faster than our previous model, and it was quite a bit quieter. I am glad this is the grinder we chose!"

I used a new toothbrush instead of the little cleaning brush with the grinder though. The price is quite good as well."

If you want coarse beans it only takes a few seconds, but it doesn't take much longer for a fine grind. Noise level is low and clean up is easy. Does not have an auto selection for the grind at least not on this model, but as fast as it works it doesn't really need one.\n10/4/2019 Update. Still working good."

It is a tiny workhorse and gets the coffee beans to the right consistency for use in a french press. I have used this to make a finer raw sugar powder and it also did the job. It is a tiny bit hard to clean, but without having too many detachable parts the only piece that can be completely washed in the dishwasher is the lid. So far wiping out the inside between uses is working all right."

It looks like a cheap plastic hunk of future junk, but it is so efficient at grinding coffee evenly and fine. I've never had such a fine ground coffee, and it's been great. Hope it continues to work. Will be back to update if and when it breaks down."

I think the less powerful motor on the Mueller along with the blade design and shape of the stainless container (bowl) all contribute the the Mueller's ability to produce a very consistent grind without to much fine powder resulting in much less bitterness. It is very easy to know when the grind is complete by just listening to the sound coming from the Mueller.\n\nWe make 12 cups of coffee each morning in a Cuisinart drip coffee maker which requires 5/8 cup of grounds for our taste. The Mueller makes it easy to grind this quantity of beans. When the grind is complete we simply turn the Mueller upside down and gently tap on the bottom side a couple times then, while inverted, remove the clear plastic lid and pour the ground coffee into the filter.\n\nWe could not be more pleased with a coffee bean grinder and highly recommend the Mueller."

I don't have anything to compare this to and I am solely rating this product on how well it suited my desire which was to grind coffee beans.\n\nGiven the disclaimer above, the product is very very good for what it is. It looks very unassuming but it gets the job done. In 9 seconds and a rather quiet manner, it grinds coffee beans evenly and neatly. Even better, the device is easy to clean without having to disassemble the whole thing at all. My advice would be to buy a small rag that you can dampen and re-use to avoid wasting paper towels. At the end of the day, it's a simple, no frills device that did what I wanted it to do: grind coffee beans & easy clean"

It gets it to the level I want in less than 10seconds, or in 2-3 pushes down, and for such a short time, I do not mind the noise, although to be fair it is not high. I tried it with pumpkin seeds, almonds and cashew nuts. Every time, I was happy with the result. I have not tried it for coffee beans but for the nuts it provides a very fine grind, so I think it would be good even for Turkish coffee. My previous grinder was a Tchibo made in Switzerland, which lasted for more than 20 years. Since I could not find the same grinder on Amazon or from any other seller, I was looking to buy one that was designed and produced in EU. This one is made in China, and I would have preferred it being made in EU, but still this grinder seem to be a good quality overall and so far I am glad with my choice. I like it also because it is white color. All American brands I could find on amazon were black. I do not know how long it will last, but for the price it is a good product."

In the description it indicates this coffee grinder can be used for items other than coffee beans, however as you will see the instruction manual clearly states that this should only be used for coffee beans.\n\nThat having been said, I used it for chia seeds anyway. For the price, I am honestly not too bothered if it does some kind of irreparable harm to my grinder - I wanted chia pudding and no grinder instruction manual was going to get in my way.\n\nI have now used this grinder with both chia seeds and coffee beans. I'm not a grinder aficionado and I don't need the fanciest product on the market. This grinder gets the job done and provides a nice fine grind, just what I was looking for. The motor sounds powerful, but is relatively quiet compared to other grinders I have used (it's still loud, but not AS loud)\n\nOverall I am pleased with my purchase, I have not had this product long so I cannot attest to how long it lasts but so far, so good. It's a good price and I think a better option than some others out there in the same price bracket."

            "reviewDate": "June 6, 2018",
            "reviewText": "Like the title says, this is a pretty basic coffee grinder, but it's solidly built and delivers good results. I'll be comparing it to the Mr Coffee IDS77-RB, since I've used that one for several years.\n\n-- Build: Good weight to it, the plastic is reasonably thick and doesn't feel as cheap like other grinders I've used (including the Mr Coffee). I get the impression this thing is going to hold up well. I'm not sure how well the white color is going to hold up to coffee stains though.\n\n-- Features: It has a removable lid that doubles as a cup and a on/off button. That's it. That said, basic guidelines are laid out in the directions, which are pretty well written. It may take you a couple batches to get an exact time down. The Mr Coffee grinder had more features like cups & coarseness settings, and a removable grind chamber that I wish this one had, but they're not a deal breaker. The power cord on this one is a generous 39\" (or 1 meter since it's Austrian) which is a lot more than any other coffee grinder I've had. The Mr Coffee has a frustratingly short cord, maybe 24\".\n\n-- Operation: The on button is a little stiff, but the grinder actually runs relatively quiet for what it is. My old Mr. Coffee grinder had a ear piercing note to it that was the last thing you'd want to hear in the morning. This one, not so bad. To empty it out, you have to turn over the entire grinder and then pull out the lid/cup.\n\n-- Grind: Grind is more even than any other blade style coffee grinder I've used, although it's still not as good as a burr grinder. It's also a lot cheaper than a burr grinder though. The coffee I made with it is pretty smooth, although not as strong as I'm used to. I think that's more down to me not having the grind time down yet.\n\nFull disclosure: I received a free sample of this product for evaluation; however, this review represents my honest opinion."

Additionally, coffee grinds easily get into the push button mechanism and cause it to get stuck and keep running even when your not pressing the button. It's incredibly loud. Very displeased with this and won't be purchasing anything from this manufacturer again."

When I put nuts in, it started, but quickly sputtered and even smoked, I heard a pop and that was that. I thought maybe it got stressed/heated but I started it again a few hours later and it would not turn on so it's throw it out time. So folks know I wasn't abusing it, I have had the $19.95 Krups basic grinder for a year and it's done absolutely well for me, but one of the plastic knobs went so I looked to improve on what I first purchased. I will say that this was cheap enough that returning it is almost probably not worth it, but still if you advertise it to do something it should not fail like it did."

I am hopeful that the sharpness of the blade and intricate cutting action may indicate that it is indeed Mueller time.\n\nThe wife decided that we were enough coffee addicts that is was time to start grinding our own beans. So she bought a hand crank thingee. My first morning back from a long and jet lagged trip abroad I stumbled downstairs and tried to brew myself something, but first I had to turn the handle on the thing like 100 times. It was long from there until I was up on Amazon looking at reviews of electric coffee grinders.\n\nThis one works well, is simple to use, and makes quick work of the beans. I am happy with it. The minus one-star is because it is noisy. I specifically read the reviews looking for one that was quiet (which was the wife's argument in favor of the hand crank, as we have sleeping kids in the house in the early morning). When I saw a mention in a review that this was quiet I hit the buy button. But I don't know what the \"quiet reviewer\" was listening to (or maybe had noise-cancelling earplugs on?). It is hard for me to see how anyone could view the Mueller's loud and high-pitched noise as anything other than noisy. So, caveat emptor. Otherwise seems like a great little made in Austria machine."

Great product and you can buy with confidence from this seller.\n\nUpdate: This is the 3rd time I\u2019ve used this grinder and it stopped working. The motor made a terrible sound and the blade was barely turning which seemed to stir the peppercorns more than grind. Bummer, I really liked this product, but back to Amazon it goes.\n\nWow! A coffee grinder has been on my Wish List for quite a while and I finally treated myself. I don\u2019t drink coffee, but want to grind spices for cooking. I also grind oats to add to my dog\u2019s shampoo for itchy skin. Nearly all basic coffee grinders I\u2019ve encountered look and function the same - steel inner bowl, small blade, clear lid with depresser button to begin the grind. This grinder is the same, but I will say it is MUCH quieter and seemingly a bit faster than others I\u2019ve used elsewhere. I appreciate that it is an Austrian product. The steel bowl seems to have a non-stick coating of sorts because the spices and oatmeal I have ground came right out with a few taps, rather needing to scoop and scrape. In the video you\u2019ll see how quickly the grinder turned rolled oats into oat flour for my dog\u2019s bath. I wasn\u2019t expecting it to get such a fine powder and was quite impressed with that. I\u2019ve also ground cumin seeds and peppercorns with great success, which elevated my cooking.\nI\u2019m really glad I treated myself and bought this coffee grinder!"

So when I needed coarse ground beans for the percolator, I would set the dial, turn on the machine, and when the hopper was full, my work was done, and I had perfectly ground beans, suited for my machine, with no effort. And no brain power.\n\nNot so with the Mueller. Coarseness (or fineness) of the coffee is determined by how long the user grinds the beans. So you have to learn by trial and error how long to grind your beans to suit your machine. The product comes with a printed guide, but I was disappointed. I\u2019m constantly pulsing then stopping to check the coarseness of the beans. Annoying.\n\nI gave it 5 stars for durability because I\u2019m an optimist. I\u2019ve owned it for about a month and it\u2019s still working. Let\u2019s hope it lasts a year. I\u2019ve gone through two leaky drip coffee makers in 18 months.

It doesn't have any way for you to get the grounds out without them going all over the counter and for some reason they seem to static cling to everything, it doesn't really hold a whole lot of beans to grind at once, and it is still pretty noisy.

It grinds coffee beans quickly and uniformly, about 10 seconds for one scoop of beans. It\u2019s not too loud, and you only have to grind for a few seconds anyway. For me, transferring the ground coffee into the coffee filter is a bit messy. Every time the top lid is is put on or off, fragments tend to go everywhere. Also, the coffee doesn\u2019t all just fall out when emptying into the filter, I have to wipe it out with my finger to get a pretty good amount of it to come out (probably due to static). Would probably be better if you used a small wooden basting brush for this. Again, I don\u2019t know if this is a problem for all grinders, but it is quite annoying in this unit. I\u2019ve taken to only using it on top of a dish towel by my coffee maker to mitigate the mess. One time when I was trying to see if I was using it wrong, I flipped the unit over and tried to use the clear top to transfer the coffee to my filter, using the top as a cup. I LIGHTLY tapped the clear plastic onto my plastic coffee filter and a small piece of the clear plastic chipped off. Fortunately it was just small enough that everything still works, but I wouldn\u2019t expect the plastic to be that cheaply made. Overall this grinder suits my needs but doesn\u2019t seem to be designed perfectly well"

I travel frequently. and I had a rather extensive trip planned to Thailand and China over the past 6 weeks. On my previous trip I brought a hand grinder. It became painfully obvious that this method takes way too long, especially for the amount of coffee I prepare . On the recent trip, I purchased the Mueller electric mill. My goal was to get the lightest, most compact grinder I could find since I would be packing it. I also had my Hario 4 cup dripper , filters, and lots of fresh roasted coffee beans.\nThe Muelller does a great job of grinding. Since I prepare pour over, it took some experimentation to get the grind right. If you just grind the beans in a normal fashion, for example, for 15-20 seconds, the coffee will be fine for espresso but too powdery for pour over. I ended up using a \"start - stop\" method in order to get exactly what I needed. I would grind sporadically for a few seconds, stop, and then grind some more. This way I was able to control the consistency and get it to where it needed to be.\nIn short, I ended up leaving it as a gift for one of my customers and I just ordered another one. You can't go wrong with this grinder."

Deducted 1 star because the prior Hamilton Beach grinder I bought at a store had a removable grinding chamber which makes it easier to empty and clean out, this is one piece and you have to tip the entire grinder upside down to empty it into the top. Also, the HB one had a pop out storage place for the cord to wrap up inside it. However, the HB one after years of use actually exploded on me while I was grinding beans and shaking it, and appears to have been because the cord that you wrap and store around it after years of doing that, was compromised. So I was actually relieved to know this one does not have that cord-storage feature. Knowing what I know now, I would buy this Mueller grinder again and again, especially at this price."

I typically need to grind a full dose, followed by a 1/4 dose of beans. It typically takes a little longer for grinding than you think it should, and you will need to get good at pulsing, shaking and tapping ... but no biggie. Bottom-line: the metal grinder bowl is too short and the lid an awkward fit ... the whole process requires more clean-up and attention than anyone really wants to give early in the morning.

The bottom was not fully attached which offset everything else and created a gap between the plastic cover and the bed of the grinder where the beans are placed allowing the grinds to get everywhere.\n\nI unscrewed the bottom so I could shove everything back in place and noticed the electrical cord tied in a knot to keep it from coming through the plastic the case. I make lamps for a living and know that this is NOT UL certifiable. Additionally, the knot in the cord obstructed the bottom of the device, which offset everything else.\n\nUltimately, this is super cheap grinder made in china and branded with Austria to make consumers think otherwise. Don't waste your money."

However, it is not our favorite grinder as there is no easy way to measure how much comes out of the grind which we were use to. A marker on the grinder top could be useful. The grind size is based on how long you push the button so somewhat a trial-and-error every time you try a new brand of beans or if you make your coffee using different machines (filter, french press, chemex, etc). Good value for the price though."

I was worried about a grinder sounding like a blender, but this is easy on the ears.\nGrinding 2-3 scoops of beans is easy and takes 12-15 seconds. The grind is consistent. My only issue is cleaning the grinder near the blades. It says to not imerge into water which makes clean up a little annoying.\n\nFor this price point, this grinder is perfect."

As soon as I took the canister out and sat it on the counter, I noticed that it was sitting lopsided. Took a look at the bottom and found that the perforated bottom was pointed outwards as if the canister was dented from the inside. I've attached the picture to better illustrate the image. I'm a little bummed out and will be shipping the product back, still contemplating if i really want to give it another try or look for something else."

We're talking some of the beans reduced to fine powder while others are still in halves or quarters. This is fine for cheap drip coffee makers (how I usually make coffee these days) but if you are wanting to do any sort of pour over, aeropress, espresso, etc, this grinder will be a big let down. If I want to do those things I use my manual grinder, which produces a completely uniform grind.\n\nThe grinder is mostly made of plastic which apparently is possessed of a vicious static cling. This means it's basically impossible to get the thing clean by wiping it down with a dry cloth. You can get it to a satisfactory state of clean but it takes longer than it should.\n\nThey're giving away veggie peelers in exchange for reviews, which probably explains all of the positive press here. I don't need a veggie peeler so I'm writing an honest review.\n\nIt's solidly built and very easy to use. It's not a horrible coffee grinder. It's just not a particularly good one.

I would say the layer is about 1/16\" thick. It's not a huge deal but this is something I never had to do with the Cuisinart. If someone has suggestions on something that's food safe that I could apply to the surface to keep it from sticking, I would certainly appreciate it."

I'm glad I plugged it in and turned it on before pouring in some of my expensive beans that would then have had metal shavings in them. The noise when I first turned it on was frightening, as the blade started cutting a groove into the side of the stainless bowl. What a disappointment this thing was. Also, don't let the advertising about how much better a job it does grinding beans than the other similar coffee grinders. NOT! One look into the top of this thing shows that other than the cutter being off-center, it looks EXACTLY like every other coffee grinder out there. The blade and even the plastic nut that holds it down look exactly like the 10-year-old Mr. Coffee grinder I gave to my neighbor in anticipation of having a nice new one. Also, none of these blade \"grinders\" actually grind anything. They chop. Like food processors, they chop, not grind. They only use the word \"grinder\" because it is more acceptable than saying \"coffee chopper.\" Bottom line, believe the other reviews: this thing is a poorly-assembled, substandard version of the everyday, ordinary cheap coffee \"grinders\" out there. Buy one made in China; at least they have decent quality control."

The RPM may be higher and is a well balanced machine. 4. Thanks for offering in white..\n\nBut I have to add this:\nAfter testing this one for a month or two I got the old Starbucks out. There's something about Mueller's metal cup that mounts the blades - despite cleaning with isopropyl alcohol it started to attract grounds that had to be brushed out each time. The blade hub was also affected. Further, the fine grind of which it's capable end up on the counter as well as the housing and inside the lid. More brushing req'd. Were I factory manager of the Muller I'd be proud to inspect the unit - it looks great. Using it daily's a different matter.\n\nThe Starbucks grinder's made in Slovenia - its metal cup seems to repel grounds - but maybe its\nthe coffee I use - Safeway Signature Kona (10%) Whole Bean - Medium Roast."

I wasn't using the fancier features of the DBM-8 (always had it set to the same fineness, pretty much always used the same small amount of beans) and the DBM-8 was bulky, difficult to clean, took up a lot of countertop space, didn't have a real burr in it, and encouraged you to leave beans out in the hopper. The Mueller is inexpensive, smaller, much lighter, and WAY quieter. Small size means it is easy to stow in a cabinet when not using. Not to mention that it is quick and easy to clean - just use a small brush in the grinder part and rinse out the plastic cap in the sink - no more disassembling the product to get at hidden areas with built-up ultra-fine coffee bean grounds (I hope). Because it is a \"blade\" grinder (FYI: the blades are dull, no risk of cutting yourself), you don't have much control over the grind size. Theoretically, you could make coarse grinds by 'pulsing' the beans for 2-3 seconds at a time, but I found this left some beans whole. It does do a pretty consistent medium/fine grind suitable for any standard drip coffee maker by just holding down the button for 10-15 seconds (time depends on quantity of beans), and it is much quieter than the DBM-8."

So far it's a great buy and a great replacement for an old Braun I had that finally died. As far as the noise level goes, you need a strong powerful motor to do the job, and as a result it will make a lot of noise in the process. What do you expect? My dogs weren't afraid of it after finishing the first cup of beans, didn't overheat or catch fire like Lithium Ion cell batteries can, so it passes all of my important tests."

            "reviewText": "We first used this little grinder at a vacation house on the beach, when we accidentally bought beans instead of ground coffee. The owners of the house had stocked it well and we just loved this little machine. The fact that it is so quiet was our first delight. We have a high end coffee mill, but it is not quiet at all, so this was a nice surprise. The second thing we loved was that it ground our coffee beans into a very fine Turkish grind in no time at all, and, did not get hot and overworked like so many small grinders do. We immediately went online to find it on Amazon and found that the price was excellent. We are so happy with it that our over priced big grinder has gone into storage. This little machine does it all. I can't wait to try it on nuts for cooking. We highly recommend this little gem! Sellers were great as well. It came in two days and was packed well for shipping."

            "reviewText": "I really dislike the design of this grinder. The way the lid opens creates a small suction so when you open the top you will always leave behind some grinds on the counter. I like when the entire top is removable not just the lid. Because the entire top does not come detatched you have to grab the entire grinder and up-end it into your coffee maker. This makes the process really cumbersome and I now after grinding, I end up just turn the grinder upside down, give it a pound or two on the counter and remove the lid. That way I can just tap the lid filled with coffee grounds into my coffee maker instead of my entire grinder. Other than that the noise level is fine and the motor is very powerful. I always get the ground I want which is a fine grind. Three stars for the wonderful motor but minus 2 for terrible design."

Like I mentioned, you just put however many beans you want in the grinder and then snap on the plastic lid. There is a gray mechanism attached to the plastic lid that you press down to start grinding. You have to hold down the mechanism to grind so you have a lot of control over the coarseness of your grind. It is pretty compact at about 7 inches of height and maybe 3 inches of width so it won't take up much kitchen space."

I found the Mueller coffee grinder on Amazon, read the reviews and decided to give it a try. We love it! It grinds a large (10-12 cup) pot of beans in a single grind. It is amazingly quiet; so much quieter than our coffee pot grinder at home. It is aesthetically very attractive sitting on the counter. My only complaint is that I cannot wash the base in soap and water which is understandable because of the motor; it just makes it slightly more difficult to clean. I am very happy with my purchase of the Mueller Coffee Grinder and absolutely recommend it!"

You always end up with extra or need to blend twice. Both wasting time. I use this machine now for my cold brew attemps because the coffee amount is less strict.\n\nUsing it so much has made me feel its quite annoying to turn upside down to get the beans out. Again, if it were a solo use its fine but you need to grind, lid off, invert machine, then scrape / clean the excess beans. Its not as straight forward and comfortable as more expensive machines would be.\n\nI do like this product, and would buy it for my friends and family, but I think it doesnt suit my specific need."

The noise level is surprisingly not bad. Our previous one had such a high pitched noise, it hurt my ears. I haven't needed to clean our grinder since we only use it for coffee. It is small enough that we can take it with us on vacations, too!!!"

It does a great job grinding the beans and after an initial clatter isn't too loud at all. My one complaint is that it's a bit of a challenge to clean well. In addition to working with the blade the metal bowl at the base only goes up about halfway on the sides, creating a seam between it and the plastic before the plastic then meets the cap. Instead of using a \"damp cloth\" as recommended, I've been using a cheap toothbrush to ensure I'm getting as much of the last batch out as possible. It's not optimal, but it does pass the time while waiting for my freshly ground coffee to steep."

While it is good, it was bought as a gift for me and I was ready for a change. I am so glad I did and decided on the Mueller HyperGrind.\nI can say without a doubt this is a fantastic product. It has powerful blades that make short work of the beans put inside. It arrived promptly and after unboxing, was incredibly simple to use and I was able to have a fresh cup of coffee in minutes. The Mueller is a fast, powerful and surprisingly quiet grinder and is very easy to use. I will be recommending this product to anyone who is in the market for a quality coffee grinder with incredible value. This product earns every bit of its 5-star rating."

I used it twice with no issues. It died for him first try in front of co-workers basically still brand new.\n\nThe vendor contacted me on Facebook and asked me to message them Feedback on my experience for a free item and I messaged them on Facebook (copied what I had already reviewed on Amazon).\n\nTHEN\n\nThe Vendor asked me to please review on Amazon and I let them know I had already posted my review.\n\nActually did get the small free gift from then (delicate potato grinder) however while they did not say give me a great review or no free gift I can see how that applies pressure on some individuals.\n\nFor me? I had no idea about what the free gift was but I was interested in their practices and they look legit but I would be dubious about some positive reviews. Some people would do anything for a freebie."
