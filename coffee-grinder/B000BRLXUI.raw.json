            "reviewText": "I almost didn't get this due to reviews citing horrible chemical smells, but took the dive and I'm quite pleased.\n\nAt least in my case, it turned out to be the typical electric-motor smell from lubricants that you find in many a mechanized appliance, albeit somewhat pungent. Further, it comes from the base of the device, which is well apart from your precious grounds; you can make a case for oils getting on the outside of the grinding chamber in a worst case, but I don't see them ever get inside and contaminate the grounds.\n\nAll 3 settings delivered the desired consistency in relative quick time.\n\nCleanup was fairly easy with a little improvisation: the chambermaid system requires you to turn the lid a few times to activate- a friction-inducing action which I imagine would test the seal./locking mechanism over time. I simply removed the lid and manually pushed the chambermaid around with a finger before shaking the grounds out and washing components by hand.\n\nThis would be a clear 5 star review, but for the slight odor (which really wasn't much of an issue to me) and the puzzling fact that use in accordance with manufacturer specifications may actually wear the product down faster. It is recommended for the grinder on a budget, who's willing to cope with slight imperfections.\n\nI will be sure to update if anything changes for better or worse.\n\nUpdate March 13, 2019:\n\nHow time flies! +1 year of nearly daily use & it works as well as it did on day 1. Chemical odor is gone & the chambermaid and I maintain a very cordial relationship."

The mechanism allows you to choose how many cups of coffee you will make, tells you how many TB of whole beans to put in the grinder, and has a setting for the type of grind desired. Then, with the settings chosen, it automatically grinds the beans for the right amount of time. Easy to clean, and easy to use. Couldn't be easier!."

            "reviewText": "I just purchased this Mr. Coffee 12 Cup Electric Coffee Grinder to replace a more expensive famous brand model that held the coffee beans in a container at the top, and ground them into a container at the bottom. After just a few years of occasional use, it stopped working. I felt I had wasted over $50 for this name brand coffee maker I had. Then I tried using my Ninja all purpose grinder, but it didn't grind the beans down enough, plus what was ground, got stuck in the top, making it hard to remove and re-attach the top, as the grounds would get caught in any nook and cranny the lid and container had. So, I decided to look for a cheaper coffee grinder, and I found the Mr. Coffee grinder had a lot of positive reviews, and was relatively inexpensive, so I purchased it.\n\nAfter washing the container that holds and grinds the beans and the top, I placed the beans to the fill line, and ground my Tim Horton's coffee beans finely ground. It worked like a charm!! The container has side scrapers to prevent coffee grinds to build up and cake on the bottom and sides of the clear container. This was a good purchase for me at an economical price!\n\nYou should know that if the clear plastic container is not placed back onto the base the correct way, the grinder will not work. I thought the grinder was defective at first, until I realized it was \"operator error\" by not reading the directions first. Once I had the container placed back on the base and locked in place. the grinder worked flawlessly. You should also know that there is no \"on and Off\" button. You need to select the amount of coffee you want to grind up to 12 cups and choose how you would like your coffee ground. Once you choose that from the side of the base, you simply push the \"on\" button on the top of the clear bean holder container until your grinder stops on its own. If you do not hold down the \"on\" button, your grinder will stop. That is a built in safety feature.\n\nThe cord is approximately 2' long. Also, when I'm done grinding, I unplug the grinder just so there's not any electricity running through it."

The product arrived promptly and was packaged securely and had no damage to outer package or product package. I am going to enjoy using this grinder. The instruction booklet explains the different parts of the grinder and how to use it. I made my first pot of coffee this morning. It tastes so smooth and delicious compared to my old automatic drip coffee maker. Two observations: On the product box it is stated that you can use this grinder for spices; however, in the instruction book it clearly states not to use it for that purpose. That might make a difference to you if you intend to grind spices. Also I wish there were some way for your setting to default to your setting once it is unplugged. For example, if you unplug the grinder your setting must be reset every time. There is a setting for fine, medium or coarse grind and an automatic stop when that consistency is achieved. You may have to hit the grind button an extra time to get all beans. I ground 4 Tbsp of beans on coarse and had to hit it twice to catch all the beans. The cord seems short but actually is long enough for counter use as the cord is wrapped around the inside of the base. I would recommend this grinder especially b/c of the grind selection.Mr. Coffee IDS77 Electric Coffee Blade Grinder with Chamber Maid Cleaning System, Black"

Seriously? This grinder has issues. The design isn't bad, even though there is a lot of plastic. If you set it on Course Grind, it grinds it but leaves way too many large pieces (even for French Press) and has a mix of fine and medium all together! Okay then, so I set it on medium, funny the grind looks the same as the one prior, maybe a hint of more fine, but look there's the big pieces too.... I even got a little theatrical with it shaking and grinding at the same time, hoping that would help.... Nope, still the same. Espresso? Not much better. It also says not to put nuts or seeds in this, so sad, Mr. Coffee use to produce good things. I could create a better grind of coffee with a Ziploc bag, a hammer and a cutting board."

            "reviewText": "This is supposed to be an automatic coffee grinder. It has settings for grind coarseness and # cups. Just what I wanted. That should mean you set those 2 things, press start, and let it go. However, it is not automatic. You have to hold the button down the entire time for it to grind. So what the heck do the settings do? Nothing. You still have to stand there and hold the button. If you have to hold the button down, might as well get one of the simple basic blade grinders that's at least easy to clean.\n\nOn top of that, it is difficult to clean. The \"chamber maid\" system does nothing but trap grounds and get in the way. Can't get them out even with a coffee brush. You're supposed to wash/rinse the chamber and lid, but because of their design, water gets trapped in both the chamber and lid, and you can't get it out or hand dry it. Have to wait for it to air dry. So, if you want to grind coffee 2 days in a row, you can't rinse out the chamber/lid in between! You just have to have messy grounds spilling out all over the place until you have time to rinse it and let it air dry for 36 hours!\n\nBut the worst thing is it doesn't grind well at all (at least, the one I was shipped doesn't; maybe it's defective, but the other issues are still true). Half the beans are pulverized into a fine powder and the other half are left essentially whole. After multiple attempts, could not get an even and complete grind no matter what we did.\n\nNo wonder this thing is inexpensive--everything about it is bad. I bought it because it supposedly had the features I wanted, not because of price. I bought this to replace an old GE automatic blade grinder that let you set the grind/# cups, press start and walk away. Worked great for years. And even had a very easy cord-retraction/storage system. Unfortunately, I broke the lid lock switch, couldn't super-glue it back, and I can't find that same model of grinder anymore.\n\nAm returning this one."

I like to be able to dump grounds directly from the grinder bowl into the coffee filter in the coffee maker, but quite a lot of the grounds get stuck in the bottom of the grinder, making it very difficult or impossible to dump them without making a huge mess, not to mention wasting coffee because of how much gets stuck in the bottom of the grinder. I don't expect perfectly even grinding either, but I found myself over-grinding my coffee too finely in an attempt to get the large chunks of bean to grind down also, which didn't work. And forget about using a brush to clean this thing out--the coffee gets stuck at the bottom and inside of the plastic stir strips and won't come out when brushed (it just re-sticks over and over, even when you tip it upside down), so the only way to clean it is with soap and water, which isn't something I want to do every single time I use the grinder.

These are two areas where I expected some of the plastic to quickly get broken, but so far so good!\n\nWe have set it to one setting that we know is perfect for our amount of beans and never change it, and only ever used it for coffee beans, so can't speak to versatility of materials or variance."

However, we have ground coffee for usein the coffee pot and that worked great.\n\nMy partner and I are both blind, so we needed some help to know how the buttons would work when we press them. We learn from the manual that when you plug the unit in, the settings are automatically set to 8 cups for medium ground. Top button is to adjust cups, and the bottom button is to adjust the coarseness of the grind. Pressing the bottom button once will change the grinder from medium to coarse; pressing it again will change it to fine grind. Pressing it one final time will bring back to a medium grind.\n\nSame idea works with the top button. If you press it once, itll change to 10 cups, then 12, then to 4 cups, then to six, then back to eight cups.\n\nThe manual provide some information about cleaning as well. To top section do you unscrew and can be washed. The bottom section attached to the cord should not be submerged in water and doesnt think you need to be washed at all. The manual is pretty easy to read using Seeing AI app on our phone. I imagine it would also scan while using a scanner. Imagine you could also probably search for one online. If other folks have any other helpful instructions on use for cleaning of the product, dont hesitate to chime in."

I have to say, I absolutely love it, and I wish I had switched to grinding fresh in the mornings a long time ago.\n\nThe grinder itself is compact, which is nice; it stores easily, and the individual components come apart very easily for washing. The number of settings it contains is also great. I love that I can set the coarseness of the grind depending on whether I want drip or espresso, and how many cups I'm looking to make. I've also used it as a spice grinder, and I find that it is super handy for that, as well. I have used it to grind roasted cumin seeds, and while it took a little extra washing to make sure my coffee beans didn't taste vaguely like spice, it worked very well.\n\nThe only caveat: It's noisy. I grind my coffee fresh in the morning now, and the noise makes my cats very upset and is guaranteed to wake my partner if she isn't already up and about. Other than that, I have no complaints. I've been using this for a few weeks now and it seems to still be in excellent condition, but I'll be sure to update if it breaks or something happens to it."

The grinding cup has plastic struts along the inside of the walls that are meant to help remove the grounds. They actually TRAP grounds, thereby creating waste in the form of unused coffee grounds, and necessitating more effort than other grinders to remove the grounds into your coffee maker. It also takes longer to clean, thereby sucking more time way\n3. Those same struts are made from flimsy plastic, and I was always afraid I was going to snap one while cleaning. Since they are part of the mechanism that secures the lid for operation, that in itself would have rendered the device inoperable of it had happened.\n4. The lid is an over-engineered collection of plastic hinged together to provide maximum frustration. It traps grounds, making it a pain clean, the hinge itself is just a think piece of plastic just asking to be snapped (and once it goes, so does functionality), and securing it to the base/cup to operate the thing requires way more practice and finesse than most people have the capacity for while trying to make coffee.\n\nThis is not a well designed product.

You have to set grind and number of cups each time you use it. I guess if it was left plugged in that would not be an issue, but I keep mine in the cabinet and not on the countertop. The other problem is the ridges on the inside of the basket. It is difficult to brush out and get a clean sweep because they trap grounds on the ribs. Overall I am satisfied with this product."

In fact, I need to grind each batch about 3 times, stirring in between to get a passable result. But it's small, cheap and it's fine for occasional use. It's not objectively good- but that's not what you expected at this price. The value is decent, and it's a good choice if you mostly buy pre-ground, or want something to leave in the office, rental or vacation home."

            "reviewText": "I originally purchased this grinder in 2011 and it lasted until recently when the black plastic stirring part broke. It has been a dependable coffee grinder with daily use. I make an 8-cup pot of coffee everyday using 64g of fresh coffee beans. I use the shortest setting, i.e. 4 cups, coarse grind. Any more grinding and it starts bringing out some bitterness. If you want your coffee stronger by all means grind longer, however, if you want to avoid \"burning\" the beans, then I would suggest pulsating the beans to a finer grind. This keeps the heat down and avoids scorching the beans. For under $20, you can't go wrong with this grinder."

            "reviewText": "This little item does a creditable job grinding up coffee beans and the price makes even a better buy. I'll tell you why: In the last two years, I have bought two different brands of relatively expensive ($35 to $55) \"burr grinder\" coffee mills, each of which failed before the year was up. The Mr. Coffee grinder cost me $11 and does pretty much as good a job as the other two, though there is the occasional unground bean and grinding 12cups on the \"extra-fine\" setting asks a lot of it. But the way I look at it is this: I don't use \"extra fine\" grind but occasionally and, even if this gizmo fails within a year, I've only invested $11 and can replace it for $11 not $35, $45, $55--or up--as with the others. The Mr. Coffee grinder is easy/intuitive to use, doesn't take long to complete its task. cleans up easily, and doesn't take up much space on my kitchen counter (unlike the other coffee mills). All things considered, for my purposes, this item is the best buy."

Mine is permanently stained because of this and an eyesore in my kitchen. Also, for anyone hoping to use it more than once a day, or even once a day, it takes almost a full 24 hours for this to dry completely so you don't have water shooting out of the grinder assembly as it spins in the base. I would not buy this one again. But for now, it works, so I guess it stays."

But you still have to hold your finger on the button the entire time it grinds.

They kind of get stuck atop the ground beans below unless you shake it around or something. You cant really adjust the grind either, just the amount of time the motor spins based on how many cups you plan to brew. Its a cheaper unit, Im not really surprised at its performance, just disappointed because I know Ill need to spend more money to get a more reliable grinder."

This morning while cleaning the grind chamber I took the blades out and discovered they are not sharpened at all.

The Brother's blades are still pretty sharp after 20 years, while the Mr Coffee's blades have no sharp edge at all.

He still complains because occasionally a bean or two doesn't get ground up all the way by this grinder, but overall he likes it. He has a few other complaints about this grinder but they all have to do with my mom washing washing the lid the wrong way or that he doesn't know which level of courseness he's supposed to grind at (even though he grinds his coffee daily now) but there's nothing Mr. Coffee could have done about those things so I still say 5 stars."

The lid is also detachable from the grinder/blade bowl. This is a must, for cleaning and ease of emptying the ground coffee into the filter. I also like the fact that I can make the beans ground as fine as I would like. I believe, the finer you grind the beans, the more flavor you get out of the beans. The motor is also powerful and will not bog down with the amount of beans you grind and the fineness of the coffee grounds.\nThe only negative thing is that the motor is loud."

            "reviewText": "I purchased this little guy a few weeks ago for one reason - to make espresso. We (wife and I) don't own one of those super-fancy or expensive espresso machines. We bought themypressi TWIST Handheld Espresso Makerthis past Christmas (gift to ourselves) and have been usingCoffee Bean Direct's Italian Roast Espressofor a few months with our grind and brew coffee maker. We figured this is good enough for the casual espresso that we want on the weekends. We didn't have a grinder though, so we went to our local S-bucks and bought a pound and had them grind it. If you've bought from S-bucks, you know how much a pound of coffee is and we didn't want to keep making separate purchases, so I looked for a cheap grinder. Now before you knock me for what I am using this grinder for, I am aware that the burr grinders are \"best\" for espresso, but given that I didn't even pay half of what Amazon (and other retailers) is selling my espresso maker for, I was not about to spend close to $100 for a grinder. So, about the grinder...\n\nThis grinder is pretty much what you expect it to be. It is compact, gets a little warm when I run it, and is a little on the loud side. As a matter of fact, most grinders are on the loud side, so that shouldn't be a surprise or a draw-back. The settings are about as basic as you can get - fine, medium and coarse. And depending on the amount you want to grind (settings from 4 cups to 12 cups and has tbsp equivalents for each cup measurement), the built-in timer does ensure that you won't over-grind your beans. In my case, when I grind 8 cups worth of beans on fine, I run it twice to get that \"extra-fine\" grind for my espresso. Since the machine does get a little warm, I wait a minute or so before running the 2nd grind because I am aware that too much heat from the machine can kill some of the flavor of the espresso. I do this because I'm picky, not because it doesn't work. As a matter of fact, if only run one time, the fine setting did give me a grind good enough for the espresso maker, I just wanted my grounds to look/feel like flour mixed with a little salt if that makes any sense. Running the grinder twice gives me that texture. Either way, I get a consistent grind that is exactly what is needed to run a shot from my espresso maker.\n\nOther features not related to grinding: The cord is actually quite long. Some reviews complain about it being too short. In fact, it is wound up in the base of the grinder. Just unwind it and you'll have plenty of length to get your job done. The cup is sized very well - especially for my needs - and has a convenient lid that opens so you can pour the grinds in your coffee maker's basket or a bowl (like I do). The \"Chamber Maid\" does a good job cleaning the sides of the cup but doesn't really get to those stuck at the bottom. No big deal, as I just give a couple taps and they fall into my bowl.\n\nAll in all, I highly recommend this grinder. It is a very good grinder for the price. Very consistent from grind to grind. Has a timer so you won't over, or under, grind your beans (depending on the amount and coarseness settings). The lid opens for your convenience, has a long enough cord, and the cleaning system does a decent job.\n\nAs usual, Amazon shipped promptly in a well-packaged box."

It works every bit as well as it did when I bought it six years ago, which is pretty incredible considering the price. For reference, I use this product 3-5 times/week. 10/10 I would buy this product again!\n\nI purchased the Mr. Coffee IDS77 Electric Coffee Grinder in an effort to help me cut down on my Starbucks habit. I've had it for several months now, and so far I've been really pleased. This is my first coffee grinder so I can't compare it to any other models, but for what it's worth, I have no desire to purchase a different one. The grinder is so easy to use - just use the buttons to select the number of cups you're grinding for and your desired level of coarseness (fine, medium or coarse), add beans and press down on the lid. After just a few seconds, your freshly ground beans are ready to brew. When you remove the lid to pour the ground beans into your coffee maker or french press it is a bit messy. I always have to wipe my counter down after I use this product, but from what I understand, this is pretty standard for most machines like this. I love that I can clean the bean chamber in my dishwasher, and this grinder is a great value. If you can't decide whether or not to purchase a coffee grinder in general, I certainly recommend doing so. Coffee tastes so much better when your beans are freshly ground (particularly if you store the beans in an airtight container), and I don't miss the coffee shop stuff at all. I would also recommend purchasing this model in particular because of its low cost and easy operation and cleaning."

            "reviewText": "This is the bomb! Seriously. It allows you to grind a normal quantity of coffee beans and also select between coarse, medium and fine grind (I'm presuming you don't have to grind really large quantities of coffee beans at once). The \"chamber maid\" mechanism helps to get the bottom, oily part of the ground coffee out of the grinder without getting the coffee grounds all over the place (or your fingers). BEST OF ALL, you can pop the entire grinding chamber off and put it in the dishwasher--you can't beat that with a stick! The snap on part is a little tricky to get used to and you have to play with it a bit to line up the grind chamber with the grind motor button. But this is a small inconvenience considering time saved not having to clean up coffee grinds that inevitibly get all over everything. Convenient, useful and very cost effective, I might add. Like I said, this thing's the bomb."

With my Buy 3 Get 1, I decided to try a different grinder, and this one caught my eye. I like, very much, the ability to remove the grinder cup and use it alone (not the whole grinder) to transfer the ground coffee. And I like being able to wash it. I also like having an adjustable but consistent grinding time. I'm still trying to decide just which setting to use, but am happy that I have the choice and that, once set, the grind will remain consistent. I would prefer that water didn't get between the base and the bowl (you'll see what I mean if you buy it), but I think I'll try the dishwasher occasionally to prevent any \"culture\" growth.\n\nDo note that the cord is not as short as it appears (and as has been complained about). While it's a good idea to keep the cord as short as is practical and safe, there's more cord available - you just need to \"unspool\" it. It's a tiny bit tricky, but you can unwind more cord from the base."

You select the grind, hold down the button on-top until it stops, and voila! you're ready to brew! No guessing on how long for a certain amount of coffee! Using Peet's Coffee all the time, you get the perfect amount of grind for the type of brewer. I have both a drip and French-Press method brewers, so this grinder is ideal. Reasonably-priced, but does a great job for those of us who are not quite coffee-experts, but like the taste of the stuff!

I've found that shaking the grinder about halfway through the cycle makes it more uniform, but I'm sure Mr. Coffee would not recommend this action. Do it at your own risk, but it seems to work well for me."

You need to measure the beans you are putting in, select the right settings and hold the on button until it's complete. It's very noisy vs my old Hamilton Beach grinder, but, the cup also completely removes from the unit so it's very easy to clean. I use (right now) Kicking Horse HooDoo Jo, it's a very greasy bean, so tends to stick a lot (this being easy to clean helped here). Since today is the first day I'm using it, I can't comment on durability, though the construction seems to be solid. I gave it a 4/5 purely because of the noise factor...you are going to wake up anyone within 100 feet (not joking here)."

In addition to that, i added a few drops of turbine oil to the shaft and covered the rubber gear with a thin coating of jb-weld to reinforce it. So far this thing is awesome, but I use my ninja for pulverizing peppers now, as it is quicker and holds more."

Super easy to measure, adjust, and just hold down the grind button until it is done. No manually timing yourself! The top tips up for easy pouring, and you can also as easily remove parts and clean it with a paper towel. Stylish with a integrated cord wrap, this is a great grinder.

It's nice that it has settings for the amount of beans you want to grind as well as the type of grind you'd want to produce. It takes the guesswork out of thinking about how long to grind for. You just hold the button down and when it stops you're done. I will point out that sometimes the consistency of the grind is a little off. I've found half beans in the mix sometimes. No biggy though, just hit the button for a little longer. It seems the more beans in the grinder, the more consistent the grind, as the beans aren't hopping around everywhere.\n\nFor sure I'll be buying another bur grinder later, but this will definitely do for the time being."

I actually work around coffee so I know that it's best to have freshly ground coffee to have optimal flavor. While there are many nice burr grinders available, I wanted a little one that I could bring with me if needed! Works well for it's purpose. While I would love more customization for the grind, as opposed to \"course, medium, and fine\" it's understandable that such a price efficient grinder lacks these options."

The reason this item received 4 items from me is that the default cup capacity and grind level are set up and they stay the way they were used the last time. I always use fine grinding and the maximum capacity, while the default is 4 cups and medium. This does not impact the great function of the grinder. It does not get hot after multiple round of usage and seems like it would last for some while."

You are able to get the grind to be very course, or powder if you need. Keep in mind that if you don't rotate the grinder while you are using it, then you can end up with inconsistent grind. You will have powder at the very bottom and courser grinds toward the top. Rotating it back and forth and shaking it while pulsing the grinder helps with this. It is not perfect, but for the price, I highly recommend."

A month ago the cleaning chamber broke but I was still happy I got so much use out of it. I decided I'm going to replace it with the same grinder so of course I came onto Amazon and ordered it. When it came home, I was very happy. I threw out the box immediately with the old one in it was excited to continue using the new one.\nI have to say I am extremely disappointed in the new one. It doesn't grind well at all (when I empty the grinds after making coffee, I see quite a bit of unground beans on the top), there seems to be a gap between the cover and the main device (the cover being the one where you have to push down to operate it) which makes a lot of coffee bean mess come out. The sound of grinding too is just not great. Very very disappointed."

That being said, I do have one criticism, and that has to do with the design of the inside chamber. The lid is easy to take off but appears as though it was designed to stay on while you empty the fresh grounds into your coffee pot, but it might as well not be. Each and every time I have used this grinder, I have had to take the lid off and gently hit it against the base several times to try and knock loose the grounds stuck to the lid. What is worse is the amount of grounds that get stuck inside, either under the blades or against these 3 pieces of plastic that hug the walls of the chamber and attach to the lid. Instead of holding down the button and just dumping the grounds into my coffee pot, I spend a few minutes each morning trying to shake out the grounds invariably get stuck inside. I think today is the first day I didn't end up with some grounds on my counter. And yes, I do realize no grinder is going to be spotless when you empty the chamber, but I suspect most grinders wont hold on to anywhere from a teaspoon to a tablespoon of grounds when you turn it upside down and gently hit the bottom.\n\nI concede this is my first coffee grinder, and perhaps this is a common issue for most grinders. While I wish I had known about this issue before buying this particular grinder, I can't say it would have prevented me from buying it. It isn't a terrible inconvenience, just a minor annoyance with a product I am otherwise quite happy with."

For the price this is such a good little grinder that also looks very sleek in the kitchen.\n\nAlso the plastic case comes off the top so you can clean this one which is super simple to wash everytime you use it, its just like washing out a cup as all the parts inside the holding tank move around the wall of the container so just stick a sponge inside and wipe and the parts will move with the sponge."

I don't grind a lot of coffee so I just used it for the third time and in the process of grinding some coffee beans, it stopped. I tried to let it sit for a while, tried different outlets but to no avail. Seems the durability is pretty low. If you think you'll want to use it more than a couple of times I would consider another product."

You then take the cup off the machine and pour the coffee into your filter. The problem is, no matter how much grinding, there is always a layer of big chips on top of the grounds when the coffee is done. I never see them when I look into the cup or in the filter after I pour the coffee in. The coffee always tastes good, though."

The grind in very good, I am not a coffee grinder expert but this grinder does the job and it does it well. I can see if someone is particular about how fine or how the coffee is ground, how they would have complaints about this grinder. However if you are a normal, everyday coffee drinker then this grinder will work awesome for you. The grinder itself is not very loud, there is some noise, I mean its grinding coffee, but its really nominal. The bowl itself has these spinning arms on the inside that you can spin around the get some of the loose coffee grinds out. The only complaint I have, is the way the bowl is designed, the base of the bowl is metal, but the clear plastic from the top pf the bowl wraps down around the metal part, when you wash the bowl, the water get in between the metal and the plastic. This does not affect the way the machine works, but if you're particular like I am, it will bug you to see the water stuck there until it dry out naturally. Any rate, I would recommend this grinder to friends and family, pretty darn good machine."

Cute.\n3) It was an Amazon lightning deal. So it was very inexpensive.\n4) The top is removable into which to pour the coffee beans. The blades are in the cup holding the beans which can be lifted out of the unit so you can pour the grinded coffee into your coffee vault, coffee maker, etc.\n5) The exterior of the coffee grinder is mainly a shiny black plastic. Modern clean look.\n\nIve read many of the reviews for this grinder & others. There are many picky reviews for grinders under $20.00.\nWhat do people expect for less than $20.00? I will update this review in a few months. So far SOOOOO GOOD!"

So if you put in too many beans, that unit knew when to stop and hold the remaining beans for the next use while letting you remove the cup of grinds to put in your coffeemaker. This Mr. Coffee machine doesn't do that as the same cup is used for the beans pre- and post-grinding."

Then you LIFT the top portion up and pour that and then put it back on the unit. Thats what I like about it the most.\n\nPro- Easy to clean unit. Detachable chamber.

The ability to wash the parts easily was a great selling point, and that was pretty easy to do. It's been treated gently and hasn't even been used every day. As a grinder, it worked fine. The way it broke was just by unscrewing the top to put in beans. That action, this time, caused the plastic part inside the basket to crack and a piece of it fell off. My guess is that the plastic part got brittle over time. I have left an email on the Mr.Coffee web site in addition to putting comments here.\nUpdate: I contacted the maker through email and they have replaced the grinder as of November 1st. They responded promptly."

The grind chamber comes off the machine quite nicely for pouring the grounds out and the top comes off the chamber for cleaning. The parts twist on and off very nicely, very well made. And cleaning is a breeze, with no more mess on my counter. All in all, a very good purchase for the price. And let's not forget to mention that the coffee tastes great.\n\nI also want to remind everyone about something that other reviewers mentioned and I had forgotten: out of the box, the cord is really short, like only a few inches. The rest is tucked in under a ridge around the bottom and it is not obvious that it pulls out. Be sure to do this."

When I set the unit for medium grinding setting, I can use less coffee in comparison to the use of my Cuisinart Grind and Brew coffee unit. And the good thing is that the power is not too fine to pass thru the filter either. If you have a black color coffee maker, it will fit very well with it. The grinder is not loud when it operates. Overall, I am very pleased with this product."

Next, it leaves a lot of unground beans, which is a waste of expensive coffee. This grinder used to do a good job grinding beans, for the price--but no longer. I would not recommend it. We are beyond the 30 day return or we would send it back. Do not waste your money. Furthermore, the replacement Mr. Coffee 8-cup drip coffee maker doesn't heat the water sufficiently nor distribute it evenly enough to make a good cup of coffee, although the previous version used to. We are so sick of how companies these days are putting out products of less and less quality just to shave off greater profits for themselves. It is finally to the point where products sold in the US are junk, all made in China, to which US jobs and pride of workmanship were lost."

Mess free, no guessing when the beans are done because it shuts off when it's ground to the setting of Course Medium or Fine. It also has an amount setting for less grinding time from 2-12 cups. It's nice because it's easy to pour out when ground. Just twist the top section and the entire grinding mechanism becomes portable. Great for grinding homegrown dried peppers, herbs and spices from the garden. The grinding blades will not spin unless the safety lid is down. The lid is the switch. Just push down and hold and it does everything else but clean itself. Simple to clean but watch out for the blades if you are accident prone...certain to make you spring a leak!"

Would definitely buy another one; in fact I may buy one just to use for spices.\n\nNice looking, doesn't take up a lot of space. Can't beat it for the money!"

I use it for everything but coffee beans. I have used it for making pesto, grinding nuts, spices and seeds, making buckwheat flour and lentil flour. Well, after all the abuse I have given it, a part of the plastic cleaning chamber broke. So I snapped it off since it was loose. But it still worked after that. Then the motor gave out. Lucky for me, my dad fixed it. Now my grinder is working just like before.\n\nI think this is a great grinder. I especially like that you can detach the bowl from the rest of the machine so it makes it easy to clean. Not many models of coffee grinders have that feature. All in all, if this one completely gave out, I would go and buy another one. Or perhaps I would buy this one http://amzn.to/1zqKqPC since it looks durable and it comes with 2 stainless steel bowls as opposed to the Mr. Coffee which is made of plastic. I'll let you know if I make that purchase...."

            "reviewText": "Utilizing this coffee grinder for a use other than what is was intended for (grinding up dry dog food), it is just ok. I'm fairly sure that dry dog food is generally softer and lends itself better to grinding than hard coffee beans however, I find that I have had to replace this grinder on an average of every six months due to a snapping off of the grinding blades which renders the entire machine useless. I also found that the \"Chamber Maid Cleaning System\", although a good idea in theory, was comtributing to the early snapping of the grinding blades as the blades would sometimes get caught up in the plastic chamber maid inside the grinding cup. Now when I receive a new grinder, I automatically snap off the plastic \"chamber maid\" from the cup which seems to have prolonged the life of the blades. But I do believe the problem arises because the blades get dull too quickly.\n\nNot being able to replace just the grinder cup, I've had no choice but to reorder the entire grinder. Luckily it is not an extremely expensive item and, when it's working, it serves my purpose nicely. Contrary to the fragility of the grinding blades, I have never had an issue with the motor burning out. The motor seems to be of a solid design. The breakage of the grinding blades is the reason for the three star (\"it's okay\") rating."

After so much time, I've learned more about the art of making coffee and what a difference using a burr grinder vs. a blade grinder makes in the final result of your coffee. With that said, this is a lot less expensive and has fit the bill for a long time. If you're on a budget and just need a simple grinder, this will work great for you."

The closest it can get is barely any coarser than a medium grind. It also produces a lot of dust which is not good for any type of coffee makers. These aspects combined make it a poor choice for french press users.\n\nAlso the grind is not very consistent, so it would not be horribly great for use with an espresso machine either.\n\nThis being said, the medium grind it can produce is good enough to use with standard drip coffee makers. If you only use drip machines and do not expect to try any other coffee brewing methods, then this is not that bad for the price, but other than that, there are better grinders on the market."

So, you have to untwist the top to take it off and the second part is also a twist off that you use to pour the coffee into the maker. Another part I don\"t like is at the bottom of the grinder accumulates coffee that you have to take a spoon to remove the remainder of the coffee. I would not recommend this product.\n\nBrian P"

The grinder automatically stops based on the number of cups you choose (4-12) and how fine you want the coffee (coarse-fine). In my opinion, the system runs a bit too long and over grinds the coffee if you choose the appropriate expected number of cups and grind. For a full pot of 12 cups, I choose medium grind and 8 cups. The cleanup system is very good, it cleans well. And the lid and grind chamber as removable for cleaning. The cord is cleverly hidden around the bottom of the grinder."

I wonder how much coffee we consumed that hit bits of plastic mixed in... It worked fabulously for the first 6-8 months when using it as directed, but I guess that's all it has in it. Now we're outside of the refund period, of course, but we definitely can't keep using it. Bummer."

Love the design, entire cup comes off so can pour grinds wherever without having to unplug unit. Lots of little features packed into inexpensive product.\n\nOnly complaint is the tiny length of cord (and yes, I DID unwrap it from the base fully). I think it says should be 3 ft., mine is only 2 ft. If this is what is advertised, then so be it - however, 3-4 ft would have been useful.\n\nAll in all, still a great bargain!

I was very disappointed, and decided to order a Zassenhaus coffee grinder with a 25 years guarantee just to make sure I will get coffee for sure."

It's very comfortable. Much easier to clean. I like the future that I can take off the top and keep coffee in it for a while. I would definitely recommend this coffee grinder. Thanks Amazon.

            "reviewText": "To start: I really wanted to like this coffee grinder. I like to think of myself as an educated buyer, and I do not make impulse purchases that often. I've read most of the reviews on this grinder, and I found that the gripes were true, and than some.\na) Very cumbersome engineering of the lid. The detachable chamber has two \"lids\", the large one with a black ring that comes off, and another \"flap-lid\" that sits on top of that one. I guess the idea is to use the flip lid to pour your beans, and than to take the bigger lid when pouring the grounds out? Not sure about logic behind this redundancy.\nb) The \"Chamber Maid\" system is an excellent idea...but in reality it is more in the way than being useful. It is in the way when you trying to put the lid on the chamber, and than the prongs are in the way when you are trying to clean the chamber (since no, they do NOT clean the chamber totally clean. I am a bit fastidious, and I like to start the grinding without mixing old with fresh coffee. Yes, its a minute thing, but still...)\nc)To line the lid with the activation button is not for the impatient. The activation button presses on the miniscule \"safety\" pin that is the size of the tip of the pen. One hair tho the left or to the right - its a no-go.\nd) the shear amount of pressure on the \"Go\" button needed to activate the grinder is mind-boggling. I cannot see an elderly person being able to operate this.\nd) Noisy. By far the loudest of all the coffee grinder I had. I know this comes with the territory, but still, my previous GE was NOT this loud.\ne) Cable length&stowage. Again, reviews about the short cable are true. Not that big of an issue, but still. There is not-so-user-friendly way to coil the cable back in the base, but it is such a pain that I leave mine out.\n\nPositives: excellent Fit&Finish. The material quality is good, it does not feel cheeply made. There are settings on the side to pre-set your grind and time, but after few trials, I learn to ignore them, and just keep grinding to my own accord until I get the finesse of the ground coffee the way I want it.\n\nConclusion: Over-engineered beyond being user-friendly."

I kept trying to double grind the beans, adjust settings and after weeks of finding there were still unground beans I became disgusted when the coffee maker overflowed due to unground beans getting stuck in the filter. Too late to return it since it takes a while to discover how awful this grinder is. A complete waste of money."

This arrived very quickly, is easy to use (the instructions are very clear) and really easy to clean. I like my coffee at a full flavor so where it indicates to use the medium grind for our drip coffee maker, I usually go the \"fine grind\" route. Just put the beans in (not past the middle line), indicate how many cups you're making by pushing the top button to the selected amount up to 12 cups (4-8-12), select the grind, then press the top and hold. It will stop on its own when it's finished. Easy as pie! The price was right for us!"

Only this time, I learned from my mistake and simply bought the cheapest one I could find. My lesson: A coffee grinder doesn't need to be fancy; all it needs to do is grind beans, so don't be stupid like me and fall for a bunch of whistles and bells that don't really do anything. The second coffee grinder I bought was a Toastmaster 1119, your basic no frills grinder -it was half the price, it's much easier to use, and so far, it's lasted twice as long (I've had it about 6 or 7 months now and it's working fine).\nI hope this helps someone! :)"

I recently bought some coffee beans that required grinding and so I pulled this little guy out again. After only filling it with beans to the max line mark and holding down the grind button so that it could do a medium course grind, the coffee that resulted was inconsistently ground and I noticed the coffee grinder was very hot - almost smoking. I tipped the grinds into another container for storage purposes and re-filled the unit to the max line again, to grind a second batch. After the second grind was over, the unit was visibly smoking (I was concerned it was on fire on the inside) and emitting a noxious burning plastic smell. I quickly shut off the power, pulled the cord out of the socket and moved the coffee grinder to the top of my stainless steel sink so that if it was in fire, I'd be able to act quickly and safely. I assume the fuse blew because it eventually stopped smoking, but after only using this machine a half a dozen times or so, I'm very disappointed this ever made it to market. It's a health and safety concern and in my opinion, all units with the faulty fuse should have been recalled. I would not buy from Mr Coffee again in future as I can only surmise the brand is unethical and produces rubbish quality goods."

With the first 2 grinders the motors failed, both within a very short period of time. Up to this point My Mr Coffee grinder has worked very well. It is a lot quieter then the other two and it seems I get a better grind. It must be because this grinder offers 3 different settings for grinding. I get a more consistent grind with this grinder especially in the morning when I've forgotten tho grind my coffee beans he night before. Not real impressed with the Chamber maid cleaning system, although I get less waste, for me that is not a big issue. I think I have had this grinder for about 5 months without any break downs. I still need more time to say this product is absolutely superior over the other two,it certainly was less expensive of the three grinders. I also think that the white and black one should have been offered for the same price."

Yes, careful inspection of ALL the pictures would have told me this as well, but I assumed it was properly categorized. Minus 1 star.\n\nReviewing it as a blade grinder, it works fine... and is pretty cheap. But I probably would have just picked up another Krups grinder if I wanted a blade grinder. The 'automatic' controls on it are a bit hokey... You set the grind and number of cups, but sill have to hold down the button the entire time. It just shuts off automatically. Honestly if you've ground more than a dozen batches of beans you have a feel for how long to grind by sound alone, so it really just makes it more work to check/set the device every time or have it shut off early. Minus a second star.\n\nOK, it was only $14, so I'll quit my complaining and keep it anyway, but Amazon, please move this grinder to the proper section!"

But later on that day I tried to use it again and it wouldn't turn on. Apparently, its really easy to burn this grinder out. Called amazon immediately to return it and they refunded my money and didn't even want me to send the product back. That's how bad this thing is. Its little and cute, but that means nothing when it's sitting in my trash can. Ive always appreciated that fact that Amazon has great customer service! Very disappointed in the product though."

My problem is that on the outside of the cup, there is plastic that goes over the stainless steel base. Over the months, water has been able to get in between that plastic and the base but hasn't really been able to air out the way it needs to. As a result, I'm seeing rust and possibly mold growing in those spaces. It's on the outside of the cup, nowhere near where the actual coffee goes, but it bothers me that it's happening as I like to keep my things looking nice and clean."

If you want whole beans mixed in with fine powder and every size in between for your french press, it's great. If you want your grounds to have the bloom of the Sahara in August, it's great.\nIf you actually want consistent and appropriately sized grounds, get a conical burr grinder. A hand grinder is well worth it if you're going for cheap, self-made coffee and not much more expensive than this waste of $20. It's really not much work or time hand grinding. Unless you can't use your arms. I spent almost as much time trying to get  decent grounds out of this as I did just doing it the right way with a hand grinder. Much, much happier tossing this blunt blade blender for even a $40 hand grinder.\nThis blender also sounds like, well, a blender. It's Loud and if you tend to hibernate with bears and Sandy Cheeks like myself and if you wake them up without a mug of coffee..... Well, just do yourself a favor and get a hand grinder.\nPros: Easy to be lazy. Cheap. Easy to push the button down once you get the sucker lined up right."

Coffee lovers will tell you that you should use a burr grinder to get consistently sized grounds, which promotes even extraction and makes the coffee taste the way it should. Well, it wasn't an upgrade at all! On the coarsest setting, the Chefman burr grinder I \"upgraded\" to produced a lot more fine powder than this Mr. Coffee grinder does, and much more bitter coffee.\n\nDon't get me wrong. I'm not saying this makes completely consistent coffee grounds. You'd probably have to spend over $200 for a highly-rated burr grinder for that. (However, I've never had the experience other reviewers have mentioned of having a whole bean that wasn't ground at all.)\n\nMy point is that this is a competent little grinder that takes up very little counter space and is very easy to clean. I'm still on the hunt for a better grinder, but until I find it, I'll feel no shame in continuing to use this one. Let the coffee snobs look down their noses at me"

Shell out another ten bucks and just buy a Magic Bullet blender and use it to grind your coffee.\n\nThe instructions say choose your grind fine/medium/coarse and choose how many cups you are making. If I choose Fine and 4 cups, which is what my stovetop espresso percolator uses, I get giant chunks of coffee bean amid very coarse grounds. I have to put it on the 12 cups setting and run it a couple times to get a proper fine grind for four cups of espresso.\n\nI would return this if I hadnt already used it and buy a burr grinder, or a magic bullet."

The best part of it is that it has a way to customize the grind according to the amount of cups and the size coarseness desired, although I typically set it for more cups than I'm actually going to brew. Cleans easily enough if you're not a jackass. What more could you want out of cheap electronics?"

Money was tight and I had a Gevalia coffee maker (the one they used to give you free for trying their coffee) and I needed a fine grind. This was the cheapest coffee grinder Kmart had so I bought it. It did a great job making a fine grind. After I moved, I had minimal counter space. I switched to a French press coffee maker so I could put it in the cupboard to recoup the three feet of counter space I do have. Now I need a course grind. I fill it up with coffee completely, set it to 8-10 cups, and shake it while I press the grind button. If I don't shake it, there are chunks of coffee beans mixed in. Maybe more work than buying a new one, but it is 11 years old and still works. That in and of itself is amazing in this day and age - especially considering it only cost about $10 at the time."

Within 6 months of buying this grinder the top button used to make the grinder start broke off and we've been using pens to operate for the last 4 years. The blades dulled after about 1 year and it took a long time to get things finely ground. It was almost impossible to clean out the nooks and crannies of the lid if you want to grind something other than coffee. With the grind settings on the side - the buttons became stuck so you couldn't change the coarseness of the grind and the words wore off so I had no idea what setting it was on. The lid and twist off grind cup were very annoying to use. Everything has to be lined up like a food processor to work. It's not hard to figure out, but when you're stumbling around in the morning trying to make coffee it's difficult with your limited motor skills. This was the most hated kitchen tool I owned. I'm really glad it died so I can get a different brand."

My ex-wife took position of the grinder and coffee pot. Thought I could without for awhile but I missed my coffee. Checked reviews on grinders and coffee makers (a Mr. Coffee as well) and learned I couldn't beat what I had. The Krups is nice but I would really miss the removable top (which holds the grounds). The one my wife took with her was at least 8-10 years old and it was still doing it's job. I thought I would try something different but none offered the the features and results that this one did and as a prior user, I knew it to be a fact. People complaining about the cord? it's wound up underneath the grinder - pull it out to a length you prefer! The grind results? c'mon, this unit will produce a nice fine, medium or course grind using the settings and depending on how long you grind it. I do usually give it a jiggle when grinding to ensure all beans are ground - this is mostly needed because I use a lot of beans and I do surpass the max \"do not fill above this line\" mark for a 12 cup coffee maker (what can I say? I like a strong brew, I'm Norwegian) - this is an excellent grinder especially for the money."

It can grind coffee from coarse to fine.\n- You can grind a pretty large amount of coffee beans at once (up to 10 cups' worth).\n\nCons:\n- The cord is short. I knew this when I bought it, and I didn't think it would bother me. Well, it turns out that a short cord can make things very inconvenient.\n- The grinder has 3 parts: the base, the 'bowl' to hold coffee beans, and the lid. It's a pain to put all three parts together! You see those words and lines on the bowl and the lid for locking and fitting the pieces together? It is NOT a breeze. Sure, it only takes an extra 10-20 seconds to figure out than traditional lids, but when I'm making coffee in the morning, those 20 seconds can be extremely irritating (especially before you've had your coffee!). I also did not realize how annoying this was until I used my roommate's Krups coffee grinder - you literally just put the lid on top and push down the button. After that, I just haven't found the patience to fiddle with the bowl and the lid every morning. I've experienced how much easier life can be and now I can't go back!\n\nSummary: This will get the job done, but the usability isn't great. Get the Krups grinder instead for the same price... your future self will be happier and you won't even know it!"

But if you're \"coffee-powered\" like me, and you just need that first cup as soon as you get up, this \"grinder\" does make you a cup of coffee really fast with little effort and time. Wake you up enough to make real coffee with your real grinder that makes coffee as good as the beans actually are.\n\nAnyway, I have been using this as my primary go-to grinder for several years. It is a good product when you want ground coffee with minimal effort and time spent. It is easy to use, it has automatic timers for different amounts of grind and fineness of grind, it makes consistent size of grinds, and it is easy to clean.\n\nDespite it lacking any grinding action, i give it 5 stars because it is a damn good obliterator.

Certain things had to be in the right spot, clicked in the right way, held centered while I ground it. The lid for pouring flopped and clicked around and made pouring a very messy endeavor. I tried it and my husband thought I must be doing it wrong so he tried and we both got coffee grounds on the counter and in the sink. It's much easier to just scoop coffee out of the basket with a spoon, making the floppy lid pointless.\n\nIt's much louder and larger than my Proctor Silex grinder. I prefer the quite hum of mine to the loud, plasticy whir this makes.\n\nThe last nail in the coffin was the \"wind up\" cord that took way too long and was a pain to shove in the hole. My current grinder winds up with a manual twist of the lid and takes about three seconds. No motorized parts, nothing to break. That's probably why it's lasted me so long!

Well, about a week later, the plastic wipers in the 'Chamber Maid' bowl ground up with the beans. After picking the plastic bits out of the ground coffee, the grinder still worked...for a while. The grinder operation is a pain in the a... The removable bowl has to be inserted using a registration mark to line up grooves and rotated to a certain point, then the lid has to be inserted by using a different registration mark and rotated a different amount to a certain point for the grinder to operate. After dialing in the grind and number of cups, you hold the run button down untill the grinder stops. Then you can remove the bowl and use the flip lid and pour spout to pour some of the coffee out somewhat accurately. Then you unscrew the flip lid from the bowl (be sure to do this over the sink or trashcan to catch ground coffee caught in the groove between the lid and the bowl) and after tapping the bowl against the sink, pour the rest of the grind into your filter holder. All my wife and I wanted was a good cup of morning coffee...Please!!! Bought a Krups on Amazon and now we're happy."

However, I don't recommend it because there is a small metal bowl at the bottom of the plastic container where the blade actually sits. There is space between the metal bowl and the outer plastic, and anything you grind can and will get stuck between them. It's actually impossible to clean, even with water, soaking, dish washer, etc., because the space is so very thin. It's quite gross/unsanitary. (Though I kept using it . . .

The cleaning mechanism (really three cheap plastic blades) that rotates inside the chamber gets a little of the coffee off the sides but leaves a dusting. The chamber itself does not come apart so you are left trying to clean out the bottom where all the coffee settles, which is a huge pain to dry afterwards. Then the bottom of the chamber has a metal \"bowl\" that is covered in plastic. The gap between the two allows water to bleed in and there isn't any way to get it out, which leads to rust and mold. Not a good design feature at all. Save your money on this and look for something better."

The vanes handily remove your freshly ground coffee. A couple of spins and a couple of taps and you're done.

It takes such a small amount of beans, so there's no way you could grind enough in one batch to make a full pot of coffee. This I found annoying. I don't keep it plugged in on the counter, so each time I plugged it in I had to re-set everything; number of cups, grind quality, before using. Too much of a pain, and I'd rather just have one that simply does the job.\nLastly, today when I used it, the plastic pieces inside that help clean out the coffee grounds, was in pieces when I opened it up. It had broken up and pieces were in the coffee. Bad design. Cheaply made.

This seemed to fit the bill. The price is great. I do like that it takes the guess work out of how long to grind, and it looks sleek sitting on the counter. You do have to hold the button down while grinding. However, I make 16 oz of coffee at a time, not a full 12-cup pot. That means I have to hold the button down for about 25 or 30 seconds. It's fine. My coffee always tastes great. There aren't ever any beans that didn't grind.\n\nWhat I don't like about this grinder is how messy it is. My first grinder had a large domed lid and was all stainless steel inside. After being ground, the coffee just slid out with very few grinds sticking to the walls or the top of the grinder. The flat lid on this grinder catches tons of coffee and holds it in all the little cracks and crevices. The cleaning system inside (which is really just a couple of plastic bars that rotate around the cup, scraping the sides) just cause the coffee to clump up. Every time I use this grinder I have to take the small coffee brush that came with my first grinder and sweep the coffee off the lid, from under the blades, from around the cleaning bars, and then from around my counter where some of it has inevitably fallen as I tried to sweep out the grounds. It's irritating. So irritating that I'm online now looking for a replacement. I just don't have the extra four or five minutes each morning that this grinder requires to clean up."

I give this two stars because the chamber maid cleaning works great for about 3 months and really helps to scrape the fines off the chamber bottom and walls but it is made of thin, weak plastic strips that easily break. Once one of the three strips snaps off it is over! The other two will follow shortly and it's back to coffee fines building up on the bottom and using whatever apparatus that's handy to scrape them out. A messy and wasteful chore!\n\nIf $20 is all you have to spend then as I said, the motor is strong and has lasted me 1 1/2 years. Maybe just be mindful of the plastic chamber maid strips penchant for breaking and be very gentle with it and maybe they will last longer for you than they did for me. If you have more than $20 to spend then just spring for a conical burr grinder which is what I finally ended up springing for. I'm still waiting for it to arrive and then my Mr. Coffee grinder will be sold for $1 at my summer yard sale."

It also has big plastic pieces that seem really arbitrary. They just get in the way when you are arduously trying to get any grinds out. The lid also removed AND hinges??? so grinds get stuck where it hinges and its akward to hold open while trying to get the GD beans out. IN ADDITION, the cord does not retract all the way into the bottom, even though the bottom is supposed to be cord storage.\nIt also has 8 buttons that dont seem to do much of anything. Why does a coffee grinder need so many buttons?\nI hate it every morning.\nI will be switching back to proctor-silex."

            "reviewText": "My wife and I have used this workhorse 2-4 times daily for about 2 years. Works as advertised, and there probably isn't a better coffee grinder in this price range.\n\nMain problem: The plastic \"chamber maid\" broke relatively quickly. First, after about 6 months, it stopped rotating with the lid (so I would rotate it with my fingers after taking the lid off). Then, after about two years, it broke entirely, and needed to be pulled out of the chamber and tossed. The grinder now continues to work fine, but doesn't have the chamber maid feature to help keep the chamber from accumulating a lot of stale grounds.\n\nMy brother has the same product, and he had a similar experience -- the chamber maid plastic parts broke in less than a year of daily use.\n\nI contacted Mr. Coffee to see if it is possible to replace the chamber (so that I don't have to buy a whole new grinder -- the motor still works fine). I was told that they do not sell the chamber as a replacement part. I guess not too surprising, since the whole thing is only $20."

The operation is then timed, but Ive never found the grind to be right, so have to activate it again and again. For espresso, the grind is horrible, resulting in both large particles and powder which then clogs my maker.\n\nThe manual makes it sound like the 3 long cord is a safety feature for the user, but in reality its just a super inconvenient, cost-cutting measure for them, requiring you to hover it in front of the outlet to use.\n\nGrind compartment and its lid are full of nooks and crannies, so super messy are hard to get your coffee out."

I now pay 15 bucks for 40oz 100% Colombian coffee and it lasts 2 months. Yes, it does taste better ground fresh. It is easy to clean and operate. I hope it lasts awhile in it's new home. I gave the guy a small coffee pot with the filters I didn't use. He's going to save a lot of money making it himself, and will be safer than walking to Quik Trip for his 2 cups a day.

It's also quite small, about the size of a plastic drink tumbler. (Note, picture makes it look a lot larger than its actual size.) This small size means it fits nicely on your counter, BUT it has a tiny motor (which clearly labors hard when making fine grinds) and it's capacity is absurdly small. You might think that it can grind a lot more than those tiny pint-size coffee/nut all-purpose grinders (the ones that hold about 30 grains of coffee). In reality, it's NOT much larger. It doesn't help that is has a Max Capacity line that's about halfway up the grinding cup. If you're planning to grind small amounts from time to time, this is a good option. If you're planning to grind lots of coffee, frequently, this is not your machine."

It's a blade grinder, there isn't a different pulse or something that's going to change your grind. It merely is going to time and shut off based on what you set. If you unplug it, you'll have to redo your settings each time if you decide to use this rather pointless feature. The grinds get stuck to the bottom so that cleaning maid is more a fairy tale. I read some reviews say the arms had worn thin, indicating perhaps plastic being added to your coffee. I haven't noticed that myself and just wanted a blade grinder something inexpensive for the time being. I previously think I've tried Krups, Melita, this thing and a Starbucks one I can't recall the brand for which an old roommate used to have. Of blade grinders for 20 bucks or less, Krups is clearly seeming to be the way to go. Burr grinders are a pain to clean in my overall experience and I don't notice any real difference in the grind despite all the arguments over burr grinding being more squeezing the bean where blades are smashing them around. There is not going to be a noticeable difference that I have found yet in burr vs. blade. Just don't overgrind and burn the oils and be sure to keep things clean and wiped down between bags, especially if you change varieties and you'll be good to go. I gave it two stars because it has been a functional tool for the most part. Some sticking of the button due to design and how grinds can interfere with the switch also. I did like the way the chamber was removable which made for slightly easier cleaning that a one piece. But that's pretty much the only redeeming factor here. Hope this helps you with your purchase, happy shopping!"

So I tried the second time choosing different combinations. Still the same. Finally I decided to only put in enough beans for 2 cups of coffee and that seemed to work. Since I want to grind more than that at a time and don't want to do it in batches I'm opting for a different grinder.\n\nThen there's the cord issue. I've read that there is 37 in. of cord from another consumer, but I found no way to pull out the short 6 in. of cord that protrudes from the bottom. I found nothing in the directions about more cord, but only an explanation as to why there is such a short cord - in the event a pet gets tangled in it. Really? I've never had a problem with any of my dogs on the counter or even around the house getting tangled in cords! As for me, I prefer not to not have to stand there holding the grinder as it does it's job.\n\nOn a bright note, the the housing is nice and creates no mess when used. It has a nice pour feature, and it's easy to clean. This is not enough to make me want to keep it. I'm taking it back and going back to Krups. I had a Krups that lasted for 15 years, ground spices, nuts, and coffee beans. The only reason I didn't get one this time is the local store did not have it on the shelf. I think they should take this on off the shelf. I need an even grind to get the most out of the whole bean. Furthermore, if you DO want to grind spices and nuts it specifically states it is not for that."

What I didn't' like:\n- the consistency of the grind: even after a couple rounds of the timed grinding, while most would be ground up, I would still find bigger pieces of bean in the mix (only a few... but still... 45 to 60 seconds of grinding gave me everything from powder to a couple beans left at about peppercorn size.)\n-the hinged lid: (why?) Even if I were to pour my ground coffee out of the hinged lid, you need to remove it to spin the plastic scrapers to loosen the finer-ground coffee that gets packed into the grinding chamber. Also the lid has more 'nooks and crannies' than seems necessary (partially due to the hinged feature) making places for grind to stick.\n-the plastic scrapers in the grind chamber. functional? somewhat but I still found the need to get my finger to the bottom of the chamber to loosen up the grounds near the blade.\n-the timed grinding: just more design than necessary in my opinion. I guess if you are looking for a consistently inconsistent grind, then setting to the cycle of your choice might be a 'nice feature'.\n\nWhat I DID like: The removable grinding chamber. Made it easy to clean up for the return.\n\nSUMMARY: I think this is an example of a product that is way over-designed for its purpose. Lots of bells and whistles that don't compensate for the less-than-ideal grinding capabilities.\n\nMy Krups (203) came yesterday, and this morning was happy to have a simple grinder that does its job well.

But, about 3 months ago, the plastic \"side scrapers\" (Chamber Maid Cleaning System) broke off while grinding. Today, I had the machine unplugged and put in a few tablespoons of coffee beans with the top/lid section off. Before putting the lid on, I plugged it into the wall and suddenly the grinder started grinding, sending coffee everywhere in the kitchen until I was able to unplug. I put on the lid, keeping my hand clear of the press/switch and plugged it in again. It started grinding again immediately. There is obviously something wrong with the switch. I cleaned the three-level switch contacts with needles and tried it. It is working correctly, but I'm for sure going to be a lot less trusting that it will work safely."

This was the least expensive model at Target that had the option to do a coarse grind. Keep in mind, I have never owned a coffee grinder before so I can't compare it to others. I can say that I am happy with my purchase. I like that you can change the settings for the number of cups and Med/fine/coarse ground and the machine automatically shuts off. This took the guess work out of how long to grind for me having never used a coffee grinder.\n\nI have noticed that the grinder doesn't grind the beans very consistently. When I choose coarse ground, there are noticeably larger pieces overall than the med setting but there is quite a lot of more finely ground coffee that remains in the bottom of my cup of coffee. I assume that is to be expected with this type of grinder. I still really like the freshly ground coffee from the french press - beats my automatic machine.\n\nI considered giving this 3 stars for the short cord until I read other reviews about the additional hidden length of cord (thanks, Amazon!). I really like this grinder for the price. Someday I may spring for a more expensive machine but I will keep this one for spices or something."

It still works, which is good, but it's annoying for these reasons:\n\n1. Compared to most push button grinders (like the Krups 203, Bodum Bistro, or Braun that I had), this one has 3 pieces and not just 2: lid, container, body. There's no point in having a separate lid, it's just one more thing to have to dirty. Separating the lid from the container gets grinds everywhere.\n2. Chambermaid cleaning system is pointless. It's just more moving parts, more to have to deal with. It also means you have to perfectly align the lid with the container, and the container with the body. Compare this to those other grinders where you can just put the container back on the body with your eyes closed.\n3. The timer is garbage. Small quantities end up overground regardless of setting. This isn't a burr grinder, but still... you're better off just figuring out how long you should grind your beans for and sticking with that (I roughly count seconds in my head). I use a french press, so grind size is important. It's also why I finally replaced this with a Capresso Burr grinder (at almost 4x the cost).\n\nIf you want a simple grinder, get one of the two I mentioned."

I bought this grinder primarily because it had a pouring spout and a cleaning device for the sides of the chamber. This was worse for emptying and cleaning than any other because the pouring spout and side-cleaning device trapped even more grounds than others. I could only think that the designers had deliberately done this to sabotage the brand! How is it possible that the company allowed this to get on the market without testing? Eventually, I learned to NOT use the pouring spot for emptying grounds -so it no longer traps them. The biggest improvement came after REMOVING the cleaning device with wire clippers! NOW I really enjoy this grinder because it grinds to my satisfaction, detaches from the motor portion, empties easily, cleans and even washes easily."

Whatever pitfalls it has are common to all blade grinders - it's not uncommon to find larger bean chunks mixed in with the medium grounds and a bit of finer dust. Consistency may be my biggest complaint - it just seems like it can be hard to reproduce the perfect cup once you think you've got it down. I got a cheap kitchen scale to weigh out the beans, which I think is helping.\n\nNow that I'm buying more premium single origin coffees I'm wondering if I should get a burr grinder, but it just seems overly complicated and expensive. Sure, I could get a less expensive manual burr grinder, but then I'll spend 3 minutes doing what this grinder can do in 15 seconds...

            "reviewText": "I purchased this unit on 31 Jan 2012 at a local Target store. It's a nice product, with auto shutoff and easy-clean grinding chamber. However, after about 20 uses, it abruptly shut off only 5 seconds into its usual 15-second grind.\n\nThe manual's troubleshooting section suggests that the \"thermal fuse is broken\" from an overheated motor, and states that the only recourse is authorized Sunbeam service center. Although the unit has a 1-year warranty, for a $20 item it's just not worth the time to pursue warranty service. So I searched online in vain for DIY repair instructions. (Turns out a lot of people have run into this same failure.) Then, I decided that for the benefit of others who might be tempted to do their own repair, I'd sacrifice my unit and post my findings here.\n\nThis failure occurred when the motor hadn't been running for long and the base was not warm to the touch. So I believe the manufacturer has specified an insufficient fuse, and/or should redesign the unit with a circuit breaker or automatic-reset fuse.\n\nHere goes with the technical repair info: You open the unit from the TOP, not the obvious-looking plastic cover on the bottom. There are 3 Phillips-head screws hidden underneath plastic caps located in wells around the inside perimeter of the bowl seen when you take the grinding chamber off. To get those caps out, you need to whack them sideways with hammer and screwdriver from the side closest to the center, forcing them outward and up. Obviously the manufacturer never intended them to be removed (and never considered the possibility that blown fuses could aggravate consumers).\n\nOnce the screws are removed, you can lower the base off the unit far enough to see a hex nut holding the circuit board in place (behind the front control panel). Remove this nut with needlenose or a socket wrench. On the underside of this circuit board is the offending fuse. I have yet to be certain which device it is, but I believe it's a copper-colored cylinder 4mm long and labeled Z01.\n\nThe part may or may not be readily available from third parties, but there are no published tech specs and the manufacturer does not sell replacement parts. Life is too short to chase down warranty service on poorly-designed devices. I rate this product Do Not Buy."

It has three settings, so you can have a course, medium or fine grind. The fine isn't magnificent, but if you put it in a bag and sold it, I doubt anyone would notice.\n\nThus far, I have ground chiles, seeds and even fresh lemongrass.

I don't know if I would call it really produces esspresso-grade grinds, but I have gotten my regular coffee buzz every morning.\n\n3) This is the biggest selling point. IT IS FRIGGIN EASY TO CLEAN! It has a detatchable grinding cup and dishwasher-safe lid. But seriously, you don't even need to go that far. Since the cup is stainless-steel, and since it has this plastic rig that lets you sweep loose grinds, all you need is a small-cicular brush and hot water to get it clean.\n\nThe time? About 15-20 seconds. No leftover grinds.\n\nBecause of this, you can grind multiple fresh spices rather quickly without worry of cross-contimnation. I can also say with confidence that I have had no fennel-tasting coffee. The fact that it is so easy to clean makes it versatile.\n\nIs it loud? I guess. And you may have to grind more than once to get a desired texture.\n\nBut the fact that it does what I want it to do and cleans easily makes it worth it."

I was pleasantly surprised to discover it grinds very evenly for a blade grinder, and doesn't make a mess while doing it. The \"chamber maid\" feature is somewhat useful, but on the fine grind setting, a lot of coffee still sticks to the inside. I have to use a little brush to free the grounds. It's not \"the perfect grinder\" but it is a \"clean\" grinder and I'm very satisfied with the performance so far. Still, it is an inexpensive unit constructed predominently of plastic parts, as I'd expect from the \"Mr. Coffee\" brand.

I have to say, I was very impressed! While you do have to hold the button down the whole time it grinds, it does shut itself off when finished, which is nice. The selling feature for me is the removable coffee chamber. You don't have to tip your grinder upside down and tap the coffee into the lid. Nor do you have to hold the entire unit over the sink while you wipe the inside and around the blade with a paper towel, hoping you don't nick your finger! You just pop out the cup, open the spout, and pour your grinds into your filter. Then comes the best part...you just wash the cup in the sink or place in your dishwasher, and voila! Clean as a whistle. And it seems to produce a very consistent grind, which makes me happy, knowing I will get a great cup of coffee. For you other \"coffee snobs\" out there, the grind chart is obviously way off. Unless you like your coffee to taste like Folgers, use more than the 3/4 tbsp per cup that they recommend! All in all, I am very pleased with this product, and for the price, you can't beat it!"

I can sleep peacefully in the mornings :)\n\nI like how the cord wraps around the bottom- I dont like when there are wires or cords all over the kitchen, it makes it look messy.\n\nIt's easy to clean. It was confusing at first with the twist this to get the lid off, twist this to get the cup out so you can clean it, but once you start using it, it's no biggie!"

            "reviewDate": "May 21, 2007",
            "reviewText": "First off, I have to say that many of the people who have complaints about this grinder may not have actually taken the extra few seconds to read the manual and understand how the device works. The grinder does a great job and my coffee is always perfect.\n\nto address some issues that others had:\n\n1. The plastic cleaning blade inside the grinding bowl needs to be manually spun (with your finger) to loosen the packed coffee grounds. Usually a single revolution will accomplish this task, then you can put this coffee in the maker!\n\n2. This grinder makes it easy to get the coffee into your coffee maker -- someone was complaining that it was more difficult to clean or use because it comes apart -- this makes it really easy! Detach the bowl from the motor assembly with a short, counter clockwise turn of the wrist, and do the same with the lid (extremely easy, I assure you) -- then dump the coffee from the grinding bowl into your filter, use your finger to agitate the plastic cleaning blade for a second or two to get as much usable coffee out of the bowl as possible, then wash out the bowl with a little water, and dry it with a towel (it is important to dry it immediately to avoid any chance for oxidation) - and you're done! I am not sure why a previous reviewer was using a spoon or scoop to get the coffee out of the bowl -- that's why it detaches from the base! The bowl is marked on the side so you will know what amount of beans to use -- after a few experiments, it is very easy to judge how high to fill it. I just can't understand how it could be more difficult to clean the bowl when it is separate from the base than to clean a grinder that does not detach from the electrical portion...\n\n2.1. if you need to grind your coffee coarsely for a percolator, you should not be buying whole beans - buy your coffee from in large cans from companies that have television commercials and easy-listening jingles, as the end result is going to end up tasting awful, no matter what, if you put it in a percolator.\n\n3. The power cord - other people have addressed this -- the cord is tucked up inside the bottom of the grinder -- simply pull it out, and it is plenty long.\n\n4. Another reviewer said he preferred a different grinder that shuts off automatically -- this grinder does that as well -- put in the beans, choose your settings with the buttons on the side of the unit, and then hold down the grinding button -- continue to hold the button down until the grinder automatically stops -- it will stop when it has achieved the level of grinding that you selected with the buttons.\n\n5. Lights wasting electricity - the reviewer who wrote that the grinder's lights are just wasting electricity is just a sillypants and wants to nitpick. The reality is this: the 2 LEDs that would be lit up while this device is plugged in would draw an almost nominal level of current. At 3.3vac a 100 Watt light bulb uses 30.3 Amps (30,300mA). At 3.3vac each LED would use 20mA -- so, both LEDs would use, at most, 40mA - which is less than 1/750th the amount the 100W bulb would use. You would have to leave the grinder plugged in and turned on for over a full month for the LED lights inside to use the same amount of current (electricity) used by turning on that 100 watt bulb for a single hour.\n\nI have been using this grinder every day for 3 years along with a swissgold coffee filter (if you are still using paper filters you are just wasting trees and missing out on better tasting coffee...) and I have not had a single problem with it -- it grinds the beans consistently to the settings I punch in, and my yield is a delicious pot every morning.\n\nIf you couldn't tell, I am quite happy with this grinder. So buy one already!"

I reckon it does protect my leprechauns from tripping or entangling themselves on that dangerous eight inch power cord as they merrily skip across my kitchen counters at night.\n\nEven Amazon's best seller, theKRUPS F203 Electric Coffee Grinder, has customers complaining of its shortened power cord length (per customer review, reduced from 48 inches to 24 inches). Still, 24 inches is three times the length of a Mr. Coffee power cord and will work for me just fine.

            "reviewText": "As of this writing I have owned this a week. First off my two complaints. The cord is too short. It is less than 12 inches long. I can see some safety reasons why they did this. You cannot actually fill up the container at the front of your counter while it is plugged in. You have to unplug it bring it to where you can reach it to fill and empty then move it to the back of the counter to reach a outlet. If you have other appliances you have to move them to reach. Seriously, the cord is crazy short. I guess this keeps people from grinding their fingers by accident since it becomes a major thing to plug and unplug. Human factors engineering I suppose.. Second thing is the coarse isn't really all that course. I use exclusively a French press and like a really coarse grind. No matter how I do this it always comes out fine. The preset timers is useless. I basically just have to bump it till it looks tight. It has a clear grind chamber so I can see the grind. I suppose if you do a days worth of grinds for a drip coffee maker then this would be ideal but for a small one person French press type of use, this isn't quite right. I will keep using this but I will keep searching for a better one for my type of use. The grind chamber is all steel and so are the blades. The motor pulls strong and shows no sign of struggling. It grinds pretty quick and is not to noisy .... It does make some noise, it IS a grinder. For light sleepers in the house, it might wake them up. The unit has a good bit of heft so I surmise there is a fair amount of metal in the motor and gearing which for a grinder is a good thing."

This blender is still in excellent shape after 4 months use every other day. The cleaning features of this model are especially handy, both to remove the contents easily (detach from motor base and easily pour where you want it) and to actually clean. Being able to put the bowl portion right into the dishwasher is great! We liked the first one so much we bought a second so that we have one in each of our 2 homes - one in US and one in Canada, each for 6 months of the year."

Chamber Maid system thin plastic and likely to give up as in earlier review. Does not clean coffee off the side of the chamber. Cord storage very poor.

For me, this defeats my reason for needing coffee. My other regular home grinder has 2 parts. A person in a coma could easily grind the beans using it.

The smell of hot plastic permeates the entire grinder and the beans become a powdered blend of unevenly ground, burnt, plastic tasting grounds. I recommend spending another $20 on a better grinder - like a burr grinder."

You grind the coffee til you decide to stop. You tip it over to empty it and you can clean the well with your finger, a brush, or a towel. You don't need Mr. Coffee to think for you. Get outta my way, Mr. Coffee, I don't have time to play with you. Give me my simple one-hand operating grinder, and let me take care of the rest myself."

The only thing that the plastic blades intended for wiping the coffee off of the sides are good for is providing more surface area for coffee grounds to stick to. The removable cup and lid only become nuisances to fit back into place. Green lights that reflect the number of cups the maker is set to grind and the current grind setting only make me think that I'm unnecessarily using extra power (granted it's only pennies, but it's still waste). My last simple coffee grinder lasted 15 years. I don't think I'll last 1 year with this one."

You have to continuously hold down the button on the top to get it to operate, unlike other coffee grinders on the market (Cuisinart, for one) where you just set it, start it and walk away. I would never recommend this product to anyone anywhere.

The instructions say it's a safety feature, but it's an annoyance.\n\nWe have a cooking island counter in the kitchen, and can't use it. The cord won't reach from the outlet to the countertop unless we have the grinder perched on the very edge. An extension cord would be silly and hazardous in the kitchen.\n\nSo, take it back and get another brand. Check the cord length before purchasing.

I opened the bottom, thought I got it all out and put the bottom back on, not two days later and more coffee on my counter. All that extra scraping did nothing except maybe buy me a little time.

For some reason, we had not had whole beans at the house because we thought this was going to be too complicated and expensive. We would buy whole beans from a big box warehouse store and grind them there ... this is just too easy though. You set for the amount and the fine/rough grain -- then just press down until it stops. The clean up is easy as well --- just wash in the sink (not in the dishwasher). The cap/top just unscrews really easy and boom; its done. We can tell a difference in our coffee."

The chamber that grinds the beans is easy to screw on and off and washes easily, so water never has to come in contact with the base that includes the motor. I also appreciate the lid that screws on and off and opens to pour out the beans. When I make coffee, I grind the beans, remove the chamber with the top, then shake the chamber with the top closed to make sure none of the grounds are stuck to the bottom.\n\nGreat product for a coffee lover who isn't super serious or technical about grind levels, but likes to grind their coffee every morning. Will work for french press, pour over, or regular drip (e.g. a Mr. Coffee)."

The way the grinding cup works is also a huge plus for us. My husband is partially disabled and has limited mobility and tremors in his left hand. The grinding cup it's lid are easy to put on the grinder unit and take off for him. I had our original grinder (not the Mr. Coffee) in the cupboard as a back up in an emergency. When our previous Mr. Coffee Grinder broke and I was forced to use the old one I HATED IT! The old one did not have the removal grind cup and while trying to pour the grounds from the old grinder into the filter I dropped the entire heavy unit into the coffee maker as the old grinder did not have a removal cup. My husband did the same thing the next day. This grinder is well worth every penny and it is one of the lesser expensive ones."

The old grinding compartment, which survived the heat wave, fits perfectly, so I have two.\n\nI was sorry the chambermaid strips didnt last on my first one. They get narrow near the base,and wore through within a year, I think it was. The new ones are a little stiff to work well, and I dont remember the other ones being that way, so maybe theyll loosen up and then be more durable.\n\nThe compartment and lid are still a bit of a hassle to fit together, but they loosen up with more use.\n\nI had a Krups before, but it also fell to a heatwave. It worked equally well and had a sleek design and nice finish. It definitely beats Mr. Coffee in style and looks (and price) but having to take the whole thing, cord and all, to the sink everyday to clean it was a deal breaker. Oh, and having to turn it upside to get the coffee into the lid before removing it and inevitably spreading coffee dust that had to be wiped upanother deal breaker. Looks and style lost."

That one still works, but the plastic arms that sweep grounds from the sides have broken in a couple of places, and the motor sometimes sounds a little rough. It had almost daily use for years, and has lasted very well, so I bought this same model as a replacement. I am glad I made the same choice. It works great. Grounds are swept from the sides as beans are ground, and the coffee tastes great when brewing with my drip coffee maker. So what do I like? 1) Great tasting coffee from a cost effective grinder, 2) rotating arms that clean grounds from side of container, and 3) automatic settings for number of cups and type of grind - coarse, medium, and fine, and durability. As already mentioned, the motor on my old grinder of the same model is still going strong, though probably the blades may have dulled a bit, and some cleaning out of the older container is required, due to sweeping arms broken in a couple of places (due to overfilling years ago; my fault). The motor on the older one was beginning to sound a little louder lately as well, which I can hardly complain about considering its age. It still proved to me that this Mr. Coffee grinder is the best choice for grinders in this price range."

This arrived this morning so when I got home from work, Immediately washed it, allowed it to air dry with a little wipe around with a paper towel and proceeded to grind about 3tbps of coffee. The coffee grinder grinds more evenly than my manual ever did and plus its programmed to grind for the amount of secs corresponding to the amount of coffee you added and indicated on the device. Not only was my coffee evenly ground in seconds, the brew was a lot smoother than its ever been for the past few months Ive had the manual one. This grinder is easy to clean and assemble. Its small enough that if I left it in my counter I wouldnt be bothered by it, or I could store it in the cabinet. I recommend maybe a fait to weekly clean depending if you prefer to pre grind weekly or daily."

You have to hold the little tab to keep it flipped open when you try to pour it out, which can be a little awkward, and the little ridges around the inside of the lid catch alot of the finely ground powder so to aid this i just end up removing the cup and tapping it on the counter to free and then removing the lid and pouring without it.

Instead of having a smooth bowl to create the nice coffee bean \"whirlpool\" effect, the inside plastic pieces prevent the beans from being ground. I do like the timer, so you can make sure that the grind time is the same each time. The unit comes apart into three pieces and is a little cumbersome. We use it every day and the motor seems fine.

Two small pushbuttons select the amount of beans to grind and the fineness of the result you want, and then you push down on the lid until the grinding stops. So long as the unit is plugged in, it retains its settings. That's very handy for me because I make about the same amount of coffee each morning.\n\nThe two-part top unit (grinding chamber and lid) lifts out easily with a twist. Turning the lid assembly back and forth on the grinding chamber makes three plastic vanes wipe across the inner walls of the chamber so that no coffee sticks there when you empty the coffee into your brewer. Both parts can be machine-washed, a real plus -- especially if you (like me) grind other stuff like hot peppers.\n\nThe is not a real \"grinder\" of course, merely a chopper, so the consistency of the grounds isn't the best; but it seems pretty good.\n\nHOWEVER -- the power cord is ridiculously short. It won't even reach the AC socket directly behind and above my grinder. I have to put the grinder on a box. What were they thinking???\n\nFive stars at this price, less one for the power cord."

In this day when everything seems to come with planned obsolescence, this little thing is well made.\n\nOctober 2013: Returning this to 5 stars. This little thing just keeps chugging. I am so happy with it. Losing the little Chamber Maid Cleaning System was really not a big thing other than a momentary disappointment. But in a world of planned obsolescence, this grinder keeps working like a charm. I love the many stage variable grind it allows because I can use it to grind coffee for French press, pour overs, brewed, and espresso. And we still find that we use substantially less coffee to achieve our preferred flavor than with other grinders.\n\nApril 2011: After 6 months, I had to downgrade my rating because the little Chamber Maid cleaning system crumbled one morning as we ground our coffee. Just broke into several pieces, leaving us with a great grinder, but now without a way to easily clean out the last of the coffee which tends to remain in the grinder and get stale. I realize that for $14.95, I could just purchase another one, but I would have expected it to have lasted at least one year. Planned obsolescence irritates me. Leaving my original review below, because I was thrilled with it until that six month point.\n\nOctober 2010: Read Joseph Marsh's 4 star review of this product to get the whole scoop, but I just had to put my 2 cents worth in. I gave it 5 stars because I'm absolutely ecstatic with it. I've had a small, simple Krups grinder for years, but we wanted something with a larger chamber to grind at least 12 cups at a time. I looked at other brand names, ignoring the \"Mr. Coffee\" for a while thinking I wanted something more sophisticated. ::shakes head:: But I was not happy with the reviews and the prices of \"more sophisticated\" grinders.\n\nWith my little Krups, I was doing a count-the-seconds:shake:count-the-seconds:shake:count-the-seconds routine to get just the right grind. This Mr. Coffee grinder takes all the guess work out of it, and I found we were even using LESS coffee per full pot because of the perfect grind.\n\nI also love the Chamber Maid Cleaning System -- so simple, yet so worth it rather than having to dig out the fine grind with my scoop handle every time as I did with the Krups.\n\nThe removable chamber is great, too. Just neater and handier than having to unplug and drag the whole grinder over to scoop out the coffee.\n\nBest and most fun product I've bought in a long time!!! (Oh, and we're still using the Krups for grinding nuts and spices for which it actually seems better suited.)"

            "reviewText": "I've had this grinder for about a month, and I'm impressed. The last time I ground my own coffee was about ten years ago. I had a blade-type grinder back then too, but it was the old design design, where only the lid came off. The blades and grinding-chamber were built into the motorized base. It was necessary to flip the thing upside-down to get the grounds into the lid/cup. Then, when I'd separate the lid from the base, some portion of grounds would always escape onto the counter. It was so messy and difficult to clean that it wasn't worth grinding my own coffee. This new design seems to work quite well. I have yet to make a mess with the coffee grounds. After grinding the beans, I twist the chamber to remove it from the motorized base. I flip up the lid and pour the grounds into my coffee maker. There is even a built-in component that sweeps the edges of the chamber to dislodge the grounds so I don't have to bang on it to get them out. To activate the sweep, I simply twist the container while pouring the grounds into my coffee maker. After all this, I twist the lid to remove it from the container and tap everything on the edge of my sink to release any lose remnants. All the pieces are clearly marked to make reassembly easy. I put the pieces back together and the grinder sits on my counter all nice & clean.\n\nConsistent grounds -\nThe new design also makes it easy to have a good, consistent grind. The old model had an on/off mechanism - that was it. I never really knew how long to let the thing run. What if I were making 6-cups instead of 12-cups? What if I wanted strong coffee instead of weak coffee? What if I ground the beans too long and made coffee bean dust that clogged my filter and overflowed coffee-soup onto my counter? This new design solves the problem. With a push of a couple of buttons, I can specify how many cups of coffee I'm planning for and whether I want it weak or bold. I haven't compared the grind consistency to that of a burr grinder, but this little thing seems to do a fine job. My understanding is that burr-type grinders provide the best consistency of grounds, but they're more expensive and difficult to clean. I paid $20 for this little guy and it's easy to use and clean.\n\nCleaning -\nThe instructions say the grinding container and lid can be hand-washed or placed on the top rack of the dishwasher. I recommend hand-washing because I had a poor experience with the dishwasher. The container has an inner stainless-steel cup where the beans are ground. Outside of this cup is a clear-plastic housing. When the dishwasher removes food particles from the other dishes, some of the particles become lodged between these two grinder components. To get the food residue out of my grinder container I had to completely disassemble it - rinsing wouldn't get them out. On a positive note, I can say that the grinder container was easily disassembled and reassembled with a #1 Phillips screwdriver. It also gave me an opportunity to evaluate the engineering, manufacturing and assembly of this particular part of the grinder. Overall, I think this grinder is a very good deal for $20.\n\nOnly complaint -\nIf there were one thing I would improve, it would be the on/off switch. The manufacturing and assembly tolerances are pretty good for a $20 grinder. However, a slight difference in tolerances can make a person have to push really hard on the switch to turn on the grinder. In my opinion, the design should have added millimeter on the plunger that activates the switch."

You can grind in three stages, coarse, medium and fine; plus up to 12 cups of coffee, each time and each setting has an automatic timer, so you simply press the on button, keep it pressed, the grinder stops automatically.\n\nI like the fact that the chamber comes apart and can be thoroughly cleaned by hand or in the dish washer, so after a week or so, or when switching to a different type of coffee, I can easily clean and avoid any left overs in the cup.\n\nSome here have complained about the noise, and it is noisy, but not to the extend of what some have said. So, if you are a regulare guy/gal, looking for a decent, fresh cup of coffee and don't want to spend a load of money for some fancy grinder that pretty much does the most basic thing..grind coffee... then look no further, this unit is low priced, works great and lasts.

It works great for your coffee, period. Fine through coarse grinds it does competently. I am not 100% sure what the effects of the cups and coarseness buttons are, but the transparent chamber allows you to keep an eye on the grind with ease and the blades deliver a generally uniform grind (as long as you don't overfill).\n\nCleaning the unit is easy despite the plastic arms inside; quickly washing and wiping clean, the unit dries quickly. The \"Chamber Maid\" arms are a bit unnecessary, but can be semi-effective at releasing some of the ground beans from the walls and foot of the chamber. You could also do this with your finger and break out the arms (some friends of mine with the same grinder have done this and it has not impacted performance).\n\nTypically, you are instructed to keep separate grinders for spices and coffee beans. For someone who regularly grinds all manner of chili and curry powders, the materials used to make the grinder have yet to impart any of those flavors to the beans (assuming a quick cleaning).\n\nAnd by chili powder, I don't just mean grinding allspice berries, but also taking toasted then soaked peppers and pureeing them.

This grinder works well and is a step up from my old grinder, but it does have a few minor issues. The ground coffee is not totally removed by twisting the cap. On the plus side, the cup can be detached and washed without exposing electric components to water. I learned not to overfill the cup with beans. Doing so means an incomplete grind. The grinder does stop when done and seems to do a good job in grinding the beans to the desired fineness setting. The unit defaults to medium settings when unplugged, which I was not aware of until I noticed it later. It's not perfect but I'm happy with it for the price I paid."

Just choose the settings you want, put the coffee beans in, and push the top down until it stops. I think I would use a cheaper, different grinder for grinding spices since they are ground fine and it is difficult to get fine ground things out of this product without spilling quite a bit of it. The coffee gets stuck on three inner seams and the blades, especially when fine ground. Between the seams and the blades, it is difficult to get a spoon or scoop or anything in there to dislodge the stuck-on coffee. Also, it is difficult to keep the top up/open when putting in the beans or taking out the coffee. It keeps falling back down. It grinds the coffee pretty well if you hold the lid down until it stops grinding. Yes, YOU have to hold the lid down to make it grind, but it only takes a few seconds."

I feel like it unlocked more flavors than my old grinder did.\n\nCons: cord is a hassle to unwind and rewind, pain to wash, and the first time I used it, I noticed after I had brewed my coffee that there were still a few wholes beans in the grounds. Also, though there's a choice for how many cups to make, they want you to measure out the grounds afterwards, which means (if you're a coffee snob like me) if there's any leftover grounds, they'll be thrown away.\n\nOverall, for the price, it's pretty good. My old burr grinder was around $75, so I'm not expecting perfection out of this."

People were even worried about getting cancer from consuming the powdered plastic. Well the coffee grinder works great and fast, plenty of cord wrapped around the bottom, just unwind it. As for the cancer from the plastic, think of all the chemicals being sprayed on the bean itself during it's maturing to keep bugs from eating them. 80% of all coffee comes from 3rd world countries and they spray the heck out of them so who cares if the plastic slowly goes away?\n\nEnjoy your grinder and coffee!\n\nUpdate as of 02-Feb-12, one year later.\n\nThis little grinder is an absolute maniac, I use it all the time and since day one it will rip those helpless coffee beans to pieces perfectly every time. The plastic scraper is showing a little wear but this is not really a problem. If you enjoy fresh ground coffee everyday and don't want to spend hundreds of dollars then buy this one. I know it will never let you down. I really enjoy mine.\n\nLast Update 03/09/2013\n\nStill grinding strong, you have to get one today!"

I thought I'd try something different so I bought the Mr. Coffee ISD77 with Chamber Maid Cleaning.\n\nOK..I used the grinder 3 times and I've now ordered a new Krups to replace it.\n\nPros: It looks nice and it appears that it has some neat features\n\nCons: Poor Design\nThe \"features\" don't work right or are just on the \"ridiculous side\"\n\nHere's what I mean. First the design. The Mr. Coffee is circular in shape. No matter how long you grind, you get some beans that are turned into powder, others that are in chunks...that's because in a circle, there is not the same colliding of particles as in an oval shape or some other shape that simply spins in a circle.\n\nOn the Krups Fast Grind, the shape the grinder is an oval. This forces the beans into odd patterns and the grinds are much more uniform.\n\n\"Chamber Maid\"...it sounds like a good idea. In practice it doesn't work well. Some grounds do in fact fall off of the sides when you move the prongs, but others stay stuck, not to mention those that stick into the top of the grinder.\n\nI thought the lift-off top would be great. But it just turned out to be too many parts. The Krups is two part: Top and bottom with motor. The Mr. Coffee is 3 parts and the advantage is supposed to be that you can subject it to the dishwasher. I'd recommend the Krups and just use a brush to get some of the left over grounds out of it's base.\n\nThe Mr. Coffee is going into the garage sale pile."

This 'cleaning system' interferes with coffee grinds so it actually takes longer to get the grind you want. I had to run the 'fine' cycle twice to actually get a fine grind. Since the coffee grinds can't move freely around the grinding chamber - they fly everywhere inside and actually wind up getting spread all over the lid and lid/cup edge so when you open the lid, grinds fall all over your counter.\n\nThe 'cleaning system' doesn't actually do much and is rather hard to turn if you grind your coffee fine. The grinds get stuck under the plastic ring and it doesn't turn smoothly.\n\nPlain and simple this is a poorly designed product. Yes it grinds coffee but there are other blade grinders that do just as good of a job, that are less messy and can easily be cleaned with a simple wipe of a paper towel in the grinding chamber.\n\nReturned."

The reason for my purchase was we received a Keurig Coffee maker as a Christmas gift and I felt it was too expensive to buy those small cups of coffee and wanted to just use the coffee I like to use right out of a can that I always used in our regular coffee maker. Problem was the coffee grounds right out of the coffee can were too coarse for the Keurig Coffee maker and the hot water runs right through them making a weak cup of coffee so I run the canned coffee once again through my Mr.Coffee Grinder. I then put the newly ground coffee in to a couple of small containers to store the coffee to use in the Keurig Coffee Machine to last for a couple of weeks. The grinder itself is very easy to clean so it isn't really much work at all and I now get a good cup of coffee when I feel I only want a cup or two instead of making a whole pot the old way."

This grinds and the blade unit/cup detaches - for easy pour, frig, clean; no rinsing the unit with motor intact. The design allows for easy cleaning; you can scrape sides even without a brush The GRIND can be a smooth fine espresso - I've even dusted my chocolate candies it's so nice. .I had another unit and it could grind to 'drip' ; nothing finer.

One of these is a paper coffee filter. It filters to coffee. As long as it doesn't crumble into pieces or have a giant hole in it, I am happy. I used to think a coffee grinder was one of these things. From my perception, I thought a coffee grinder would either work or not work, and there wasn't anything special about one over the other, but Mr. Coffee managed to make a simple product into something extraordinary.\n\nThis coffee grinder has three features that are completely revolutionary compared to my older blade grinders:\n\n1) The section with the beans comes off so you can pour it into the pot. This seems like something so obvious. After all, blenders have done this for years. Yet coffee companies consistently make us try and figure out how to make the grounds jump from the grinder to the pot. This one has the top section pull off from the base so you can pour it.\n\n2) The chamber maid system. It really isn't a cleaning system, it is a functional system (And something I would love to see on a blender). Basically you turn the cap back and forth and plastic edges knock all the grounds off the side so that they pour into the pot easily. For anyone that has tried to figure out how to get the coffee from the bottom section on the side by the blade, you know this is a revolutionary change from the norm.\n\n3) The grinding process. With this grinder you set it to how many cups you want and how coarse you want the grounds. Then you add the amount of coffee you said you were going to on the grinder, and hold it down. When it shuts off, the coffee is finished. It comes out even, and it comes out the thickness that I said I wanted. This is great since I own both a coffee maker and an espresso maker that require different levels of coarseness of the grounds.\n\nOverall I love it and the best part is that it is also cheaper than most grinders on the market!!!"

I find the scraper inside to be great help to get those grinds that want to just felt against the inside...loosens them up and gets them out. Variable speeds and its nice looking! Extra convenient is the cord storage underneath. NO it has a long cord...those that think its short is because they didn't take it out of the storage underneath! Great value, valuable product."

            "reviewText": "We received this as a wedding gift. We have used it several times with Tully's whole bean and Eight O'Clock colombian whole bean coffees. We use the \"do not overfill\" guideline to pulse the beans to a medium ground because we use a drip coffeemaker. We have not had any problems with this product so far. It is easy to wash and makes grinding simple and easy. It is suitable for a household of 2-3 adults. If you are trying to grind coffee for a large amount of people, I would suggest buying a larger grinder. This only makes enough for 8-10 cups of coffee at a time, depending on the strength you desire. We like our coffee medium strong, so we use about 4-6 tablespoons per 6-8 cups. The only thing I would say I have noticed that may be a downer is that sometimes after pulsing the beans there will be like ONE single bean left un-ground. Otherwise, we love this product and enjoy using it."

Based on reviews this sounded like a great grinder and it does have some very nice features, like the removeable grinding chamber that allows you to pour the grounds into the filter or pot, without needing to pick up the whole machine. The \"Chamber Maid\" is also a nice feature to scrape the grounds off the side of the chamber. But it is still a blade grinder and as such, some coffee gets ground into dust, which leaves mud in the bottom of your cup if your using a press pot or a single cup drip maker like Bodum's Solo. I also found the \"automatic\" feature, which you can set to grind anywhere from 4-12 cups either Course, Medium or Fine, useless. Again, I wanted a course grind for my press pot, but set for 4 cups and course grounds, it ground my beans medium to fine, before shutting down. So it is back to grinding until it \"sounds right\" and using my 4 cup drip coffee maker with a paper filter, which takes away some of the taste, but results in mud-free cups of coffee."

With the Mr. Coffee IDS77 Electric coffee grinder, it takes the guessing out of the equation, giving you a great grind each and every time. The grinding chamber is removable from the motor assembly, so you can easily remove the residual grinds to your press/machine (the Chamber Maid Cleaning System really does assist with this effort, believe it or not). Also, since it's removable and is dishwasher friendly, cleaning it periodically is rather simplified. Finally, the fact that the grinding chamber is removable only adds to the fact that you can safely (and I emphasize the word SAFE) remove all of your grinds without worrying whether you accidentally turn it on at the same time. To further the safety feature, the access lid must be closed completely in order to turn it on in the first place.\n\nI've had a grinder in times past, but always felt that it was difficult to determine when to stop it from grinding. With my old grinder (that I haven't used for years and is either in a landfill somewhere or lost in a box stuffed away in our basement), I would either get the grinds too fine or not enough. Depending on whether I was grinding for a drip machine, or just a simple French Press, it was difficult to get the grind just right.\n\nTo summarize, this is a great product, loaded with innovative and safety features which earn it a five star rating from me.\n\nPepperman"

This one seemed to fit the bill: Less expensive, larger grinding volume, quieter, longer lasting, etc.\n\nWell, I was disappointed with it. It took what seemed forever to grind the beans to the fine consistency necessary for our machine. Then, after grinding about two cups of beans (we keep a few days worth of the ground beans in an airtight container), it completely stopped working. I am not sure if it was defective or just not capable of grinding properly. I am thinking it was the latter.\n\nI sent it back and am not taking a chance on another one of these.

(as much as a blade grinder can)\n-The finer, dust-like, particles get stuck in the \"Chamber Maid Cleaning System\" which means less silt in my cup of french press.\n\nCons\n-The \"Chamber Maid Cleaning System\" is a joke. It's a plastic scraper that sweeps the bottom of the chamber when you take the lid off, and still doesn't get everything. A firm thump with the palm of your hand is more effective for emptying the chamber.\n-(See-Pros) The fine particles that get stuck in the cleaning system would mean a bit of unnecessary waste for filtered drip brewers.\n-It's construction does not allow it to dry easily, which results in clumping if you don't dry it thoroughly on your own after cleaning.\n-The flip-top on the lid seems unnecessary, and sometimes grinds get stuck in there.\n\nCriticisms aside, I love this grinder."

Another bonus is the automatic stop after some time has lapsed based on your settings on kind of grinding and number of cups. You can stop it earlier but this feature prevents you from grinding too long.\n\nThe look is nice and goes well on the counter top as it has some hi-tech air.\n\nRegarding the noise I didn't find any difference when compared to others.

It has multiple volume (cups) and grind selections, but I simply set it once and once it worked exactly as I wanted, then forgot it, as most will. There's some innovation to the lid, as well, which works fine for delivering the beans and emptying the ground coffee. One innovation I had doubts about was a \"cleaning\" feature, plastic blades that \"sweep\" the grinder's bowl-- if you like Dark Roast as we do, you know there's always a sticky residue impossible to get out of your grinder.

There are no chunks left after grinding. There might be some coffee fallout when I transfer to the coffeemaker, but I've never seen a coffee grinder that did otherwise. I keep it handy rather than stuck away on a top shelf."

It will grind everything at every setting into a nice fine powder - not good for drip makers, and certainly bad for presses. I want press coffee, so I tried using manual control to stop and start the blades, even pulsing a bit to try to get good distribution of consistently sized grains. There was nothing I could do to get this. Every time there was a distribution of fine powder along with big chunks. Actually kind of par for the course with blade grinders, but I was expecting more with all the fancy controls. Just a blade grinder, and not bad for the price if you prefer espresso."

This one lets you select fine, medium or coarse which is all I need. More expensive models have more choices, most of which would never be used so why pay for them?\n\nIt's very easy to use. The manual tells you how many tablespoons of coffee to use depending on how many cups you are making and what grind to use depending on what kind of coffeemaker you use. Of course, you can adjust the amount to your taste. The unit lets you select the grind and number of cups and grinds accordingly... stopping automatically at the appropriate time depending on your selections.\n\nThe real test for me is not having any grinds in the last cup I pour from the pot. So far I've only tried the medium grind for my automatic drip coffeemaker. Perfect.\n\nCleanup is easy too. All in all, a great buy for the money."

Both buttons are completely worthless. They serve no function other than to give the false sense of comfort that you are customizing your grounds.\n\nSecondly, this this is SO incredibly loud and obnoxious I have to let me family know before I use it else someone's gonna get startled. Loud and obnoxious sound permeate the kitchen and all of its vicinity.\n\nThird, this goes back to my first point of the useless setting buttons. The grounds will come fine (very fine) regardless of setting. I've tried dozens of times with different beans and setting and always, always, always it completely pulverizes the beans back to their carbon pre-historic origins.\n\nIt's cheap, but you get what you pay for. I'm currently looking for a reasonably priced Burr-method grinder. But this thing it's a pretty horrible product."

NOW. Please read my full review.\nAnd I only gave 3 stars because it has the shortest electrical cord in the history of cords - seriously this cord is 4 inches long and it states that you are not to plug into any extension cords. I mean come on we need at least 8 inches, not everyone is accommodated with perfect plug installation.\nWell below I rec'd a reply explaining \"where's the cord\" LOL...to my surprise the cord is about 26-28\" long tightly wound hidden in the bottom.

But, after lots of reading reviews and research, I settled for this inexpensive little guy. I have had it a month now and am very pleased with it. It has settings for the amount of beans you are grinding along with the type of grind you want(coarse, medium, fine). I have been very pleased with the job it does and it's definitely a good buy for the money!"

I found that there is more cord VERY tightly wrapped around the interior of the base. Mystery solved!!I love flavored coffee so the fact that you can wash the grinder cup is FANTASTIC. The \"cleaning system\" does'nt scrape the bottom so I just use a pasrty brush to get all of the grounds out. The pour spout is not that great coffee tends to stick to the ridges on the inside of the pour spouts top, so again the trusty pastry brush to the rescue. It's noisy and scares the dog but most grinders are thats the nature of the beast. All in all this is a great little grinder,and for a clean freak like myself.... perfect."

It's great! It grinds coffee the specification you set and all the parts are removable for a quick wash. The cord is short, but this is not an issue for us. We keep it right next to the coffee maker unplugged and plug it in when we are ready to use it. I would highly recommend this product."

The drive has a mechanical fit similar to a blender, so the grinding chamber can be removed and is easy to clean.\n\nAt this price, you can't go wrong if you're looking for a decent grinder, or are wanting to start grinding your own beans.\n\nThe Bad:\n\n- Fill as you-use. No hopper to retain beans and dispense the correct amount for grinding--you must measure each time.\n- Grind settings. The grind settings adjust the grind duration based on the programmed number of cups to grind, and the coarseness desired. I find that the unit I have tends to grind the beans more finely than I'd prefer.\n- Lid fit. The top lid fits over the grinding chamber, and doesn't want to easily mate with the chamber. It is necessary to get the proper fit, since the grinding button is a pass through on the lid that must be held down until the unit finishes grinding. You may release it early if desired.\n\nOverall, the easy-to-clean nature of the unit overcomes it's shortcomings, since having clean surfaces is very important to making the best coffee."

While it does grind coffee pretty well without a lot of large pieces of beans left behind, it is very awkward to use. The top does twist, swiping much of the built-up ground coffee off the plastic inside. But not all. Pouring the grounds out is beyond awkward, the plastic top doesn't swing fully open, so you balance the opened top, holding it upside down, & shaking it into the filter. Not that easy. The entire top cup unit does come off. BUT - it is not easy to get back onto the base itself!! I got so frustrated, I stick to just flipping the whole thing upside down. Two other annoyances: 1.where the cord exits the bottom of the unit it is made so the cord refuses to stay in the plastic notch it is supposed to. So it is always unbalanced & sitting on its own cord. 2. I absolutely hate the annoying lights that are always on, to show the selections for number of cups. It's criminal to waste electricity on a nuisance light, I unplug this thing every day it because this annoys me so much."

            "reviewText": "5-stars for being the best bladed coffee-grinder I've used. I certainly can't say it's completely consistent, like pretty much any burr grinder would give you, however, I have discovered that if I set the amount of grounds one-step higher than the actual amount (say I put in 6-cups worth, I'll set it to grind 8-cups), I get a much more consistent grind I haven't noticed an issue with powered beans passing the paper filter; a permanent/gold filter may be more prone to this.\nI really appreciate that it will automatically turn off, all I have to do is hold the button until it turns off. But in my experience, setting the amount to the actual amount leaves a handful of half and quarter beans which is a complete waste.\n\nAt $18, this is the best budget bean grinder purchase you can make. Recommended if you're cheap like me.\n\nTwo things I don't like that may be worth noting:\n The cord... it's maybe 2-feet long, tops.\n The green lights stay on when plugged in, there is no off button, so I only plug it in while in use."

You just move grab the top of the insert and move in a circle and you wil see little indivual piles of coffee where the plastic nodules used to be. I like it I think!\n\nThe timer didn't gind 6 cups on \"fine\" fine. It was more like course. It takes somewhere about 50 seconds to a minute to grind beans fine. It might depend on what type of beans it is too. Anyways, ignore the timer.\n\nThe blade doesn't look that good. I wish it was better.\n\nI perfer a plastic bowl to a stainless steel bowl.

            "reviewText": "I purchased this for use with a French press coffeemaker, which requires coarsely-ground beans. Despite using the \"coarse\" setting on the Mr. Coffee grinder, it produced very inconsistent results. By the time most of the beans are at least coarsely-ground, half of them have already been pulverized to dust, which tends to clog the wire mesh in the French press. I returned the Mr. Coffee to Amazon for a refund."

I haven't used the auto timer yet but will update that in a future post. My only gripe is that the grinds stick every where in the container so I am constantly trying to brush it out after every use but it always seems to build along the bottom where the plastic holders are for the blade. It is a bit of a pain but once again it doesn't affect the usefulness of this item. Over all works great and for the price it is way better than a manual grinder. I would recommend."

            "reviewText": "I wanted to like this coffee grinder... The different settings seemed handy and I liked the little plastic pieces inside the cup that help scrape out coffee grounds. But it's just a terrible mess. Even after checking to make sure the pieces were secured, every time I pressed down to grind the coffee, the grinder would scoot across the counter, spitting excess grounds out the sides and all over the counter. This isn't really the biggest problem, though. The biggest issue is that pressing down on that tiny button in an awkward place is very painful for my hand and wrist, sending nasty shooting pains all the way up through my fingers almost to my elbow within a few seconds of pressing down. So even without the obnoxious shaking and mess, I stopped using this immediately. I can't use a coffee grinder that hurts!\nI don't know if I somehow got a faulty device or what, but it's almost like the motor used is far too powerful for the little plastic device and so it vibrates too intensely.\nSo unfortunately I really can't recommend this grinder. It has neat features but it just isn't well designed."

We use it to grind our coffee beans. 1/2 cup of beans on the 6-cup coarse setting works great for our French press.\n\nThe chambermaid cleaning system is a gimmick; haven't found it to be all that helpful. I still have to rinse out the bowl and wipe it down really well with a paper towel to get all the risidual grinds out.\n\nMy only concern with the grinder that docks it a star is that the plastic feels very thin and cheap. Everything works great and nothing has broken, but it does feel fragile. To remove the bowl and lid, both have to be twisted to unlock it. It just feels like if you twist too roughly, it could break or crack. Time will tell.\n\nFor the grind options, I think this is worth the price."

Not worth the effort to return it so I will eat the $20. This is why I dislike it: the green leds do not shutoff, you have to unplug it; after you grind the coffee and try to empty it, a lot is left stuck on the bottom; the 'grind' button sometimes sticks, and you think it is broken; it is taller than my old Braun and is somewhat unwieldy. Don't need any issues with a grinder, just want it to be quick and easy."

As you have to hold the button down the entire time it grinds, you will probably need an extension cord or you must stand CLOSE to an outlet. My biggest complaint.\nThe Chamber Maid Cleaning System is mediocre and just a bit functional. Not a real selling point and shouldn't have been used in the name of the product as such. I use a brush from an old system to get it all out,\nIt does a good job at grinding. If that is all you're interested in, go for."

It is more convenient to have one for coffee and another for spices and not worry about spice after taste sip in your coffee. The top and mixing container twists off and there are several degrees of mixing you can dial on the body. It is easy to wash and clean the top and mixing container without worrying about the motor since they separate from body where motor is housed."

Some things need LEDs; a coffee mill doesnt.\n\nIt grinds the coffee well enough, tho you have to stand there holding the button down till the timer stops it, which sort of defeats the point of having a timer, no? The press n' pour lid . . . designed with a wide opening for easy filling and dispensing with less mess just gets in the way & its a pain in the a** to clean out. I was especially disappointed with the chamber maid cleaning system I chose it for tho.\n\nAdmittedly Im fussy, but any ground coffee left in the bowl quickly gets stale & adds its stale flavor to my next grind, so I want it clean. The chamber maid consists of a set of three rotatable plastic splines curving along the inside surface of the bowl. Probably works pretty good with a coarse blend, but a fine blend like I use gets in under the splines, making it that much harder to get the bowl really clean. Oh well, it was a nice concept & worth a try. At least the bowls removable & thats an improvement over the old kind."

I washed it per instructions and place of hearts in the drainer. 6 + a half hours later I want to reassemble in use but... The parts still were not dry. Myself and my co-workers were sent home halfway through our shift because trucks were delayed due to the weather. I got home more than 10 hours after the package arrived and there was still moisture between the large button on top and the lid. If you are someone that likes fresh ground coffee a couple of times a day, as my family and I do, this is not the grinder for you. That is unless you enjoy cleaning damp coffee grounds out of every crevice of the machine. Very very disappointing"

Many people posted about the longer cord stored underneath the grinder at the bottom, I assumed it was one where you could pull out the cord, but you have to actually unwrap it so be aware of that.\nThese things last forever! The old one I broke, I accidentally got water on the base part, and it seemed to shut it down. I tried it again today before throwing it out after getting a new one, and IT'S WORKING AGAIN! Which is great, because now I have two grinders!\nThis thing works great for spices and coffee. I've read reviews that it works great even for pesto and other types of thicker pastes! I'll try that out soon. I would definitely purchase this again\nPrice: $15.99"

            "reviewText": "After the first use it was apparent this coffee bean grinder did not live up to its hype. The flip-up lid has to be held open to dispense the grounds or the top must be removed entirely and its not that easy to put back on when one is half awake. The blade takes up so much space in the bowl that its difficult to extract all the grounds with a scoop or spoon. The plastic device that \"cleans\" the bowl does nothing that I could not do with my finger. The grinder has to be unassembled in 3 parts to actually clean the bowl (remove the lid piece, remove the center piece, and wipe the bottom compartment). Its also not as quiet as the advertising would lead you to believe. I already own a GE model grinder that has is a lock-tite lid and a grinder bowl, which works just fine. The GE model also has a grind setting from coarse for percolators to fine for expresso. It also has an automatic switch that shuts the unit off. GE model cost $9.95 versus $30 plus for the Mr. Coffee model. Recommendation: Go with less expensive model and spend money on good coffee beans."

I purposely watched this one, in case it had the same problem and when it started overheating I unplugged it before it caught fire to. I reported this to Amazon and they are doing an investigation. I implore all of you considering this grinder, PLEASE do not leave it plugged in unattended until you know it isn't from the same batch. I love this grinder and have had one for several years that is the same make and model, which works great. That's why I bought another one for work, because I was happy with the one I have at home."

Since I cannot live without a grinder and am in the burbs here, I went to Walmart to get a coffee grinder. The only two on the shelf were guess what? Mr Coffee, the POS model that just failed me and this flashy POS. Well I didn't want to buy this but of the two it had to be this because I couldn't bring myself to buy another of the one that just broke!\n\nOver designed - meaning many useless \"features\" - why have 3 grind levels when they all do THE SAME GRIND??? Why have a bunch of LIGHTS to use electricity when NO ONE GRINDS ANYTHING IN THE DARK... Why have a piece of plastic in the middle that doesn't help remove the contents - no it just gets in the way when replacing the lid. The short cord means you have have to unplug it and move the thing to the place where you need to dump out the contents. And oh THE LID, well whatever you are grinding, A LARGE AMOUNT of it will end up on this WAY OVER DESIGNED LID and YOU WILL NEED A BRUSH of some sort to clean that lid because the fool that designed it put a LOT OF CREVICES on the inside of the lid.\n\nIn short I HATE THIS POS AND THE OTHER POS GRINDER FROM MR COFFEE."

They made me nervous, but I didn't have an issue.\n\nLast night, I ground some spices, and starting mixing them into the meal I was making. I was startled to notice little specks of black. I looked in the grinder, and sure enough, the black plastic had broken and been grinded along with the spices. I was horrified. At least what I was grinding was light colored, had it been coffee, I'm not sure I would've noticed the plastic in it.\n\nI find this to be hazardous. It may work well for a few years, but the design is flawed. After a number of grindings, it will eventually break.\n\nI replaced it with a grinder that doesn't have ridges or plastic in the grinding bowl."

The settings dont seem to correlate to much of anything. Coffee sticks to the sides. You have to disassemble the whole thing to get the grinds out. It is not ergonomic. I can't just push the grind button and walk away (what is the point of the automatic shutoff and settings then?) I get coffee grinds EVERYWHERE, a problem I didn't experience for a decade of heavy coffee drinking. Its cord storage is convenient (I suppose?), but still doesn't compare to what I had. I am probably going to try returning this awful little lump of disappointment and frustration and spending a little more to get something that doesn't fill me with rage before my first cup of coffee. Or I will just try to use my beloved, mostly broken old grinder."

            "reviewText": "This coffee grinder was an impulse purchase and I was fully prepared to return it because I didn't expect it to work as advertised. To my astonishment, the darned thing actually does a pretty good job. I have tried several coffee grinders over the years and have ended up giving all of them away to friends and family. I gave up on burr grinders because they are messy, hard to clean, produce a bitter powder, and are so noisy you almost need earplugs to use them. The blade grinders I have tried produced an inconsistent grind size and you have to experiment with the number of seconds it takes to get the grind right for the quantity of coffee you want to make. If you want to make more cups or less, you have to experiment all over again with the number of seconds you need to grind the beans. I ended up just having the coffee shop grind my Kenya AA beans for me and I buy smaller amounts so the coffee won't go stale before I can use it all.\n\nThis Mr.Coffee grinder is the only one I've ever tried that I think I can live with. First of all, this is a $19.95 grinder and not a $300 precision instrument designed to produce a perfect cup of expresso. Within those parameters, it does a really good job. The electronic grind and cup quantity settings take all of the guess work out of using a blade grinder. With this grinder, you use the guide on the side of the unit to measure your beans, choose a grind setting and the number of cups of coffee you want to make and a processor apparently calculates everything for you. You just hold the grind button down and the machine turns itself off after the correct number of seconds. No grind time experimentation is needed and the machine seems to get the grind just right all by itself. Cleanup is a snap, just remove the bowl from the base unit and put it on the top rack of your dishwasher. The ground coffee is actually easier to empty from the bowl than with most blade grinders. Rather than having to turn the entire unit upside down and shaking the grounds into your coffeemaker, you just remove the grinder bowl, turn it upside down in a small plastic bowl, and tap it against the counter to get the coffee out.\n\nThe reviewer who complained about the short cord length apparently did not realize there is 3 feet of hidden cord wrapped around the inside of the base of the unit. All you have to do is pull it out.\n\nWhile durability must be proven over time, I'm most impressed with this $19.95 grinder. Even if it only lasts for 2 years, you could afford to buy 30 of them for what a small professional grade burr grinder would cost and it's actually easier to live with than the pro grade grinder would be."

No matter what setting I used I got, approximately 1/3 fine, 1/3 medium, and 1/3 coarse grinds. I double checked the setup and requested help from product support. No joy. I dumped the Krupp and went back to my Mr. Coffee.\n\nIn the past I had an old style hand mill with adjustable burrs that gave perfect grinds, but it was an 1890's style and made a large mess in the catch drawer and took up a huge amount of counter space.\n\nMy experience with electric burr grinders is that they have too much speed and not enough torque. Granted, my experience is dated. A lower speed allows the ground coffee particles to fall through instead of being swept up and reground finer. A higher torque keeps it from jamming.\n\nAfter 10 years my grinder finally bought the farm and I'm replacing it with a similar model Mr. Coffee. Yes, it does leave a few unground beans, but not many, and the grounds are at least more uniform in size. Can't beat it for the price."

            "reviewText": "Ive owned two of these and overall they are a good coffee grinder, albeit with a persistent flaw. First of all, to get a good grind the approach is one of pulse-shake-pulse. Trying to get a good grind without pausing to shake results in unground beans left in the middle of the hopper. (This is a consistent problem with blade type gronders.) Forget the timer features, just pulse and shake until you get the grind you want.\n\nThe flaw comes in the wiper assembly in that over time the plastic blades of the wiper break, thus inhbiting the wiper feature that helps to loosen the ground coffee from the bowl. That having been said, the wiper feature is really handy for loosening the grounds from the bowl. The bowl is detachable, which is a huge plus in that you can pour the grounds out over the kitchen sink, thus keeping stray grounds off off of the countertop. The bowl is also washable. These two features put this grinder heads and shoulders above the similarly priced K brand grinder, which I also own and find to be messy, inconvenient to get the grounds out of, and also is not submersible.\n\nThe washable bowl feature allows this grinder to do double duty as a spice grinder with no lingering aftertaste problems as the bowl can be easily washed out with some dish detergent and water."

After that it would not run but the lights were still on. Did a little research and discovered that a variety of kitchen appliances have a thermal fuse in line with the motor to prevent it from burning out in case of overheating/loading. Once I took it apart I found the culprit hidden under some tape in line with the motor. I removed it and bypassed it to test and sure enough it came back on. I have ordered a similar thermal fuse (higher temperature and amperage) since I intend to use it more heavily. At this price I suspect people won't bother with it but I like fixing stuff. I will add pictures to assist anyone willing to try."

Not sure if anyone has that issue but regardless of it breaking, the grinder still works. The plastic inside the cap works like a brush to loosen up the coffee grounds. I wish its sturdier. It would be nice if theres a brush included with the machine. Now ... the auto shut off functionality, I havent really paid attn to it. I just use my own judgement. The cap is removable making it easier to transfer the coffee ground to a container and for easier clean up. The size is perfect. The cap is bigger. You can make more coffee compared to other smaller brands of coffee grinder. So I cant complain much. The grinder doesnt cost a lot. Its not an expensive grinder. It has a full year replaceable warranty fr the company and they are very easy to talk to."

But I would up returning it as defective.\n\nWhile it worked, I liked the choice of Coarse/Medium/Fine settings, and the slightly larger than average 'bowl' capacity for the beans.\nI didn't like that the contact on-off switch seemed temperamental (and may have been defective out of the box).\nCompared to some other brands, the design of the hinged top makes it a little more awkward than most to pour the ground coffee into a receptacle.\n\nI was pleased with the Fine grind results during the brief period it worked.\n\nAfter this failed I tried the Hamilton Beach coffee grinder, which I have also reviewed. That Hamilton Beach unit is more basic, and I wound up returning the Hamilton Beach also and getting the KRUPS grinder as my final choice.

The grind uniformity leaves a lot to be desired! Some is powdered and some is big \"sharp\"? looking shards. Washing it is ridiculous with the plastic arms also. Just not a fan of them at all. I've never had a problem with coffee or spices or oatmeal or anything sticking to the sides of the one I have now so I wonder why you even need to have them? Is it because it's a cheapy plastic?

An excellent improvement is the longer cord, which was much needed. However, this model is inferior with respect to grinding. After the grinding cycle is complete, unground and partially ground beans remain. This never happened before. Naturally, I'm not a happy coffee drinker."

            "reviewText": "I LOVE this grinder! I read reviews where people complain about the little plastic arms in the bowl that swivel to help clean out the coffee after a good grind. The blades do not reach the arms but at the beginning of the grind, I imagine that the hard coffee beans wear it down as they spin against them. Is there possibly a tiny bit of plastic bits in my grind? Perhaps. I feel like theres a LOT worse crap we put in our mouths. While I don't believe this is acceptable, and maybe it would still be a great grinder without this feature, perhaps some stainless arms would be better? I don't know, I don't design coffee grinders.\nMy previous grinder we switched to a non-coffee grinder and it would get a rancid smell in it from grinding flax seeds. It did NOT have a removable grinder cup and was extremely hard to keep clean since it was not submersible in water. I threw it out. It looked exactly like this one but I don't believe it was a Cuisanart brand. -> http://www.amazon.com/Cuisinart-DCG-20BK-Coffee-Grinder-Black/dp/B00004S9CY/ref=sr_1_98?s=home-garden&ie=UTF8&qid=1434386784&sr=1-98&keywords=coffee+grinder. But it was fine if it never needed to be cleaned and was only used for one kind of coffee only. ie. husband hates \"flavored\" coffee so we could not use it to grind it without leaving the flavor in it.\n\nI AM in the market for a second grinder at the moment. While this is easy to clean and use for other things like spices or powdering granulated sugar etc., because it gets used every day for coffee and rarely gets washed, it's kind of a pain to rinse it out right before you need it to powder something that needs to stay dry. I HAVE used it to powder sugar as well. It had a teeny bit of coffee flavor but we didn't mind. Honestly, I was not very meticulous about cleaning it that day. I've had this for about 4+ years and still works like new but the little swiveling arms have worn quite thin in the area of the blades, however they have not broken. I also bought one for my sister and she loves it too.\n\nI will be trying a different grinder to use only for non-coffee items, in the name of \"product testing\". ;) Probably will go with this one -> http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JFHHMN2/ref=ask_ql_qh_dp_hza"

My only problem with this (and this is a biggggg problem) is the nooks and crannies that you can't clean out . . . even with a brush. Like, a good grinder should be perfectly cleaned with a brush, you shouldn't have to wash it. Unfortunately, this Mr. Coffee needs to be disassembled and washed when you want it cleaned because there's grooves in it you can't reach with a brush. Hence the coffee builds up in there and gets stale. This is a huge design flaw and it's a giant pet peeve.\n\nHonestly, I think most of the reviews on this site are written by people who are relatively new to making slow coffee (pour overs, french press) - and I say this because I'm surprised no one else has voiced the same concern . . . which might be due to lack of exposure to coffee making? I don't know. Maybe they're fine washing the thing every week or so.\n\nFortunately, this was a gift so I'm not too upset. But I would never personally buy this grinder. I mean - it does the job, grinds the beans alright. Although personally, I like the KRUPS grinder - it's quieter, the grinder time is manual, not automated, so you are in control of how ground you want your beans. I think that would be the smart choice if you want quality for affordability. More than likely I'll be replacing this grinder with the KRUPS."

It's the gift that keeps on giving.) Yes, I know the burr-grind is a preferred method, but after being given a relatively reputable brand burr grinder for a Christmas present many years ago that failed 6 months in, for the price I was happy with the plain ole Krups blade grinder. After a later-evening work shift ended I received a ZOMGCOFFEEGRINDERDEADGETANEWONENOW text message, and had to resort to grabbing the Mr Coffee grinder due to limited retail choices open at that time that might carry the Krups. This Mr Coffee grinder does the job. The pretty lights - beyond the initial 'Oo, pretty lights' phase - and the function they are meant to illustrate aren't much more than 'Oo, pretty lights'. I grind with an eye on the beans until they have the appearance that is best for drip machines. Any automated grinding is useless to me. *However*, being able to remove the cup to dump the grind into the brewer basket is nice - so, there's that. I don't hate it. It does what I need it to. We've had it for three years, I think - again, fair for the price - but when it dies I am not married to replacing it with the same grinder."

But if you love coffee like I do, spend a bit more money for an electric grinder with a removable metal bowl.

It's a bit messy when the top comes off if it's at the full 12 cup capacity. Two months later, it's very finicky when it wants to actually work; sliding them into place, nothing happens, so the cup has to be pushed a little one way, the lid a little another way, and keep fiddling until it starts.

            "reviewText": "I've found this grinder very capable for my weekend coffee for about eight years running. The grind and yield selectors are designed well so I only need to press each button once (I usually grind beans for 4 cups/coarse); the timer in the grinder gives me exactly what I want. The bowl and lid wash easily in the dishwasher (I give them a quick rinse in the sink first) and the cord-wrap in the base holds enough cord properly to reach my outlet and still store neatly in the cupboard. The indicator lights are easy to view and the unit doesn't show much wear after years of use. I'm also satisfied in the size--it's about the same size as a 16 fl oz travel mug. The grinding chamber is clear plastic with a stainless steel liner about 1/3 way up the side--this keeps the unit from becoming opaque plastic as this area is adjacent to the grinding blade where grounds would scour plastic (a very keen design choice).\n\nMy only complaint (but not serious enough to dissuade buyers) is the bowl-scraping \"ChamberMaid\" system--while it's designed to help loosen grounds that stick to the wall of the grinding chamber, the plastic ribs create additional spaces where grounds get trapped or stick to--I'd think choosing materials which avoid a static charge or have a non-stick surface inside the grinding chamber would accomplish the goal without creating more complexity and moving parts. I still use the feature to loosen grounds caught around the scraping ribs (after removing the grinding cup from the base, twisting the lid moves the ribs around the outside of the grinding chamber), but think the only reason I use it is that grounds stick to this feature--a simple tap would loosen any stuck grounds if the feature were omitted.\n\nWith this complaint aside, this grinder is: affordable, durable, creates uniform grounds, adjustable from fine to course, adjusts from grounds for 4 up to 16 cups of coffee, has a well-designed cord storage, the grinding cup is removable, cup & lid are dishwasher safe, and controls are simple to use."

I've also used it as a spice grinder and fresh dehydrated pepper grinder, which is really works extremely well for, but the VERY fine dust-like particles from spices and HOT peppers can escape the lid and get into the air easily even before you open it and it can be a real breath taker. This is NOT an issue with coffee grinding. I'm now looking into purchasing an actual spice grinder for future spice grinding. Other than that, this grinder, when used for it's intended purpose, is great.\n\n11/10/15 Update:\nWell, just as another reviewer said, after prolonged use, the little plastic arms inside start to show chipping and wear. I still can't complain about how well it stood up to everyday use for 2 years. I recently decided to retire this one to under the cabinet and bought a stainless steel grinder with removable cups."

            "reviewText": "Two years ago I bought what I think is an earlier version of this IDS77 grinder. It has the same number, but it looks a bit different - we bought it on a whim from a local discount store's \"I don't know why we have this stuff\" shelf. We bought it specifically to use for grinding whole spices. I use it for that purpose 5 or more times each week. It's a really satisfactory spice grinder: even reduces whole coriander seeds to a pretty consistent fine grind. I bought it because it has a lift-out container, so that it and the lid can be easily washed, which is necessary if you're grinding different types of spices. It works like a charm!\n\nA tip: to get whole spices ground to a fine powder, I find it works best for me to grind them with salt and/or sugar from my recipe.\n\nThe removable grinding basket is very convenient. It's great to just be able to schlep it over to the stove and empty into whatever I'm cooking. Often, if I'm adding salt or sugar at the same time, I'll grind these in with the spices: the added volume makes for a very even grind.\n\nThe cleaning arms are helpful, though not critical, I'd say.\n\nNote: I do let any whole spices I've toasted cool a bit before grinding them, as I don't know how heat resistant the basket and cleaning arms might be and don't want to find out the hard way.\n\nThough I love it, I'm not giving this particular grinder 5 stars for two reasons. The first is that we had a sort of hard start-up. It was difficult for a while (several months)to get the lids lined up into the \"start\" position correctly so that pressing the top bar would make the grinder go. This was more than a bit of a hassle. I also found myself having to press the bar in different places to make it run. I seriously thought of giving up on the machine, but liked the idea of this grinder too much to do that. Now, I'm glad I persevered. I don't have either problem any more: either the grinder has trained me, or I suspect that a little obstruction somewhere in the unit wore down. The other reason for knocking off a star that I wish the lid was easier to clean. Dust from the spices gets under the presser bar and be really hard to clean out. This is more a cosmetic issue than an operational one.\n\nBy the way, I never grind coffee and spices in the same grinder. Both items have too definite flavor and cost too much to be cross-contaminated by oils from the other.\n\nI recommend this grinder, and am buying one of them as a Christmas gift for my friend who also enjoys cooking Indian dishes."

We have the black one and it has a permanent home next to our coffee pot. It gets used at least once a day, sometimes twice. It has ground everything from Tanzanian Peaberry to Guatalaman Maragogype to Costa Rican coffees. It has performed quite well in all circumstances.\n\nUse of this item is really simple. Put the lid on securely, pick your number of cups and grind conssitency (fine, medium, or course), then push the button down until the grinding stops. There's no counting, guessing, or anything complicated about it.\n\nWhen it's done, you just dump the ground coffee into your filter and transfer it to the coffee pot. You can use the little side-arm slider things (moving them around in circles) to help get more of the coffee out, but I tend to just give it a couple of nice taps on the bottom and that does the trick.\n\nGiven how much this thing gets used, we've yet to see and major signs of wear or any signs that the blades are getting dull. Clean up is relatively easy. I usually rinse the lid and cup with water, then use a dishwand to quickly clean out the inside. It air dries in a couple hours.\n\nAll in all, I think it's a solid product. I'm sitting here on a random Sunday morning over a year after we got this and I felt compelled to jump on Amazon and do a review. It really is a simple, well-performing product."

I like fine grind because I make SUN Brewed coffee like Sun brewed tea. It keeps all the flavor but leaves behind all the bitterness and acid of hot brewed coffee.\n\nYou will have to pick the chopper/grinder up and shake it because the coffee clumps on the sides and won't fall back down into the chop blade for further chopping. Unless you shake it the entire chop time, you can get as big as half size beans when it's done. This can be a little tricky because you have to hold down the power/grind switch at the same time.\n\nI have had other chopper/grinders like this that did the same clumping so this is not something specific to this device. In a chopper/grinder design such as this, the grind cannot be consistant and uniform all the way through. But I do like the timer and the amount selectors. Although timers and selectors on this design won't give consistant grind size, it is a lot better than guessing like in similar chopper/grinders of this design without timers.\n\nThe \"chamber maid\" cleaning system is unique. It is like a built in scraper on the sides of the unit which help get out most of the coffee that has clumped to the sides.\n\nFor the price, you can't go wrong. To get consistancy requires adjustable grates and a different style of grinder, not a chopper. A really good grinder can go into the hundreds of dollars and unless you are a very picky afficianado, it isn't worth it. You can get a good grinder/roaster for about $300 and up but that's really for the amateur/pro barista. I would reccomend it to a friend with these caveates. For my purposes, I like it."

            "reviewText": "I've been grinding my own coffee for years. However, for the last several, I've been using a grind & brew coffee maker so no seperate grinder. It died so I decided to forgo the combo and just go with a seperate grinder, way cheaper thats for sure.\n\nI already had cheapy Rival that I'd bought from Walmart years ago but I was itchin' for something fancier. So I went to Target, saw the fancy Mr Coffee grinder with all the pretty lights and flip lid. It also timed the grind which the old Rival didn't and was the main thing I wanted.\n\nSo I took the fancy new grinder home, plugged 'er in (that was the first big disappointment, the cord is like 5\" long). Checked out the pretty lights on the side that let you adjust the \"timer\" for how many cups and strength of coffee. You still have to hold the grind button down but it will automatically kick off at the appropriate time. Kinda like your electric tooth brush when you've been brushing long enough. As long as you don't accidentally let your finger off the button, then you have to start all over again.\n\nThen I tried to figure out how the beans go into the bowl. I pushed and prodded, twisted and pulled and finally the flip lid opened and then the whole lid contraption came off. Seems you can do it either way but neither way is easy. You'd think the flip lid would be easy but the design simply sucks and I can't quite put my finger on why...OH I know why! Because your finger needs to flip it back and the little lever to do that is pointing to the sky making leverage to open the lid nearly impossible w/o both hands. And you've got to hold your mouth juuuust right to get that sucker to open.\n\nSo its got this clever \"basket maid\" or whatever the call it. Thought that was a cool idea to clean out the bowl but trust me, doesn't work that well. Coffee grounds now stick to it as well so you still have to bang the thing on the counter which is difficulte given the design of it. And getting the bowl back on the base can be easy or harder than heck, depens on how its feeling that day.\n\nSo. Long story short, I'm back to my cheapy Rival from Walmart and I LOVE it. Its been a few days and I had no idea how much I missed the simplicty of the Rival. You pull of the bowl lid, throw in the beans, grind til its...ground (why I thought this was hard I don't know), turn it over, tap tap on the counter and voila! Coffee's a brewin. The older I get, the more I love simplicity. So save your money and get a Rival."

Although it is noisy as most grinders seem to be, it was very well worth the money. It has setting indicator lights and different grind setting to go from coarse to fine, medium or regular. It can go in the dishwasher. It has a fully removable grinding chamber which grinds about a cup at a time. It has a polarized plug, one blade wider so it only fits into socket one way to help prevent against electric shock. The cord is long enough to reach the socket and short enough and easy to tuck in bottom of grinder when storing away. The only part out is the plug. Handy feature. After grinding its very easy to pour into storage container or directly into coffee pot filter. I use this grinder at least once a week and am very happy i bought it. I would recommend this grinder for coffee lovers who enjoy grinding different kinds of coffee beans like i do."

            "reviewDate": "October 20, 2010",
            "reviewText": "Summary: This product is fragile and less precise than less expensive models. If what you want is consistent control over the coarseness of your grind, burr grinders are the way to go. If what you want is something inexpensive that will get the job done, you can do better for cheaper. Someone wrote a glowing review of this product who disapproves of burr grinders, but I have just switched to a cheap burr grinder (Cuisinart DBM-8) from this product and my pressed coffee has never tasted better. I'll try to be a bit more specific. I would like to argue that this product is ill-suited for almost any coffee-grinding needs.\n\nThe goal of this product is to give you the control over grinding your coffee that resembles that of a burr grinder but at the price and convenience of a small blade grinder. It aims to accomplish this goal by featuring three spinning columns along the inside wall of the cup. When you grind the coffee these columns spin to keep the coffee moving onto the blade so that the beans grind consistently regardless of the speed at which the blade spins. Then, by selecting one of three settings on the device, the blade will spin more or less quickly so as to grind the beans more or less finely. (There is a second setting for how much coffee you want to grind that affects the overall duration of the grinding session.) In theory, therefore, the grinder should give you moderate control over the coarseness of your grind while all you have to do is make the appropriate selection and press the \"on\" button.\n\nHowever, these spinning columns accomplish no more than what can be accomplished by a $10 coffee grinder and a good shaking. So, the question is whether it's worth the extra money to have a grinder that changes the speed of the blade.\n\nThe main problem with this grinder in practice is that the speed-variation and stirring are utterly insufficient to grind the coffee medium-coarse (for a conic drip coffee maker) to coarse (for a press), which, incidentally, is all I ever wanted from the device. Gravity overpowers the stirring and tends to produce sedimentary layers of more to less ground coffee. This inconsistency is the worst problem you can have with a coffee grinder, in my opinion at least. For a press for example, any amount of very finely ground coffee will produce a tannin-embittered sludge at the bottom of your press/cup. This makes the final portion of your batch of coffee undrinkable, and makes the rest of it spoil more quickly. One might try to solve this problem, as my roommates have, by shaking the coffee grinder in addition to selecting its settings. But this quickly reveals two things: (1) Shaking the coffee and grinding it for a set amount of time actually can be found to exhibit more control over the grind than the settings (you can, e.g., set it to fine, shake it, and just not grind it as long and accomplish the same thing as setting it to coarse and grinding it longer); and (2) Shaking the coffee grinder appears to cause the plastic stirring columns to break. My grinder broke within a year, presumably because of shaking.\n\nIf shaking the coffee grinder gets one more consistency and control than the automatic control settings, then there is no reason to buy a grinder with such settings. Just buy a cheap one and learn the art of shaking and timing. Further, once the columns break (whether they will so easily when the product is not shaken, I cannot say), the stirring function is useless and the coffee is hopelessly inconsistent. So, if the main selling point of the product is so limited in life-span, then why not spend a little more money on a burr grinder which will last much longer.\n\nGetting down to the bottom-line, I think that what coffee grinder you purchase will depend primarily on how you intend to make your coffee. If you want medium-coarse coffee for a conic-filtered drip machine, I don't see any reason to be dissatisfied with the shake n' time method and a cheap grinder. If you happen to want medium-fine ground coffee for a cheaper machine and you're willing to resist the temptation to shake this grinder AND you want the convenience of not having to shake, then maybe this grinder will suit your needs. But if you want pressed coffee, the burr grinder is hands down the only sufficient way to go. Moreover, since the burr grinder will also give you at least equal (but I would argue better) results for the other methods of brewing just described, the only reason I see not to buy it is because you want to save $30 and get an arm workout. [Note: I've ignored the issue of espresso grinding which readers of these reviews will appreciate is a more complicated issue.]"

            "reviewText": "So I've had this grinder 3 years now, and it still works GREAT. The blades are sharp and functional, the plastic is all intact. There is some scuffing on the clear cup, but that's expected when grinding things. We use this every day, sometimes twice a day, to grind course coffee for an 8 cup french press. It gets a workout.\n\nIssues: If you washed out the residue by hand, there wouldn't be any issues. I'd call this the perfect grinder at this price point. However, since you need to clean this, and it claims the grinding cup is dishwasher safe, I must regretfully say it's not quite perfect. If you put this through the dishwasher, bits of grit and stuff, that should wash down the drain, will get trapped between the outside of the metal cup and the plastic frame. There is apparently enough room for water to get between here, but not for any sort of cleaning brush to get rid of the trapped mess. It begins to look awful and recently, I noticed that the trapped bits of food are growing mold threads. I've run this through the DW numerous times, usually every few uses. It's frankly gross that they built this in such a way to trap food, without a way to disconnect the metal cup and the plastic housing to clean between them. But like I said, if you wash the bowl out by hand, it should be just fine.\n\nAll in all, a good grinder, just not Dishwasher Safe."

Where it loses me is the fact that the coarse grind, which is preferred for using with French Presses, is so uneven that it's hard to believe anyone really uses it for a coarse grind.\n\nThe unit itself seems well built and it is easy to use and clean. For finely grinding beans I like it a lot. For coarse grinding not so much. Overall this is a decent grinder for the price, especially for those looking to use normal drip machines or the individual fillable k-cups."

I have to move the grinder up against the counter back splash in order to reach the outlet. And even at that point, it just barely reaches the bottom outlet.\nSecond, I've ground beans 3 times now and it's actually gotten progressively worse. The first time, I had a couple of whole beans left after grinding (which is somewhat acceptable). By this 3rd time, I had at least 5-7 beans that hadn't even been touched - still whole. And there were literally another 10 or so beans that were merely cut in half or thirds. The little plastic \"sweeper\" they have seems to jam from the grinds after just a few seconds of grinding. Once that happens, there is nothing moving the beans around other than the blades. I believe that it where the inconsistency is coming from. Just a guess on my part.\nOverall, I could not recommend this grinder to anyone with a straight face. Sure if you want something cheap, it \"kind of\" does the job, but not really. There are many other $20 grinders out there that would be a better choice."

Grounds still stick to the bottom, and they're harder to clear out with the plastic mechanism in the way.\nThe lid is designed to allow you to simply lift and pour grounds out, but that doesn't work well either. You have to take the top off and pour that way to get all of the grounds out. That's easy enough to do, of course, but I find it annoying that it doesn't work as intended.\nThe timer for the grind is way off - you have to keep an eye on the coffee yourself to make sure it's not too finely ground. This is another thing that is easy enough to do, but why put a timer on the thing if it's not going to do its job?\nIt sometimes took me a couple of tries to get the top locked in place so that I could start the grind. It's just a bit clumsy, which was never an issue with my previous grinder.\n\nDespite all that, the grinder still ground coffee, which was its primary job, so I kept using it daily anyway. Unfortunately, the motor stopped and it refused to grind any more after only a month of use, so now it doesn't even have that going for it. I hate to throw this hunk of plastic in the trash after such a short time, but I guess that's where it belongs."

However, the cord is less than two inches long so if you have a kitchen where your counter has a backsplash, you will need to get an extension cord to use your coffee mill.\n\nIt does come apart easy and it grinds quickly. However, the medium grind does grind beans coarsely, and I do not consider that to be a medium grind at all. Even after two cycles, some beans were still in large chunks. I did learn that when it says do not fill past this line, it means it and I got a better grind by not filling it as high as the fill line. However, on medium it still gives a course grind so I use the fine setting and it works perfectly.\n\nIf the cord length, or lack thereof, is not an issue, this is a good coffee grinder, just use the fine setting."

To turn the grinder on, you have to press really hard on one particular spot and hold for dear life. If you slightly release the pressure, the grinder stops and thus loses the selection of the amount and grind of coffee. Then the coffee grind is very uneven.

If you like a fine or medium ground though you won't have an issue.\n\nWhat's really nice about this grinder is that the lid, and the part that holds and grinds the beans comes apart from the main unit making it pretty easy to clean. The chambermaid cleaning system is ok... it does help get some of the grinds off of the sides and bottom but it makes it a bit hard to clean the chamber.\n\nOverall I like the grinder and it is the right price. If you want something more sophisticated or precise you will probably have to pay more but this thing gets the job done."

            "reviewText": "When I look for a coffee grinder, I look for 4 things:\n\n1) Noise: This grinder is fairly noisy, but then again, so are most grinders. On a scale of 1-10 as far as noisyness goes compared to other grinders, I'd give it a 7.\n\n2) Consistency: I like to grind my coffee coarse for french press; this grinder isn't very good at making a consistent coarse grind. However, if you want a regular grind for drip coffee or a fine grind for expresso, it does a really good job at that.\n\n3) Static: I hate it whenever you pull the top off of a grinder to get the coffee out and tiny grind go flying everywhere--I've never had a problem with this grinder. You can open the top and pour the grinds out (which is difficult to do if you're trying to get it into a small container because the spout itself is not much different from the lip of a cup) or you can scoop the grinds out, which I preferto do anyway to double measure stuff (old habit).\n\n4) Cleaning: This grinder has a removable top that you can take apart, which makes cleaning very easy. It also says it has a \"Chaimber Maid\" system...all that is is three thin plastic \"claws\" that hug the inside of the grinding chamber which you rotate awkwardly so that they scrape the sides of the chamber. It's neat, but unnecessary.\n\nOther features:\n\nThere is a \"cord storage\" system that is a bit of a hassle to use because it requires you to coil the cord into a groove under the grinder (when you get the grinder only a short bit of the cord is shown, and the rest is coiled. It doesn't look like you can uncoil the cord from down there, and unless you're crazy enough to pull the cord out of your brand new grinder you'll have no clue that the thing is actually 37 inches long)\n\nIt has an \"auto off\" feature...I've never used it because my grindes always reach the coarsness I like before the timer shuts off the grinder.\n\nThe measuring system that the grinder uses is marked on the sid of the grinder which is very helpful (you don't have to pull out the manual every time you want to know how many Tbsp of coffee you need to make # cups of coffee)\n\nIt's about 8 in. tall with the diameter at the top being 4 in. (it's wider at the top).\n\nOverall:\n\nI like the grinder. I'd rather have a pull-cord-storage and a quieter grinder, but for the price that I paid, I'm a happy customer."

Since our other one was several years old we just decided to buy another one. We liked it, it does a great job, so why not buy another. Now we open the box on the second one just before the Thanksgiving holidays and encountered exactly the same issue with the new one. We purchased at Walmart, but won't be buying another one based on this reason and the explanation below of our phone experience with Mr. Coffee.\n\nI literally just got off the phone with Vanessa at Mr. Coffee. She could offer no help as the date code on the prongs was out of range for ANY warranty service. Even if I provided a copy of the receipt to her...she could not help...it must go back to the retailer. EVEN WITHIN THE 1 YEAR OF WARRANTY. It took a few attempts at asking in a different way to get that answer. I asked if there is a known issue regarding the grounds 'leaking out' from just under where the \"Push On\" button is located, but I got a standard \"No we don't have that problem on our grinders\"...well obviously you do.\n\nRetailers buy these in bulk and who knows about the date code and inventory...but Mr. Coffee could offer no help what so ever...they just had a standard template of questions and no technical assistance. So because of that we will not waste our time buying another one (which could have the same issue) and run around to get a headache. We will just buy another brand with better reviews.\n\nMy attempt to upload a video hasn't been all that successful. I have however spent $5 on food grade silicone sealer to remedy the issue. Under the 'button' you press down to start the grind is a huge void that collects grounds due to a design flaw. Packing it with the food grade silicone prevents the grounds from filling the void and then falling out when you twist the cap."

You get what you pay for. UPDATE: I ended up buying a more expensive Mr. Coffee because I like the brand. I bought the Burr Mill BMH Series. #1: IT'S LOUD! But I figured I could put up with that for the small amount of time it's running (except when you have company and the bedroom is right next to the kitchen). It did a good job grinding the beans. #2: The lid on the Grinding Chamber has an inset for a small scoop/cleaning brush. When you grind the beans, the ground beans get blown onto this lid inside the chamber (understand?) and it's a real pain to clean. #3: I hadn't even had it a year yet and one morning I didn't get the amount of ground beans that I had dialed - and used every day. I figured it needed to be cleaned so I took it apart and cleaned it per the instructions. It worked - for about two weeks. It's now back to not grinding the amount of beans I dialed. I plan on calling Mr. Coffee tomorrow to see what they have to say but if it has to be sent back to be fixed, it's not worth the hassle. And then what do I use to grind my beans while it's gone? It would be easier to just go out and buy a new one but it won't be another Mr. Coffee. I'm disappointed because it did a good job for the short time it worked.

Notice past-tense, a few grinds after purchasing this device the arms broke and were ground up with the rest of the coffee grounds. And no, I of course didn't notice I was brewing a teaspoon of black plastic powder with my coffee. It's fortunate that I don't care enough about spotless appliances to be grieved by the loss of the plastic arms (which did in fact remove about half the coffee powder from the chamber walls, if I remember right.)\n\nSecond feature I don't understand, the lid. The device has a fundamentally simple function; you add coffee beans, press a button, remove coffee powder. The button is fine, but the adding and removing is greatly hampered by what appears to be a futuristic pod bay door with a window and another door inside it. The interior clear plastic door thingy flaps loosely and doesn't remove completely, which distributes coffee powder throughout your counter tops. But this is totally unnecessary because you can easily unscrew the whole lid and actually remove the majority of coffee powder. Just be careful when you put the lid down somewhere as the inner door could swing open and distribute coffee powder.\n\nAll things considered, after removing the broken body of Chamber Maid and duct-taping the \"door\" shut, it does grind coffee beans. 2 stars."

Second disappointment: as a chopper it is far worse than the Krups I already own. Third disappointment: the so-called settings are just timers that shut the thing off after a preset amount of time, and not even very consistent timers. Sometimes they chop for 9 seconds and another time, on the same setting, decide to hang on for 12 seconds. The \"coarse\" setting, which I first tried, because I use a French press coffee maker, is so crude that some of the beans don't get chopped at all. Through trial and error, I discovered that to chop beans for a 3 cup Bodum, I needed to set the grinder to medium grind, 6 cups, and even there, it sometimes requires extra time to chop the beans.\n\nThe only feature that I consider worthwhile is the \"chambermaid\", which does do a decent job of loosening the ground coffee from chamber. Otherwise, the grinder is a rip-off, even at its low price. If this is your price range, just buy a regular chopper. My Krups, which is so old it doesn't even have a polarized plug, still does a better job of chopping up beans than the Mr. Coffee."

After a disastrous experience with a burr grinder, I bought another IDS77. This one also lasted about a year--now the chamber maid gizmo, made out of plastic, that's supposed to help clean the grinds from the edges of the bowl, has broken in two places and the shafts look worn down. So I've been drinking shaved plastic along with my coffee! This is obviously a design flaw that numerous reviewers have pointed out. But the blade is riveted on top of it, so it can't be removed or replaced. And Mr. Coffee has not corrected the problem by substituting a metal chamber maid or just leaving it out of the product. I'll be buying a new grinder, and it won't be a Mr. Coffee. By the way, when it works it's fairly decent for a blade grinder. Noisy, but grinding time can be varied so you have some control over coarseness. We like a coarse french press grind."

I purchased the Mr. Coffee IDS77 from a local store. I hated it; it only had 3 grind settings, it was not easy to use, I had to stand there and hold the button till it stopped, the cord wrap was a royal pain, and worst of all some beans were ground to a fine powder but it also left big unground chunks of coffee bean at the completion of the coarse-grind cycle - - yuck! And it was difficult for me to disassemble, clean, and reassemble with arthritic hands (lots of twisting involved).\n\nAfter reading all the reviews here (thank you, fellow Amazon fans!) I ordered the Hamilton Beach 80374 Hands-Free for just a few more dollars and WHAT A DIFFERENCE! See my review at that product.\n\nNeedless to say, I am returning the Mr. Coffee grinder."

I think that it does do a great job at grinding (but it's loud--I felt like I was waking up everyone in the teacher dorm each morning I used it!!) and all the different settings seem to yield appropriate grind sizes. The problem I had with it was the cleanup. The main reason I think I had problems was that the manual said not to use any beans with flavors...the flavored coffee beans leave a residue that is a little difficult to clean out. So that is my own fault but shouldn't a grinder be compatible with flavored beans? I think so! The other negative aspect was the fact that the \"handy\" pour spout was not handy at all. I would need to use a garbage can to ensure I was not going to dump coffee grounds all over the counter or even myself! It was still difficult to get all the grounds out without opening up the grinder and then I would still end up getting a little bit of the grounds on the counter. This could be significantly improved. One last thing...the cord doesn't really stay wrapped up very well. I think a model with a retractable cord would be better. I think I got mine for $15 at Wal-Mart."

You choose how many cups and what type of grind you want and it stops when it reaches that consistency. Even that works great and is great for my husband when he makes me a pot of coffee or french press because I know he can't mess it up.\nIt certainly isn't a $300 grinder but for the average consumer like myself, it gets the job done and does it well!

Unless your beans are stale, fresh ground coffee will not just dump out it. You have to take the lid off to do that which isn't a big deal. Don't be to impressed with the words \"Chamber Maid Cleaning System. This is a plastic basket within the grinder's cup that you have to push with your finger and it scrapes the sides clean. I assume this was a feature they added just to mark the price up another $1.\n\nMy one dissapointment with this is that if you do regularly wash in the top rack of your dishwasher, over time little bits of food collect in the underside of the cup and they can not escape even if you soak it later. I just close my eyes and pretend it's not there anymore until either the motor goes or the cup brakes (this type of plastic that if washed continuously in dishwasher usually lasts 1/5 - 2 years and then breaks) and I buy another model of grinder. So if this is something you would not ejoy just hand wash it."

The chamber maid is neat, but doesn't get everything around the edges and will surely break eventually. The selection lights would continue to stay on after I was finished grinding so I had to unplug the device from the wall when not in use. The power chord is about a foot long!\n\nI got this to replace a simple grind-in-the-cap style grinder that would make a mess putting the cap back on. The Mr. Coffee is neat because the grind device comes off so you have less potential for a mess. I use it to grind espresso and it's pretty hard to scoop coffee out of the deep container and worthless with the flip up cap on. The Chamber maid gets all in the way when trying to scoop as well. Taking the cap off can potentially create the same mess that my other grinder made.\n\nI could hold my old grinder in my hand and shake it up and down during grinding to attempt to grind beans more evenly. This one is too big and doesn't fit good in your hand so you can't do that easily and it tends to grind the beans at the bottom more finely than those at the top. Then it turns off automatically because of the silly timer, when you don't want it do.\n\nNeat idea, bad execution. I went back to my simple grinder."

I'm not a coffee drinker so I can't base my review on its efficiency on coffee beans but to anyone out there looking for a really good flaxseed grinder then you've found it in this machine. I'm seriously amazed at how well it works. Flaxseeds are super tiny and I thought I would've needed a burr grinder but wanted to avoid the expense (cheapy I know). I took a chance, held my breath, crossed my fingers and made the purchase praying it would do the job...and it did. I'll post pics some time later but the grinder literally transformed the flaxseeds into the consistency of powder. In fact it looks like fine brown sugar. I used the grind setting 8 and the cup setting 6. Every single seed was ground. Now I was especially careful not to fill the plastic cup past the max fill limit. In fact I advise only filling it halfway below the max fill line. It places less stress on the machine and allows for optimum grinding. Disclaimer: the machine is obviously not designed as a flaxseed grinder. Use at your own discretion. I'm not encouraging its use outside of what it's manufactured for. If you purchase it to use as a flaxseed grinder you are fully responsible for it thereafter. Now that that's out of the way on to the cons. Cleaning the cup is a bit disturbing only because the blade part is not removable. You have to wash around it. Also there's a plastic frame thing inside of the cup that is also fixed in place and can't be taken out so god forbid any particles get trapped beneath it. Other than that, so far so good."

Short cord. Yes, you can pull it out. Mine only comes out so far. I have tried everything short of breaking the plastic cover. Consequently can only stand by a wall socket. Biggest complaint: it makes a mess. The top flips open. When removed, the top tends to dangle in course of removal, spreading grounds everywhere. The motor is weak, or maybe the combination of cheap cutting edge and weak motor causes uneven grinds. Cannot fill very much in cup to grind, otherwise VERY uneven grind. Was an impulse buy. Too many pieces should make buyers wary. Go for simplicity in design and efficient cutting edges. Make it all happen in one move. Recommend paying more for satisfaction and longevity."

            "reviewText": "I hate this coffee grinder more than any other cheap piece of plastic I've ever owned. There is a special place in hell for gadgets like this that are over-designed and still cannot even do the one thing they were made to do. Take my review with a grain of salt I guess because there are plenty of good reviews. But my experience with this was awful. First of all, this thing is LOUD. Not just LOUD but one of those aggravatingly loud sounds. The cord is ABSURDLY short. You basically have to hug the wall to use it. The only good thing is it was a conversation start - everyone got a kick out of the short cord - \"Gotta cut costs somewhere\" they'd almost always laugh. There are TOO MANY PARTS. I don't know how there are so many parts to this. It's a coffee grinder. There should be a LID. That's it. One part. But inevitably when a guest would try to use this thing and empty out the grounds, plastic parts would fall apart and bounce across the floor. And FINALLY - I don't think I ever got a single grind that actually FULLY GROUND. It would appear ground, I'd put it in the filter, start the coffee, and inevitably there would be quartered, halved, and sometimes FULL BEANS that would rise to the top of the filter after the coffee maker finished. I never understood how a coffee grinder could not grind coffee.\n\nLook...coffee grinding for the common man should be simple. The unit is not simple, nor does it grind coffee well. Do yourself a favor and buy something like http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004SPEU/ I did. And a group of us went out back to collectively feel good about throwing this Mr. Coffee grinder in the dumpster. Sometimes we still talk about it and smile."

On the fine grind I found that I got buildup of grounds at the bottom (tight corners) so as I said before I got a cleaning brush and no more problems."

The inner plastic chunk of the grinding chamber broke off, and now it's useless. The motor assembly works fine, and it feels like such a waste to throw away something that is 90% functional. But seeing as that extra 10% of functionality is the entire purpose of this product, it's time to find a new grinder.\n\nI would only recommend this if you're strapped for cash and need a grinder quick, or if you don't grind coffee with any regularity."

I am now worried that I am actually ingesting little bits of plastic every time I drink my coffee. There are simple grinders out there without these fancy accessories that last much longer.

Researched burr grinders then this, but after reading that the plastic wears off, I decided not to get this model.\n\nI then thought about the krups 203. However, before I decided to buy it, I remember I have a mini chopper. I tried it, and I'm able to quickly grind my coffee beans as fine as powder if I wanted to. I bought my mini chopper at good-will for five bucks. The model is similar to Cuisinart MM-2M Mini Mate Chopper (it looks exactly like it in fact). It has 240 watts max. I'm happy about it, so I won't be buying a coffee grinder. However, if you guys are thinking about grinder your coffee, consider the EHC650 as it's only about twenty bucks, and I think i thas a better blade design than the MM-2M. I rather buy a device that can grind nuts and all other useful stuff such as flax seed than to be stuck with a coffee grinder. Hope this helps. I don't understand why anyone would want to buy a hundred dollar plus grinder these days. My mini chopper can literally turn the coffee bean into dust so there's no need for a burr grinder, though I've never used one.\n\nBut this? No way when I've read that the plastic eventually wears out. Why can't these company simply make the container out of glass? I'll be willing to pay an extra five bucks. Let people have the choice and you'll be respected."

A friend brewed me a cup from fesh ground beans and I was hooked but had no idea of how to grind the beans. This grinder was so easy to use, explained all I needed to know and now I am buying gourmet coffee on Amozon. Great value for the cost."

Buy it to aggravate someone.\n_____________________________________________\n\n10 reasons to NOT buy this, Piece-of-C! (there's more reasons, here's just 10)\n\n1.) Cord is too short. (Add 4 inches more and it be useful. (All about GREED)\n2.) VERY NOISY (Thin cheap plastic only amplifies the noise. (MORE GREED)\n3.) Convenient flip top spout. (UNLESS you like making a mess! Convenient? NOT!)\n4.) Grind choice buttons. (Total waste of beans! *)\n(* By not grinding beans to a fine powder, you're just wasting beans. You're NOT using the whole bean and you're not getting the whole flavor out of the bean)\n5.) IF your one who wants to cut back on caffeine, buy this piece of `Bull Scat'.\n6.) IF you're the many who wants to keep their sanity, look at the lesser expensive grinders.\n7.) This unit is a perfect example to look elsewhere to find that, LESS is MORE.\n8.) Bean wipers. (IF they touched the bowl, it might work)\n9.) Cleanliness? (NOT A CHANCE! Cannot clean under the wipers. EXPECT mold to grow there! E-YUK)\n10.) Twist off lid. (OH MY GOD! *)\n(* OMG)\nYou're going to make coffee in the morning and your eyes are dreary and squinty, the VERY LAST thing you need is aggravation. This grinders flip top is hard to find its tabs to twist into the bowl. Once you manage to get THAT together, your second (aggravating) task is to insert the bowl onto the base. IF you don't get it in the right direction it WILL NOT twist to its correct position so the hidden push-tab can start the motor. By now you don't need coffee, you're WIDE AWAKE from this aggravation.\n\nMr. Coffee, go BACK to the drawing board, get RID of those who designed this garbage and KISS it. KEEP IT SIMPLE, SAM!"
