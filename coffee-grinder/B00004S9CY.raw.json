NY Times goes on and on about the need for a burr grinder to get a consistent grind to avoid bitter coffee, but I think that's getting way too laboratory soecific. 99 percent of people won't know the difference. You'll get a consistent (enough) grind out of this if you know what you're doing and give it a little time for trial and error to get a specific grind dialed in. I use a Bialetti Italian press and this grinder helps me make fantastic and consistent coffee all day, every day."

Also, you can't overfill it with beans--if you do, it doesn't grind at all. AND, the little engine gets pretty hot, which only adds to my frustration at having not just purchased a burr.\n\nMy Cuisinart coffee maker? Now, that's five-star awesome; this little grinder, not so much. BUT, had I read the descriptor more closely, it does give little clues that it might be a little grinder..."

The first one os still going strong. The only way this could be better is if it had a slightly larger, removable cup, so that you could use it for wet and dry grinding. There are some like that on the market, but they have very mixed reviews."

Finally got a burr grinder and will NEVER go back. However, this grinder can be made to grind spices if you are mechanically inclined. The blade on this and Cuisinart's hand held mixer is blunt and just about worthless.\n\nHowever, unlike their hand held mixer, this blade can be easily removed. Just take a roughly 3/8\" dowel (a stick or handle of a wooden spoon) and place it on the right side of either blade pointed away from you. Now, whack the dowel with a wooden spoon or something. The blade will unscrew counter clockwise. Use a file or a Dremel with a stone and sharpen the blade. Now you have a fair to good grinder for spices.\n\nOne note of caution. DO NOT EVER GET ANY WATER IN THE GRINDING BOWL. The only thing separating the motor shaft from the bearing (actually a bushing) is a felt washer. Get it wet and it stays wet, corroding the shaft and speeding its demise. Also, DO NOT FILL THE GRINDING BOWL MORE THAT 3/4 OF THE WAY FULL (less for hard to grind substances). The full line is where the metal bowl ends and the plastic starts. OVERLOAD THIS CHEAP MOTOR AND IT WILL DIE."

With a few quick presses of the triangular button it grinds the coffee beans into coarse pieces perfect for a French press, plus the amount of coffee it grinds is perfect AND no clean up!

I also don't like the lid which has a plastic inner ring that the coffee beans like to get stuck in. These beans make it tough to close the top so you can engage the start switch and won't get ground up if you do manage to start it. It is also difficult to dump the ground product into the coffee maker as the lid won't hold all the coffee so you have to unplug the unit and tip the whole machine over to empty it. On the plus side unit has plenty of power and has a reasonable quality feel to it."

The only real complain I have about this unit is the fact that the lid is very dark and you can't see well inside to evaluate the grinding process.\n\nI liked the Braun better as the lid is clear and you can see what's happening inside; this way you can achieve the proper grind without opening the lid to check.\n\nThe Braun has 150 Watt motor while the Cuisinart has 130 W. The Cuisinart looks more modern and sharper. With either you can get a good grind, but I would go with the Braun.....I'm currently considering a Burr grinder, but I can't sell my self that it'll be worth all that counter realstate....I keep my coffee in the fridge, and after grinding it to fine it does not feel hot, maybe warm if I grind to a super fine. From the reviews I read on the Burr Grinders, it looks like a lot more hassle, but what the heck, we love to complicate our lives...."

But she used her first one so much that 2 years later the blades wore off. I bought her another one of the same thing. She also bought one for use at work. I have had mine for at least 3 years and if it ever wears out I will buy another of the same. It is affordable and dependable."

It's a toss up if I've actually put enough coffee beans in the grinder. There are measuring \"dots\" on the side of the lid that can be used to measure the amount of beans you're adding to the grinder, but with irregular shaped beans, you never know if the measure is to the top or middle of the bean level. Cord storage is an issue, especially before you've had your first cup of coffee in the morning..."

I bought it because my Cuisinart Grind and Brew coffee maker did not grind the coffee fine enough for my taste and there is no way to adjust it.\n\nThe DCG-20N coffee grinder is probably the poorest designed coffee grinder I have ever seen. The lid for the grinder fits INSIDE the bowl of the grinder. It is almost impossible to get the lid on once the bowl is filled with coffee beans. You can force the lid on, but then there are coffee beans that are trapped outside the lid between the lid and the casing. Then when you go to pour the ground coffee out, you get some beans that did not get ground at all. Why in the name of all that is sane did you have the lid go INSIDE the casing???\n\nIf I had not already thrown away the box it came in, I would CERTAINLY have returned it!\n\nI bought a Cuisinart grinder expecting a quality product. I certainly did NOT get one with this coffee grinder!"

After buying their combo grinder/maker for our new second home, I gave up cleaning that joke every day and got the seperate maker and grinder of the same brand.\n\nI'm a fool, don't be like me.

I've owned coffee grinders for decades - mine is a German brand (update: just checked, mine is a Siemens, and I don't find them anymore on Amazon, which is too bad) - and we just got this model at my mom's house. It simply doesn't work. Isn't strong enough. Doesn't hold enough coffee. The blade isn't sharp enough. And then it started smoking from the \"overwork.\"\n\n1. This holds far fewer coffee beans than my German model. Which is a problem when you're using a cafetiere that requires a decent amount of ground coffee. Again, compared to my other model, this holds far less coffee.\n\n2. Either the blade isn't sharp enough, or fast enough, or the motor isn't strong enoug, but it simply wouldn't chop up the beans fully. I was going to attach a photo of what it did to my Jamaica Blue Mountain beans after about a minute of grinding (which entailed the machine constantly stopping and me constantly sticking my finger in there to unjam the blade), but I seem to have lost that option in these reviews. Suffice it to say I had chunks of coffee grounds throughout - this stuff didn't even look like Folgers, let alone halfway to espresso, which is how I like my coffee. There were huge chunks of beans in there, a lot of them. It's not that the device doesn't work well, it doesn't work - period.\n\n3. It start smoking after a few minutes of unjamming the thing and trying to continue grinding the beans.\n\nI have owned similar devices for decades. This thing is a piece of junk. It even feels like a piece of junk - very lightweight, in a bad way. At it most basic level, grinding coffee, this thing failed. It simply didn't grind the coffee at all. I'm really disappointed that Cuisinart would put its name on something like this. (I tried to find out where it's made, but it wasn't entirely clear from the box.)\n\nYou can check my other reviews, I don't pan everything. This, however, is a piece of garbage. Run, don't walk, to another brand as fast as you can. It's not worth twenty bucks. It's not worth two bucks. It simply doesn't work.\n\nUPDATE: It's dead. Mom just tried using it, and the thing is dead. Mind you, we used this thing once, followed the instructions about not putting in too much coffee (mind you, my german brand has no such rules), and it smoked and went to coffee grinder heaven."

I bought the Cuisinart because the Krupps is black, and I wanted a white grinder to match my kitchen. I do like the design of this product for some odd reason, it's a shape that it's a little more appealing to the eye than the Krupps. Yet I would soon discover how little that matters, and more to the point, how utterly inferior this product is. When I tried filling the already small cabin with beans, it wouldn't properly grind. I was forced to do it one half at a time. Then, this morning, only a week after arrival, it stopped working entirely. An odd smell emanated from it. I concluded that it was the motor slightly burning. I took out the beans, and lodged on each side of the inner cabin, between the blade and sides, was a half ground bean, preventing the blade from propelling. Not once in fifteen years did this happen with my Krupps. The motor is weak, or the blades are not sharp, or some combination thereof, and I have neither the time nor the caffeine-less inclination to investigate further. I am returning it, and getting a brand new Black Krupps that doesn't go in my kitchen. It's color to perfectly match my heart's sentiments about this deeply disappointing product."

I had been borrowing a friends ProtorSilex and for a blade grinder it let me make a decent cup of coffee. (It's hard not to get a good cup here in the western highlands of Guatemala .. eat your hearts out :-) Any way this things lid just sucks. I'm only grinding about 3/8 of a cup of beans at a time (for a 16oz cup.. if anyone has a recommendation for the amounts of beans to use per 8oz of water I'd appreciate it) The advert says grinds enough for 12 cups.. No freaking way unless you're serving in Demitasse cups.\nAs far as the lid, I have yet been able to pour my grounds into a 600ml french press without getting grounds on the counter. The ProcterSilex was no problem. The Cuisenart has some kind of chamber around the main chamber for the grounds and grinds get in there and then spill out. The PS I borrowed poured clean.\nAlso this thing has about 3 times the residue on it compared to the PS machine. That may be because it is grinding finer than the PS. I'm going to work on pulsing the machine to make a courser grind and this observation may change. The Cuisenart also advertised that it had storage for the cord. There some hollow space in the body of the machine which I can carefully slip about half the chord into but if this is what they meant, dream on. The PS you just twisted the base and the chord retracted into .. nice."

This machine on the other hand is quite a bit larger and when I attempted to grind enough beans for a strong 10 cup pot, the blade quit spinning several times and after enough fooling around it chopped them up, but one could hardly call it a ground bean, it looked more like grass clippings.\n\nI doubt this thing will last very long after watching it literally stop working with a full load of beans to grind. I now use it for a small afternoon pot of coffee, half full of beans it will eventually produce a \"ground\" bean product. Another annoyance is its shape, difficult to hold on to especially early in the morning if you happen to have a touch of arthritis.\n\nNOT worth even the $13 it is advertised for on here.\n\nUPDATE: If I could give it less than one star, I would. After putting up with this grinder for a brief period, I moved it to my RV to take on trips a couple of times a year, and moved my now 24 year old Krups grinder back to first string. This terrible product worked on the first trip, in its own feeble way, chopping up, shredding beans enough to make a couple of cups of strong coffee. Now, six months later, the beans jam the blades each time you attempt to fill it beyond the height of the shallow metal cup. I'm ordering another Krups this week before they change the style of that machine. Don't waste your cash on the Cuisinart."

Because I don't eat refined sugar and, as far as I know, you can't buy raw/unrefined confectioner's sugar - but if anyone knows where you can, please tell me!). You can only grind about 1/2 a cup at a time, but that hasn't really been a big issue to me, although I can see where it would be if you're trying to grind coffee for several people in a timely manner. I've even found that although the bowl of the grinder isn't removable, I can rinse it off at my sink without adverse consequences. Now, I wouldn't try fully immersing the unit in water or anything like that, but rinsing the inside out isn't going to short the motor. It isn't terribly noisy, but it's not whisper quiet either...I mean, you're grinding solid objects into powder, some noise is to be expected. I've had this particular grinder for six years, and the motor is still in great working order, and the blades are still pretty sharp.

I looked around on amazon and ended up buying a Krups coffee grinder to replace it. After using the Krups for about 2 weeks, I miss my Cuisinart! A true (if somewhat trivial) case of not knowing what I had until it was gone. I may try to superglue my old one back together, or I may just break down and buy a new one of these, because I think it's clearly superior to the Krups.\n\nThis grinder doesn't grind as fast as the Krups, and it's probably a little bit louder, but the consistency of the grind is FAR superior to the Krups grinder, and that's really all that matters to me! I could grind for a short period of time to get perfect percolator coffee grounds for camping coffee, a little longer to get a good consistent grind for drip coffee, or a little longer yet to get a pretty good grind for espresso. The Krups I got to replace it will leave some beans in large chunks and some espresso-powder fine. The only time I can get grounds with even consistency is if I go for a long enough time to get them all at espresso level.\n\nIt's fairly small, and I would fill it a little more than what the directions said to do, but I could get grounds enough for a strong 12 cup pot of coffee, and there would be no large chunks that came to the surface of the grounds when I went to remove the filter. And like I said earlier - it lasted me 5 years and would have gone longer had I not been clumsy. Solid coffee grinder for the price - I highly recommend it."

You end up with some fine ground and some course ground in the same batch. One cause for this is that the grinding cup is proportionally too deep as compared to the blade. So the beans don't circulate adequately to even-out the grind.\n\nSecondly, the claim of being large enough for 12 cups is simply false. I can only grind enough beans for 2 cups. Of course I use a French press, so I use more beans. But seriously, this only holds 5 scoops of beans. If you're making 12 cups of coffee with 5 scoops, that's some mighty watery coffee. Or maybe you're making demitasse cups. But even with 2-3 oz. cups, I don't think this has the capacity for 12. And let's face it, if we're buying a coffee grinder we probably like coffee and drink the standard size cup.\n\nRegarding the design, it's not round, but rather has a bulge on the right side which makes it awkward to hold. It's almost like it was designed for left handed people.\n\nI'm not a hater. It's functional, and I use it. But it has drawbacks that will make me look for a higher quality grinder next time through."

It grinds fairly evenly, but not as well as a good burr mill. It cleans out easily and also works great for grinding other herbs and spices, and making for making meat rubs. It's fairly loud, so use it after everybody is awake (or as a morning wake up call). It is probably the best buy for under $20. If you have never ground your own coffee, this is a great way to get a good cup of coffee for little cost. It also takes up very little counter space and it's available in colors to match just about any kitchen."

One star is too kind.\n\nEDIT:\nTried another of this same one, thinking the last one was defective. IT WAS NOT. The same thing happened, but spanned over only a couple of uses. There is a MAJOR DESIGN FLAW which causes coffee beans to become lodged between the blade and the body of the grinder and it just catches itself on fire. Really, Cuisinart? Biggest waste of time and money."

The coffeemaker was mediocre and I actually purchased an Aerobie aeropress in the end. But going back to the grinder, I'm glad that I spent zero dollars on the product and it worked okay during the first 10 grinds. The cup is very small and I had a large can of beans to grind.\n\nAfterwards, it was dead. Didn't even sputter and die, just went dead after using the grinder as directed. I suggest you spend the money on something else rather than this product. I've never had any bad experiences with Cuisinart before and is disappointed that this grinder would go so quickly. I'll just stick to grinding my beans at the local supermarket before bringing it home."

And of course, like an idiot, I tossed the \"instructions\" and \"warranty papers\". C'mon you really need instructions to use this? The claim of 12 cup capacity is bogus. The Keurig people \"could\" say it has a 1/2 gallon capacity and that is true..but one cup at a time. This thing makes an inconsistent grind, and produces weak coffee. It should be an embarrassment to the company..and our country for not being able to manufacture a stupidly simple product as this. Buh bye Cuisinart!"

There are much better products available. Even though it's not broken I am going to return it immediatley."

If you are going to make a full pot of coffee you will have to grind 2 or 3 loads. For the 6 cups of coffee I brew in the morning I only need to grind two full loads of coffee beans. If you don't overload the coffee beans it works fine. I recommend finding measuring cup. Once you grind the beans it is good to shake the grinder to get all of the beans ground. If you do this you get perfectly ground coffee.\n\nThe cord of the grinder is about 18\". It's a little shorter than their previous model but manageable. Compared to a Mr. Coffee grinders whose motors kept burning out I would definitely recommend this model."

Because it's so compact it doesn't grind very much at one time, but it's nice to have a compact and efficient way to make fresh coffee in the morning.\n\nUpdate: Motor died yesterday mid-grind. So, lasted less than two years."

Since I'm used to turning a wheel on the burr grinder to get the level of grind I need, I had to experiment a couple of times to get it right with this grinder but the result was consistent and evenly ground coffee beans. I used them in my french press and it was perfect.\n\nI'll probably keep this exclusively for spices since I already have a burr grinder but it is a well made, attractive addition to my countertop and I found nothing awkward about using it. The top fits well and the pulsing was far more quiet than I'd expected. A good product in all I'd say."

I bought this mostly because of the name thinking I would get a quality product. The grind is great but it doesn't hold very much coffee and it is difficult to empty. When emptied into the lid by turning it upside down according to the instructions, the ground coffee overflows the lid and spills. When I try to empty from the grinding container, it flows quickly and spills. I wind up emptying it with a spoon to avoid spills. It takes two grinds to make 12 cups of coffee. I have replaced mine and sent it to Goodwill. I replaced it with the larger Quisinart which I found on sale locally and love it. It has a removable grinding basket and holds enough coffee for 12 cups. I recommend that one."

The way the lid fits on the top means you can't load that many beans, and have to move the beans out of the way for it to fully close. It's such a small amount I have to do it twice to make a small batch of French press coffee. I've used other grinders that work perfectly so I never even imagined that a design could be so flawed, especially for Cuisinart. Disappointing. Cheaper ones I've bought by \"no name\" brands are far better."

I grind dried beans, lentils, dehy carrots, oats, basmati rice, bee pollen, chia seeds, flax seeds, etc. in this grinder for shakes. If you need quality carbs, grind them and put them in your protein shakes!! Right? Talk to me! Works like a dream!! You can grind fresh quinoa, spelt, oat or any kind of flour on the spot too. Toss the booklet that comes with it that says you can't/shouldn't grind all of this stuff.The grinder holds about a 1/4 - 1/3 of a cup and it takes just a minute or two for each batch. I couldn't live as healthily as I do without this little miracle, at least not without chewing my stinking jaw off!"

            "reviewText": "I bought this grinder at a local department store to replace a mr. Coffee blade grinder that was wearing out (had it for years). I normally use a manual burr grinder for a single cup but use the whirly birds to grind beans for large batches of cold-brew. I am very disappointed With this grinder. Here is why.\n1. Lid design: it is designed to fit inside the device, effectively cutting down on capacity and making it hard to accurately gauge the correct amount. Also makes it hard to dump coffee out. Did I mention it is a flat top which makes scooping coffee out far more awkward that a rounded lid? No? Well there you go...\n2. Mess: this thing makes a mess every time. I have tried different capacities of coffee and always lose some of my grind to the countertop, despite being careful.\n3. Power: if you do manage to get coffee beans for the 12 cups advertised be ready to wait as this grinder is way underpowered. It really struggles to get a decent grind, and I'm not talking ultra-fine espresso stuff, just regular medium grind.\n4. Cord: it's advertised to be able to store the cord but go ahead and give it a try. It isn't worth the effort. I have no clue why they just didn't use a wrap-around-the-base design like most other grinders. I store my coffee gear on top of the fridge as decorations when not in use and my wife doesn't like a jumbled mess of wires up there so this sucker gets stuffed in a pantry. Well, it did for the few weeks I used it.....now it is stuffed In a landfill somewhere.\nPlease, avoid this grinder, don't be duped by the name brand and attractive design. You'll be better off with something else."

            "reviewDate": "October 23, 2013",
            "reviewText": "I was going to get the Krups, based on reviews, but came across this in my favorite hardware store, the price was right and I figured let's keep brick and mortar stores in business, too. This is functionally the same as the two ancient Waring coffee mills I've used for years -- one for coffee, one for spices (BTW, don't use it for nuts; the oily paste is hard to clean out). Why did I need a replacement? The plastic hub that holds the blade has chipped half-away in one of them, and I don't relish the thought of ingesting more plastic someday. (Have stopped using it.) Cuisinart's blade and hub look identical to the Waring, but considering my Waring's age, and not knowing what I may have ground to cause that, I wouldn't hold the Waring's broken plastic against the Cuisinart.)\n\nThis mill looks larger than the Waring, but it turns out it holds the same amount. In fact, the metal cup is actually shorter in the Cuisinart, holding just under a coffee measure less of the rice I used to gauge volume. But the sides above the cup rise higher in the Cuisinart, so it can process the same amount, maybe a bit more. An advantage to the Cuisinart (it seems) is that the lid is sort of double-walled. The inside wall serves as a container, kind of like a modern laundry detergent cap. To empty, hold the top, turn the mill upside down and the contents drop into the inner lid space. (Give the grinder a quick zap to blow all the coffee out.) The lid then makes it easy to pour it all into your filter or a jar. No mess, whereas the old Waring design always has a few grounds stuck to the lid's edge and falling onto the counter.\n\nSo it's not the capacity that accounts for the larger size of the mill, but rather the larger cap, and a hollow compartment for storing excess cord. (Seems senseless, the cord is only 2 ft long!) On the other hand, it's so easy to grind and transfer the results, that running two batches takes just a few seconds more.\n\nNow if only the darn thing were easier to clean, so I could use it for everything."

Essentially, she bought herself a grinder to attempt to use at my house. Good luck with that.\n\nThings I dislike about it:\n1) no measurement guides that are worth anything... The one it has is supposedly for 2 cups. What about the other intervals when I have guests?\n2) When I tried to make 8 cups, the lid would not shut and the grinder would not start. I poured the beans into my other grinder and finished the job. How will it make 12 cups if I can't close the lid without beans spilling all over if I can't make 8 cups using the thing?\n3) Cord does not coil easily.\n4) You have to press the button down the whole time it's grinding, there is not selector based on # of cups or desired fineness.\n\nI am not a coffee snob. I am not a grinder snob. Krups burr grinder was equally useless.\n\nI suppose this might work for me if I took a permanent marker and marked the level at which I should pour the beans for my daily preference, and then held the button down the whole time.\n\nGive me my Hamilton Beach custom grind over this any day, even if the lid is a little ornery and the switch cover pops off. At least it gets the job done.\n\nI suppose this sounds unappreciative to the giver... I do appreciate the effort. I just wish it worked at least as well as my other grinder."

Does not hold very many beans either - definitely not a 12-cup capacity. The one time I tried to fit a few more beans in (not over the capacity, but definitely full) the thing made horrible noises and started smoking. Even after I removed half the beans, it took another minute or so until it started grinding properly again. Unfortunately this was a gift and I don't have the ability to return it, otherwise it would have gone back to the store months ago."

Also, this unit is not immersible, and you must clean it with a wet cloth rather than being able to dunk the unit in warm, soapy water. For this reason, I do not recommend using this for coffee and for spices, unless you are intentionally blending for flavor.\nThis grinds quite well, however the bowl isn't large and for large pots of coffee, I've found that I must grind the coffee in two loads.\nYou cannot see the consistency of your grind accurately, so you must open the unit and peek. It grinds so well and so quickly that it is easy to over-grind your beans.\nAll in all, it's a handy little gadget that grinds well and quickly. Its blades and motor have withstood regular usage. With little practice, you're able to grind uniformly.

Having ground the first batch, I lifted the grinder and started to move it towards the filter... and it was YANKED out of my hands by the combination of the amazingly short cord and the awful exterior design. I'm sure there is a reason for the comma-shaped cross section - but my hands just do NOT fit nicely around it. I'm a big guy, but my hands just do NOT fit around this thing. Maybe it's designed for blacksmiths or Victorian Age pickpockets... but it doesn't fit in MY hands.\n\nSo, after I flung coffee grounds all over the coffee room I got to spend the next 5 minutes playing with Mr Broom and Miss Dust Buster. The next 10 minutes were spent carrying the thing to the electronics engineering department and getting the guy to extend the power cord by 2 feet.\n\nSo, what have we got ?
