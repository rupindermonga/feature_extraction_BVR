            "reviewText": "Update - June 21, 2019:\n----------------------------------------------\nKrups Warranty process is unnecessarily slow. Here's the process:\n- Email Customer Support - 3 business days until they responded.\n- Response states that a shipping label will be sent in two business days - Never received the email with the label.\n- Once the item is shipped back and received - TWO to THREE weeks for them to determine whether to repair or replace.\n\nTotal time to receive a fixed grinder, assuming the rest of their timeline pans out and Krups doesn't ship via PONY EXPRESS: 5 weeks.\n\nThe more cynical side of me would think this is a corporate delay strategy to get the customer to just give up on the claim.\n\nOriginal Review - June 16, 2019:\n----------------------------------------------\nPros:\n- Set it and forget it - the 12 cups setting with the proper grind turned out flavorful coffee. No more guessing on the amount. Smaller amounts also were perfect for us.\n- Quiet - this unit was quite a bit quieter than our KitchenAid.\n\nCons:\n- The GRIND switch stopped working after ONLY three months of near daily use. VERY DISAPPOINTED. Now I have to weave my way through Krups' warranty process (supposedly two years if I read it right) to hopefully get this unit replaced quickly.\n- Coffee beans don't always feed and the unit periodically grinds air. This could be our particular brand of bean (Peets whole beans, which tend to be oilier than local roasters), but we find ourselves having to shove the handle of a plastic spoon into the hopper to restart the feed process at least one every seven days.\n\nNote, should I receive a positive, quick reply from Krups I will update this review to reflect that."

            "reviewText": "Bought the coffee grinder with scale after the Cuisinart I had for about 8 years finally gave up the ghost. I have to say, this grinder is fantastic and the flavor it brings out of the beans is so much better than my old grinder. There is one design flaw, IMO, that keeps it from being perfect. The grounds fall into the container from the top, which end up making a mess when you remove the container and grounds fall from the mouth onto the scale. I'll try tapping each time before pulling the container and hopefully that will prevent loose grounds from falling on the scale and counter every day. My old grinder tossed them in from the side, so this was not an issue."

            "reviewText": "I had a different brand burr grinder, it was a pain to clean, left coffee dust everywhere and could only handle a small amount of coffee at a time. Then it jammed up underneath the plastic plates and never worked good after clearing the jam. This grinder will handle almost a pound of beans at a time and grinds much quieter than the other model I owned as well as about half the noise level. The grind and drop down into the ground container is a great design and simple to clean with very little coffee dust left around the counter. While it seemed large, it actually takes up just a little more overall space than many \"compact\" burr grinders. All metal burr's, great choice and recommended for all."

It weighs in cups, oz, and grams and you can even select servings. I use 46-60g for my French press and it's pretty much automatic and on point every time. You want this grinder!"

            "reviewText": "Compared to the highly rated disk burr grinder I replaced, this one gives a consistent grind (not a lot of dust), is quieter, doesn\u2019t try to spit out the grounds fast enough to almost etch the container and does not give enough static electricity to hold the coffee dust to the sides of the container. You MUST read the directions. My one minor complaint is that the size of the cups does not agree with the size on my Cuisinart carafe. My 4 mugs of coffee uses 8 cups on the carafe but now needs 6 cups indicated on this grinder for a \u201cgood\u201d cup of joe."

Let\u2019s see how long it lasts."

Honestly, we were way happier with our $35 Cuisinart grinder that this grinder was bought to replace after years of use! The grinds go everywhere during the grinding process and when you open the reservoir to dump them out, making an absolute mess. But, worse than that, the machine jams constantly. It's currently taking us about 1-2 minutes to get enough coffee ground for a pot of coffee (there's lots of plugging, unplugging, banging, and doing whatever else we can to get the thing to grind!). We've only owned the machine 7 months. We'll be replacing this ASAP, which is so frustrating after spending so much on the grinder."

I am tired of standing next to the grinder and having to reset it no less than four times to finish a grind.

            "reviewText": "The size is good, the noise level is acceptable, the grind size seems consistent enough. I use it for french press so mostly on the course grind setting. Has plenty of settings. The issue is that the feature that weighs the coffee as its dispensed to you setting only works right about 60% of the time. The scale is very touchy and I have to re-tare it often with the empty canister. Even when I do it sometime only dispenses half or less what it is set to dispense. Usually if I unplug/replug the machine and let it reset that way it will work ok for a few days then I have to do it again. The control panel method of setting the tare indicates it works but it doesnt always stay, Meaning I usually set for 45g of coffee to be dispensed. A little over half the time it does that plus/minus a little. However other times even when the tare is set to the empty canister it only dispenses half (20g) or less coffee I set the controls to. Therefore I have to futz with my separate scale and keep grind coffee in batches to get what I need. I think the overall concept of this coffee grinder with a built in scale is great but it still needs some fine tuning. Been using it for over a month and I kept it as I know how to work around the issue but shouldnt have to."

            "reviewText": "Kept it too long deciding whether to keep or not so cannot return it. But we would not recommend it for a couple of key reasons. One, it is very difficult to clean (have to unclamp the bean container from within the grinder using a lot of hand strength and twisting to unsnap it to get it out. They you have to use brushes to clean out the interior and usually awkwardly have to hold it upside down and bang on it to get all the grinds out. Then a thorough wipe down. Too much work - and because it doesn't do a really fine grind for espresso, the taste isn't to our liking."
