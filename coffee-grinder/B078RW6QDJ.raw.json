            "reviewText": "Does what it says - grinds coffee. Burr grinder is supposed to be better than other designs. The ceramic grinding elements not only wear slower than steel but produce a more consistent grind and are easily replaceable. Stainless steel body and handle seem like pretty good quality and the parts fit together nicely. The bean reservoir holds enough for ~5 cups and it takes 40-70 cranks to produce enough ground coffee for a decent cup (depending on your preference.) Long handle gives a lot of leverage but means you have to grip the smooth steel body pretty tight. Best thing for me is, it fits perfectly inside my Aeropress plunger without the ground container on the bottom (not needed.)"

            "reviewDate": "October 14, 2019",
            "reviewText": "This is a great little grinder, I highly recommend it. This is my 2nd purchase of these grinders, but that doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s anything wrong with it. I used my first grinder for hundreds of grinds and almost four years before an internal plastic part broke. This grinder is robust, compact and extremely effective. You can adjust the size of your grind easily and reliably, and it will grind for every type of coffee maker (from ultra fine for espresso to extremely coarse for French-pressed coffee). The ceramic burr is extremely durable and does its job perfectly. In four years and probably over one-thousand cups of coffee ground, I never needed to do a second of maintenance. This grinder is great for travel, and has been to Afghanistan and back with me.\n\nThe absolutely ONLY possible criticism of this grinder to consider is that it takes three to five minutes of steady, fast grinding to grind a full load of beans, which makes about two eight ounce cups of French-pressed coffee. This isn\u2019t a big deal to me, and it is a manual grinder, so this met my expectations; however, if you haven\u2019t used a manual grinder before, you may be surprised by how long that three to five minutes feels."

For myself, 74 years old, I found it difficult to use. I bought this for the occasional mistaken purchase of whole bean instead of ground coffee. I read the directions carefully. I needed a rubber grip to hold the canister steady, and it did take at least a couple hundred turns of the handle to make one cup of coffee. I'm glad it wasn't set to fine grind!"

            "reviewText": "This grinder makes really inconsistent grounds. I've tried adjusting it several times and still get grounds that are hard to brew. Half of them are very fine and would be good for a pour over or esspresso while the other half are larger and would work better for a French press. The handle is also difficult to turn at times. The one thing is has going for it is that it's small and easy to transport. If you just need a little grinder for camping or other travel it would probably work fine. If you're looking to make a quality cup of coffee everyday this probably isn't the grinder for you."

I usually use 2 tablespoons every morning so it takes over half an hour to get 2 tablespoons. I have adjusted and readjusted the burrs to no avail. I think I will find a steel burr grinder as opposed to ceramic burrs. If you're grinding flax seed this grinder is not it. Not sure how it does for coffee beans since I don't drink coffee. I will add that the actual grind size is nice I just don't have the time or the patience to grind for more than half an hour. And I also know this was not billed as a spice or seed grinder but someone in the q & a section said they use it with success which was why I chose it. I am only writing to let others know that while it does work... it takes way more time than I care to put in."

It feels solid and really well made. The window at the bottom so I can see how much ground I have left is a really nice touch. And it's portable, which is nice. 100% would buy again."
