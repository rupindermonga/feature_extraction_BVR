Only takes a couple of minutes to grind one full measure (i.e. filling the top part with beans). The handle is attached to the spindle so it won't fly off like others can. Using it for my daily brew can't rate it on ease of cleaning as i have not yet cleaned it (and probably wouldn't anyway since it will only be used for coffee). I would by again (but hope I won't need to for a while)"

But I hope you're only seeking a very similar range of sizes on the fine side. If you want espresso ground coffee, I can't recommend this grinder highly enough. It will powder your coffee very quickly. But if you have a French Press as I do, don't bother. To achieve a grind sufficiently coarse for French Press, one must loosen the grinding mechanism so much that it will, in all probability, fall off. Mine did several times. Now I reduce the grind size and cope with sludge in the bottom of my French Press. As ever, one gets what one pays for."

The main body on the inside is made entirely of plastic. The handle and the central shaft are steel and the grinder is ceramic as described, but the metal shaft and ceramic grinder are held in a plastic body. Durability may be a problem over time. Having said that, I am very pleased with the performance and the ease and consistency of the grind. My coffee certainly tastes better in this hand grinder than in my electric burr grinder. So...5 stars for performance, but 3 stars for construction -- therefore 4 stars total."

The adjustment for fine vs. coarse is a little difficult to figure out since it has no calibration, so it's hard to tell what setting it's on. Having said that, whatever setting I have it on, it works perfectly. It does require a firm grip on the cylinder, but the grinding handle is smooth and easy to rotate. Couldn't be more delighted."

There was paperwork with the grinder that implied that the company would send a second item (free?) and wanted you to sign up for email etc. I'm all for having a second one and all but the paperwork, the way it was done, said if I gave my email I'd spend the rest of my life being spammed. It was odd, poor marketing material because it definitely came off on the spammy side. Maybe whoever did it was just trying to be overly happy but it sure drove me away. If it was just overly happy, I still would suggest to the company that they redo it more professionally and make it clear where the company is, that they have privacy rules and what those are and that they aren't going to spam you."

            "reviewText": "First impression out of the box: Parts fit well and ergonomics are excellent. Information card is surprisingly clear and concise. It is difficult to actually determine the course to fine settings, but with a little trial and error there is a small difference in the grind. Given 3 or 4 settings it is not that noticeable. Low 'gear ratio' requires many turns to grind 20g of beans and some time and patience is required. The result is consistent and yields a surprising good grind for espresso. Small, compact and lightweight is particularly suited to traveling, camping or at home during a power outage or daily single serving brews. Only time will tell if the plastic internal parts can withstand daily use, but its not a huge concern since it is covered by a lifetime warranty.. Overall, a well designed handy grinder that adequately fills the need if or when you have one."

I tried it out this morning with my French press and the coffee tasted great! I ground a second batch to make cold brew. Looking forward to that.\nI noticed pictures of people using battery powered drills on the small grinders and I understand why. It takes a LOT of cranking to get the coffee ground, so I tried using a drill. MUCH FASTER. I ran my drill at a very low speed because I didn\u2019t want to damage the grinder and it worked perfectly. I removed the handle and put the retaining nut back on so I didn\u2019t damage the threads. Worked like a champ!\nWill post an update if things change, but so far, very impressed!"

            "reviewText": "Overall this grinder is excellent for the price, and will save you $70 on a decent burr grinder (do not buy a cheap electrical burr, trust me). That being said, it is not a good product for me.\n\nA bit of context, if you know how burr grinders work and why coffee snobs like me prefer them, skip this bit: the whole point of a burr grinder is to be able to create grounds of adjustable sizes ranging from coarse (big chunks) to fine (tiny chunks). The reason for this is that different coffee brew methods require different grind sizes. Every burr grinder is different, and it takes a bit of experimentation to get the grind size just right for a given brew method.\n\nThe problem with this grinder is that, once I've found the perfect spot on the dial for my espresso I have no way to mark that and remember it. This sucks because I often switch brew methods, from drip to pour over to french press etc, so every time I switch brew methods I need to experiment again to find that perfect setting.\n\nOtherwise this grinder is excellent for the price. The grind is nice and even, it's easy to operate (not too tiring, doesn't take long), and easy to disassemble and clean. If you need a cheap burr to bring your espresso to the next level then look no further. If you need a burr to satisfy all your brewing needs, be it pour over or french press, then you should probably keep looking."

I'm not ready to go for an electric so looked for a reliable solid manual that wasn't too big to clutter the storage space but large enough to grind for 1-2 shots. This one fits the requirements perfectly! It is as compact as you will likely find and yet it has a millstone approach to the grinding (no blade cutting). Crank handle folds in, the unit comes apart easily with a simple twist in 2 places. Grind coarseness is adjustable by turning a wing-nut tighter or looser. Hopper holds about 22 gm of beans, the lower compartment catches the grounds nicely and a twist of the base and it is removed to allow pouring into whatever you plan to steep the coffee with. Note that while you do have to turn the crank a while to get a scoop of beans ground up, it's much quieter than an electric units i've heard before. It takes less than a couple minutes to grind up a scoop (17 gm) of beans. Cleanup is easy, as the parts come apart easily."

First l really like the size and shape of this grinder. It\u2019s triangular and easy to hold. It has a solid feel to it. The size makes it easy to pack with my AeroPress. The grind size is easily adjustable and consistent. I really appreciate the handle folding design which offers better leverage while closing up to save space (plus it stops you from turning the grinder counter-clockwise which would damage it). The cost is very reasonable so the price point for the quality. As for cleaning I\u2019ll tell you that this design is so easy and no mess. With the electric grinder I\u2019d have coffee grounds (and powder) all over the place by the time I was done."

Then keep cranking it and the ground beans will come out into the plastic part. Make sure you only turn the crank clockwise. Turning it counterclockwise might cause damage. The actual grinder part where you put the whole beans is a bit hard to clean. I used a small brush but it doesn't reach the crevices very well and the part beneath the blades still has coffee stains on it. It does work as intended but you also get an arm workout from using it. I take that as a good thing, because it feels like I'm getting in some of my daily work out haha."

            "reviewText": "Yesterday evening I received my package. I was excited, but it was too late for coffee. So I took the grinder out of the box, and it was modestly wrapped. The instruction manual is straightforward and straight forward, showing the features of this little grinder.\n\nTaking it out and inspecting the grinder, the first thing I notice is that it fits neatly in the palm of my hand and is very comfortable to hold. The handle that will operate the grinder itself is set at a reasonable distance so that I don't wrack my knuckles by hitting the grinder itself and the rotating action is smooth and easy.\n\nTaking the grinder apart is a snap. Just rotate around 15 degrees, and the reservoir comes apart from the bottom, and the top comes away just as easy. On the bottom of the grinder, you can open the gap to set the type of grind, fine to coarse.\n\nThe next morning is coffee time :) and using this grinder is a snap. I agree with others that it takes a while to use, but it is manual. If one is used to an electric grinder, this is slower, but it is not slow. This grinder works well and produces a great grind. The coffee is ground the way I'd expect, and I can see using this no my business travel, camping, or when I don't want to plug in my electric grinder. I use my Keurig with a solo fill, and this grinder works perfectly for that amount of coffee.\n\nGet this grinder for yourself. It is worth every penny."

With the construction of this one, there is more support to prevent a twisting force from breaking the snaps that hold the mechanism closed. The Bialetti was purely plastic with no additional support on the outside. This product is surrounded and supported by steel. I don\u2019t anticipate this product from breaking! Additionally it is much more smooth as well and requires less force to grind. I enjoy very fine ground coffee for pour overs, and this product gives a better tasting cup of coffee. I attribute this to the very fine and uniform grounds. It took longer to grind the coffee, which I initially thought was a negative, however after using it several times I\u2019ve learned it is because of the fine grounds I\u2019m using and it\u2019s uniformity."

Echoing all the other reviews, it's the perfect size for this, the handle folds up and it packs easily, and I've only made one cup so far to test it out but based on that it seems to hold about 8-10 cups worth of beans, depending how strong you brew. More than enough for most of the traveling I do.\n\nI'm also going to use it sometimes as a spice grinder so it was important to me that it be easy to clean and not hang onto smells (too badly, I understand it's eventually going to smell like coffee no matter what). So far it's perfect. Again, just a test, I made one cup of coffee yesterday, then cleaned and dried it overnight and ground some whole allspice this morning. After it was done drying I tapped it on the counter to shake out lingering coffee grounds. The allspice came out with no coffee smell or taste, and I washed the grinder again right away and it doesn't smell like allspice now as it's drying. It also handled the allspice, which is harder than coffee beans, with very little protest.\n\nI see getting 2-3 years of frequent use out of it. Great for the price and will keep one more electric device out of my kitchen for at least that much longer.\n\nIf it continues working this well and seems sturdy I will probably get another just for spices."

Adjust from there.\n\nBecause you will be turning the crank a lot (!0 I particularly like the rounded triangular shape of the grinder because of how well if fits in your hand while grinding. While the grinding handle is a bit awkwardly designed because of the \"fold\" I appreciate how the additional length reduces the effort required to make a circuit.\n\nI really excellent acquisition that could also be useful for traveling because of the compact size.

To make a pot for two, however, takes two fills of beans - which is enough to fill the bottom part with a sufficient quantity of ground coffee. The challenge is that it takes quite a while to grind the coffee. It's more workout that meditation ;-) I will be acquiring an electric grinder for daily use. I do like the quality of the burr ground coffee."

I declined, which also drove me to try the JavaPresse. Which I find it better for holding the handle while grinding. Also JavaPresse has helpful guidance on adjusting the grind for the kind of coarseness, which i found to be very helpful. JavaPresse hopper seems to hold bit more beans than the Wheroamoz, helpful for my drip/cone.\n\nExcept for the above I still like Wheroamoz, but their unethical practice is bothersome to Amazon reviews. Changing to 4-stars."

This time I decided to spend more money for a higher quality product. The Wheroamoz grinder looks and feels more solid, and the extending grinder arm decreases the effort needed to grind. The reason I am giving this only 3 stars is because the capacity is much less than that of the cheaper grinders. I estimate that I can grind about 25% less beans than before. Not a big deal, but the need to refill the grinder was unexpected. Also, the capacity of the grinder is not advertised as it should be, given that the prevalent manual grinders on the market have a significantly larger capacity. I know this because I have bought multiple other brands of manual ceramic burr grinders and they were all nearly identical and appeared to come from the same manufacturer and all had a higher capacity than this Wheroamoz model."

I'm pretty sure I just sucked at using the electric grinder too, however, this portable boi grinds coffee quite uniformly, with an impressive range of coarseness customization.\nAlso, I've found that I really enjoy grinding my coffee by hand; it makes me feel closer to the coffee (If that makes any sense).\nTL;DR GRANTS YOU POWER OVER COFFEE BEANS!

My first grind was with some Tim Horton's beans I just bought, and even though I didn't get the grounds-water ratio correct, the coffee is already much better (less muddy and murky tasting) than before.

I will say that I brewed cold brew with coarser grounds and it worked pretty well but usually I have it on a much finer setting for my daily cup.

            "reviewText": "This coffee grinder has a huge range from Expresso to French Press. It\u2019s extremely easy to use even on the finest settings. It seems to have nice high quality burrs. The construction feels very sturdy with a stainless steel body. The grind holder is made from plastic. But it seems to be a high-quality and durable plastic at that. The handle is also stainless steel with a very smooth spin and grind. The foldable handle is definitely a nice touch for travel, dorms etc. I would definitely recommend it! For travel or for every day use.\nSo my conclusion is it\u2019s definitely a high-quality grinder for a great price! Five stars!"

The quick disconnect (about 10 deg rotation) of the top crank for filling with beans and the bottom grounds container have a very nice detent that seem well engineered. The crank has some resistance so cranking is exercise. I never owned a grinder before so it was a little bit disappointing to spend 90 seconds grinding to get enough grounds for one strong cup of coffee. However there is nothing smells better than fresh grounds. Opt for a powered grinder if you make coffee by the pot."

It's not as fast as an electric one but it's really not that bad, takes about a min. or two to grind beans for about 4 cups of coffee. If you are trying to make a large batch it might be best to get an electric grinder, but this is great for coffee for one or two people. It doesn't make noise, like loud electric ones. Never have to worry about electricity going out and great for travel. I love it and have a feeling it will last a lot longer than my last automatic one will."

I've tried to straighten the pin; no go. It has been riveted in place and this, too, is turning (rivets shouldn't turn: they should be tight fasteners). Poor QA/QC. I might remove the rivet and replace with a \"real\" rotatable knob with bearing; thank goodness for power tools!\n\nNot sure if I'd buy this again due to the knob issue."

If you are planning to use the grinder for both spice and coffee beans, I think you want to order two, since if you are grinding to a fine setting, it will not be easy to clean the grinder of all leftover residual without giving it a good rinse and a day to dry out."

It's certainly not an electric grinder, it takes some time to grind and took filling it a couple times to make enough for a pot of coffee but that's to be expected. I got this because I travel and camp in my van quite a bit and I would much rather grind up some coffee just before I make it rather than grinding it beforehand. It's compact and perfect for traveling. I don't make espresso myself but it should work great for that as well with a finer grind."

This makes a difference when using a french press, coffee maker, percolator, pour over etc. I really like this little added feature because with most coffee grinders you do not get this option to choose how fine you want your grounds, unless youre at the grocery store and use their machine or have a high class coffee grinders at home. I also love the fact its quiet unlike a electric grinder."

I was really excited to get my hands on a good quality!manual bur grinder that was the right size for a single or double cup of espresso. I was especially pleased that I would not have to spend tons of money to get a five-star reviewed model. I realize heavily on other consumer reviews when I'm deciding on purchases and have found in the past people to be pretty honest when they love a product they say so if they take the time to leave a negative review it's generally because the product inconvenienced or bothered them enough with it's features (or lack thereof) to try to help other consumers make educated purchases. I found it on when I open the package that there was a card inside appearing to tempt the buyer with a \"free gift\" \"all\" they had to do was \"leave a five-star review.\"\n\nI gave two stars because using it is pretty simple and I do enjoy smelling my coffee while I'm hand-grinding it. It also gives it pretty consistent size ground. That's where the compliments end. Unless you were looking to grind 5 to 10 beans at a time and waste a good portion of beans that would not grind enough to pass through the burrs on the fine setting- which is the suggested setting for espresso- I recommend literally any other model grinder. Super disappointing that a company is allowed to farm for five star likes with the lure of the free gift. Extremely dishonest. Do not recommend."

Takes a while to grind them as well. Wife used it and was getting tired as she ground just enough beans for a single serving. We ground a small amount and it took longer than expected.\n\nI guess if you travel and absolutely must grind your own coffee, this would be ok since it's compact.

            "reviewText": "The grinder itself is excellent, but I took off a star because they did not include *any* instructions regarding how the device should be cleaned. It was not difficult to figure out, but I wasted significant time looking for that information online, in order to avoid possibly damaging the device in the course of disassembling it.\n\nI wanted to clean the device before using it for the first time, as I have no way of knowing whether it was created and packaged in a clean environment.\n\nTo clean it, I ended up doing the following:\n\n* Twist the clear chamber on the bottom to unlock it, and remove it from the body.\n* While holding the crank in place, use fingers to unscrew the plastic fastener that controls the coarseness of the grind until it comes off. Be careful because it is spring-loaded.\n* Place the removed fastener to one side, remembering its orientation.\n* Remove the ceramic internal grinding part that was under the fastener. Be careful because it is spring-loaded. Place it to one side, remembering its orientation.\n* Remove the lock washer that is under the grinding part and place it to one side, remembering its orientation.\n* Unscrew the cylindrical threaded cap on top completely.\n* Remove the crank handle.\n* Clean each part with dishwashing liquid and water. Be careful with the inner and outer ceramic grinding parts, as they are very abrasive, and also, quite breakable if they are dropped.\n* When finished, re-assemble everything as it was before by reversing the order of the above steps. Be especially careful when pushing the bottom plastic fastener onto the spring-loaded inner ceramic grinding part; pressure must be maintained against the spring while turning until the thread engages.\n* Turn the bottom plastic fastener clockwise to attain the proper degree of fineness for the grind that you intend to create.\n\nI'll note that another reviewer said that she avoided the detailed disassembly by just removing the two ends of the device and then cleaning the clear plastic receiving chamber and rinsing through the central shaft. I did not try that; it might work OK and thus avoid a lot of effort."

            "reviewText": "I like to grind my own coffee beans each morning. Yes, I think it makes coffee taste better, but I also find the process somehow therapeutic. Taking time to grind the beans helps me get focused for the day and map out my daily plan. Not really a function of this coffee grinder, but it's the reason I use the grinder.\n\nI have an electric grinder, but it's loud and isn't great for grinding one cup's worth of beans. If I need to grind a lot a time, then the electric works well, but this manual grinder is quick, quiet and easy to use for a single cup. Plus I can easily throw it in my bag along with a handful of beans and I can make coffee when I travel!\n\nAs for the grinder itself, I find the quality very good. I really like that the top cap and bottom cup both lock into place. No issues with them popping open during grinding and spilling grounds everywhere. It's easy to adjust the grind and I find that this grinder will grind extremely fine if I'm using my Aeropress, or very course if I'm using a French Press. It obviously will do any grind in between too.\n\nIt's a simple device, easy to use and does exactly what I want it do to. Construction is sturdy and should last a long time. At this price, I'd definitely buy again if I lost, broke or somehow damaged this unit. I have no issues throwing it in my suitcase for travel. Fits my needs."

            "reviewText": "As a coffee enthusiasts for decades, I appreciate a nifty grinder like this!\nIt creates a consistent grind for your coffee.\nPROS:\n* Ceramic Burr - easily grinds beans for the best taste\n* folding handle - Makes it easy for travel AND no more losing the handle like other designs!\n* LOCKS! the chamber locks into place so you don't have to worry about the containers coming apart or dropping (which is a problem of other designs). The handle top locks into place as well.\n* See Thru chamber - this is MY FAVORITE feature. Especially after you clean or adjust your grinder, you need to check the grind to adjust for course or fine. So CONVENIENT!\n\nCONS:\nReassembly: There is not simple way to remember how to reassemble the unit when you take it apart. I highly recommend you take a video of yourself as you take it apart or at least take photographs along the way. If you\u2019re not paying attention or are not mechanicall inclined.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nThis is a great grinder unit that has two advantages over competitors: The see thru chamber and the locks so it doesn\u2019t come apart during use or travel.\nThe reassembly could be fine tuned with either writing down and drawing your own diagram, but if you do it enough, it becomes easier. Most grinders will require cleaning at least once a week to maintain cleanliness and purity of flavor as old grind and beans can go rancid and taint the flavor"

            "reviewText": "I just received this today. I did the recommended test grind and it worked well. I didn't turn the little knob on the crank because the fine grounds are perfect for us. It can be set to coarse or fine. I purchased without the lifetime warranty, and I would recommend it. I might add, there are three parts to it. The top you turn right to open the top. The bottom (where the arrows are) turn right to open. Put the beans in the middle section, attach the top then attach the clear plastic catcher. It's not difficult to figure out, but those instructions aren't in there. It will grind 20 gms of beans, which turns out to be 4 scoops (we use five for ten mugs of coffee, so that's a downside, not enough to take a star though). The only concern I have is the plastic for the grinder itself. Which is why I am going to get the lifetime warranty. We have rolling blackouts coming our way through the fire season, and I am stocking up on *things that will make my life easier* i.e. the coffee grinder and a few other items.\n\nWith my Coleman grill and camp set, I'll never worry about running out of daily coffee. Also, this travel well. I will check in after a month and update on the plastic grinder portion."

This item fits the bill nicely. This grinder is adjustable & takes a little messing around to find your preferred setting, but once you find it, you'll know. The only issue I have had, is when using different flavored coffees, the flavor can sometimes get trapped. I spoke with my coffee guru who recommended taking some dry rice & grinding it through. This trick works well & also helps to clean the grinder as well. The only issue/concern I have is that I have never owned a different grinder, so I cannot comment on it's quality/skill versus other grinders. All I can say is that this fits my needs perfectly, works well for my purpose, & is very reasonably priced. I have used this iteI love this item. Highly recommended!"

I have a French press, a piston type press and recently a pour over carafe dripper and each uses a different grind and with this I can keep my beans fresh and use them and grind accordingly. For the price, this is great quality and most important of all is its consistent in grinding coffee as you want it...

It's well made and operates very smoothly. The grind is easily adjusted to the precise coarseness for making great espresso. The bottom is made of clear plastic material so it is easy to keepp trake of how much coffee is being ground. This bottom detaches with a simple twist so the coffee can be easily transferred to the espresso machine.\n\nI really could not ask for anything better."

It's perfect for travel when paired with a portable espresso maker. I grind while the portable espresso maker is pre-heating.\n\nI roast my own beans so I also use this to grind for cupping. It's so convenient to grind a small batch and takes about the same amount of time as loading an electric grinder.\n\nAlso - exercise makes coffee taste better."

The only downside is that it's way slower since you have to turn the knob manually. The grinder is made of pretty good material and it's sturdy."

The ground coffee seems to pick up a static charge and makes a minor mess. My next biggest complaint is having another gadget sitting on the kitchen counter with a cord getting in the way. I actually like using the mortar and pestle better than any of the electric grinders I've used. This manual grinder from Wheroamoz is my favorite of all the grinders I've used. It is small enough to not get in the way, large enough to grind for a 3 or 4 cup plunge pot, doesn't have a power cord to contend with, the fineness of grind is consistent, and the grinds don't develop a static charge."

Full chamber fill the the chamber of ground coffee by 80%,(+10% to bean chamber -10% to ground coffee chamber would be better for me ) which just little bit less than my morning doze, may be it'll help me to reduce my coffee consumption."

I prefer using a manual ceramic burr as compared to stainless steel and so far the product is not a disappointment. Easy to clean as well. I am using a small fine bristle soft toothbrush to clean the burr itself. If only this product comes with its own brush, that will complete it. Anyway still an amazing product for coffee lovers."
