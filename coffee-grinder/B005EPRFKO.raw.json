            "reviewText": "I\u2019ve had it for about a week, I\u2019ve used it every morning since I got it. I\u2019m totally happy with it. It says it\u2019s a lot quieter than other brands, I\u2019d believe that it is. Obviously it\u2019s not silent but it\u2019s probably 1/3 as loud as an average blender, so it\u2019s decent. It\u2019s quick and easy to use, put your beans in, put the cap on, push the button a few times to grind em up, maybe one longer burst to really get them ground.\n\nThings you should know/other people\u2019s complaints:\n\nSomeone said that it\u2019s \u201cno good, it leaves chunks of beans\u201d. This doesn\u2019t happen to me, but my guess is that they\u2019re not grinding the beans enough or they\u2019re somehow over filling it. While grinding you can tip it upside down in between bursts of the motor to mix it around better.\n\n\u201cIt makes a mess, coffee grounds everywhere!\u201d The cap is a cup. When your coffee beans (or spices) are fully ground, tip it upside down and pull the machine out of the cap, and you won\u2019t spill anything.\n\n\u201cThe motor burnt out after just a few uses\u201d so obvisouly I haven\u2019t had this for more than a week so I can\u2019t yet say it should last forever. It probably won\u2019t, but for $15 if I have to buy a new one every year or two, I can live with that. It could\u2019ve also just been a faulty unit... stuff happens. BUT basically don\u2019t just hold down the button so the motor and blades spin continuously. In stead to short bursts like you\u2019re revving a motorcycle... this will break the big pieces into smaller pieces, and shoot them around and mix them up so the blades aren\u2019t working so hard. Then after a few bursts when it\u2019s mostly ground up, you can hold it a bit longer to make sure there aren\u2019t chunks left. I like my coffee a little coarse (its definitely not espresso ground... see photos).\n\n\u201cThe cord is too short\u201d... yeah the bottom is also a cap that pulls straight down and then you can unwrap the power cable. Though, even unspooled, the cord is pretty short... it\u2019s the only thing I don\u2019t like about this device... it can only be about a foot from an outlet. I deal with it, but it\u2019s the one thing I would change about it.\n\nFor a cheap, tabletop grinder I don\u2019t see how it could be beat. It\u2019s pretty easy to clean (the top washes just like a cup, and the part where the beans sit on the blades pulls out like a cup as well). It works great and I\u2019m totally satisfied for what it is."

Love it.\nCan also stop grinding earlier if you want to make it not quite so fine.\nCord hides inside the machine.\n\nCons.\nCord is short.\nA bit small. Need to load and grind twice for a sufficient quantity of coffee, but I like mine strong, so that may be subjective.\nThe interior does not come out of the machine that easily; you have to pull on it. Pull on it too hard, and it'll come out, but your coffee dust will go all over your face. So you have to do it slow, or you have to flip the entire machine over and give it a love tap on the bottom to get the coffee out.\n\nDo I recommend this machine? Heck yes. Its cheap as heck, it'll last forever, and really, how much do you want to pay for a dang coffee grinder?"

            "reviewText": "I bought this item a few weeks ago and wanted to give it at least a dozen uses before reviewing. That being said, I can't yet say that this item stands the test of time. On top of that, I use this not to grind up coffee beans, but for other things. I bought this item to make powders, such as dried pepper powders, dried mushroom powders and the like.\n\nPROS: given that I'm using this for purposes not intended by the manufacturer, it's doing a good job. I like how fine my end product is.\n\nIt's cheap! Even if it worked 75% as good as it does, I would say this is a steal.\n\nI love how the grinder compartment comes apart, and despite recommendations against, I still hand wash the detachable parts and let air dry for a good day. I still hand clean the main part with a dry or very light damp paper, sit it upside down and and let it dry a good day. No problems here, but again, the manufacturer (and pretty much everyone else) advises against this. I'm just lazy, and the subsequent powder gets everywhere, which leads me to the cons.\n\nCONS: this thing does a great job grinding up stuff, but it often results in a powdery smoke afterwards, which often escapes while grinding. This smoke gets everywhere including into the mechanics of the grinder. I'm hoping this doesn't cause issues down the road. Additionally, if you're like me and using this for other than coffee purposes, get a cheap face mask, especially when grinding hot peppers.\n\nThe mechanism that spins the grinding blades doesn't always fit snugly and when I was first using this, it gave off a plastic burn smell. It's gone away after 6 uses or so, but it was initially concerning.\n\nThat's the big summation. Despite the few issues, this item warrants a 5 star, if nothing else, because it does more than just expected and is very cost effective. If this lasts 6 months with my usage (grinding all sorts of dried things 2 times a week) then I will have made out."

It wasn't dropped or mishandled in any way. My husband has an ohm meter that he checked it with and without opening it up thinks a wire or the motor just burned out possibly. Too late to send it back so I will choose another of a different brand and hope for better luck. I think I will get a manual grind the next time. Less to go wrong with it. It was great while it lasted though."

            "reviewText": "This is perfect for fine grinding and I like that the whole cup removes & can be washed out. I must not have read the description right, as I thought it had a \"retractable\" cord - when it actually just winds around the bottom - but you pull the bottom down to unwind it and rewind it, thus most of the cord is concealed when not in use. It turns flax seed into dust in seconds (perfect for making Gundry's cinnamon/flaxseed muffin in a mug)! A great little grinder at a great price! Highly recommend!"

The cap is very easy to fill with beans, the on switch very easy to use, does a great job of grinding, and it is very easy to brush the remaining coffee out. This is also very easy to clean.\n\nI think one of the reasons why this grinder is so easy to use is because the parts are so accessible, and easy to hold in your hand. In comparison, the Mr. Coffee grinder didn't fit well in your hand, and the parts weren't spaced well.\n\nI have been using this grinder for about 10 months now without a problem. I love it."

            "reviewText": "I had a hamilton beach coffee grinder for years that I loved. I dropped it and broke the cover and switch. In my coffee deprived stupor I quickly ordered another hamilton beach coffee grinder here on amazon. The previous grinder was a gift so I don't know what it cost. I figured this particular one would be equivalent. Unfortunately, the lid doesn't \"lock\" on like my previous one so I've dumped coffee several times trying to pick the grinder up by the top. I also don't like the manual cord wrap around - it's too much trouble so I never use it and the cord dangles - but that's just me being lazy. The previous hamilton beach had settings for how many cups you were grinding and what consistency you wanted the beans ground up. This particular grinder has one setting and that's it. Also, the previous grinder had a fairly large capacity space for coffee beans. This one barely holds 5 tbsps of coffee beans and w/ a 12 cup coffee brewer I want 6 tbsps of coffee beans so I'm constantly \"stacking\" the beans up and trying to get the lid on quickly before spilling beans every where. But again, that's my personal preference. This grinder does a good job of grinding and is quieter than the previous one. I don't wake up the other people in the house and make the dogs bark when I use this one. I've also used it to grind spices and it does a very nice job w/ that. So, the only reason I'm giving it four stars instead of five is because I think it's needs a locking lid, a larger capacity, and a better way to wrap the cord up. Otherwise, it's done a fine job of keeping me in caffeine every morning."

            "reviewText": "I have a small area at the end of my kitchen countertop that I've made into a sort of mini coffee bar, with a lazy susan holding all of my coffee supplies. This very compact little grinder is the perfect size for this. Even the cord wraps around a little space at the bottom and then is covered by pushing up on the bottom, so only the end hangs out while not in use. The blades work great, and it only takes seconds to grind enough coffee for about 8-10 cups. That's about the max amount of beans you can fit at one time. A quick clean up is very easy with just a damp paper towel, but the clear middle blade section and the clear dome top both separate easily to clean more thoroughly. This is my first coffee grinder and I love it. I plan to buy a couple more for family members as gifts. The coffee just tastes so much fresher and better. (Measure a little more fresh-ground coffee out than you would with the pre-ground, as fresh-ground doesn't have all the fillers, and comes out sort of 'fluffier', or less dense than the pre-ground)."

You do have to hold down the button, but I hold the grinder in both hands and use my thumb - not a problem if you have worries about pressing a button. It takes 20 seconds to a fine grind with 2 Tb coffee beans. It is easy to clean as you only have to wipe out the cup, then drop it back into the grinder and give it the slight twist. Overall it's a very good value and I'm happy with it. My former Hamilton Beach grinder lasted for years with daily use, so I looked for another HB."

I put a little cheat line on the back in silver sharpie. Big bonus.\nSize is similar to most which in my opinion is too damn small. Takes two batches to make a pot. But seems it's the industry standard for a stand alone. Good enough for my purposes.\n\nThe performance is great though. Really lets you pound those beans to a dust if you need.

And it does it well enough to provide coffee grounds I can then put into my Kuerig machine and get a really great cup of coffee.\n\nSo when using it, it helps to first use it in bursts to break down the beans. Then running it longer to get the coarse grounds into a diner consistency. One thing this grinder does not have is another compartment to store the grounds. So you have to make what you are going to use, or store them somewhere else. Generally when grinding coffee beans you want to grind them when you are going to use them anyway.\n\nThe other little annoyance is that removing the grounds is a little tricky because they get caught under the blade. No biggie at this price point.\n\nI am happy with this product."

            "reviewText": "Extremely fast and easy to use and clean. I chose this unit because the hopper (grinding chamber) and lid are removable and dishwasher safe. Easy to remove, very much like a little blender. Built in cord storage with cover is very handy. Cord isn't retractable; you have to pop off the cover, wind the cord around the center, and replace the cover. Very basic but hardworking small appliance.\nProcesses up to 6 Tablespoons of coffee, or up to 3 T. of spices. I use it to grind peppercorns; works great for that. There's no adjustment for how fine your result will be; that's controlled by how long you grind. If you like a specific grind, this could take a little practice. Smaller amounts take less time to reach desired fineness, so I find it best to \"pulse\" the grinder to get to that point. All in all, a great value for a basic coffee/spice grinder at this price."

I have found that I must fill the unit to the max two times in order to make the coffee strong enough for my husband and I to drink. I wish the chamber was larger. Other than that, it's easy to lean and very small so if space is an issue this will fit the bill."

I was making chickpea flour in my food processor and it couldn't finish the job, but this little guy did! I had to do it in small batches, but it took the clumpy mess of dried chickpea pieces and made it into flour. The sound for me is not too bad. I ran it while my toddler slept in the other room and he didn't budge.\n\nThe cord comes wrapped up in a little base on the bottom that slides down. It's nice, but not a big deal for me.\nThe pieces come off nicely for cleaning or when you need to dump out whatever you ground up.\nCleaning it isn't the easiest, but not crazy hard either. You can't take out the blade... I think LOL But I have been soaking the blade part for a minute then rinsing well.\n\nSo, it is great for making things into fine powders. I love that I can buy the seed version of seasonings and not have to run out for ground versions. I think this was a smart purchase."

My coffee no longer taste like cheap sludge and I am able to buy beans (from my favorite local coffee shop), run them in this grinder, put a scoop in my reusable K-cup and have a nice, bold, more environmentally friendly cup of coffee. Plus, it is way cheaper to buy these things in the long run than to buy premise k-cups. I will say, they grinder portion is a bit harder to clean to keep it from getting some water in it but it\u2019s not enough to deter me from buying it again."

I pulse this about 20 times to get to the grind size I like to use in the Aeropress, but I do have to watch out for the wayward bean or two that doesn't make it through the grind. I like using the top as a cup after the grinding is done. With the lid still on the unit, I flip the unit over and then remove the lid down, setting the unit upright and lidless. It's easier to transfer the grounds to my Aeropress this way! I know you can remove the cup, but I just don't do it that way. :) Overall, it's a good product so far."

I didn't want a jet engine on my counter, nor a mess. And I needed something at a very reasonable price. I have to say I'm surprised how much I love this new coffee tool. The grinding noise is at a very reasonable level, considering its function, and the grind comes out perfectly for my purposes. I love the removable cup - a huge difference from turning the whole thing upside down to get the grinds out. There's a little trick to easily getting the grind-cup in and out, and once you figure it out, it works beautifully. Now we'll see if it lasts, which it does seem well-built. If it dies, I'll repost again. If you don't hear back, it lives on."

I've used for other items (although probably not recommended) and it always meets or exceeds my needs. SIMPLE simple to use which means a great deal to me because i dislike anything with the slightest complexity. I would certainly recommend for any user since you don't need a science degree to remove, clean, use or replace the cover/parts. Safe for those little fingers roaming around the house since you can't make it run without the cover and a child would have to have a hand large enough to hold the device and press the button. Although I have no issues with the pressing and holding the power button i could see someone with limited dexterity or arthritis might have difficulty pressing and holding the button down for any length of time. You can't leave it to do the job you have to be there to hold the button, for these users i may tend to be an issue but it does chop very quickly. Again great for travel due to the compact size but it. weighs more than you would think, not flimsy."

I have been wanting a coffee grinder for some time, and trust the hamilton Beach name brand and it was priced well so I thought I would give it a try. I love that the bottom pulls out so that you can wind the cord up out of the way. Makes storage a lot easier and more compact. Another thing I like is it will grind enough coffee for a whole 12 cup coffee pot. I don't have to grind in batches. It has an easy to see fill line so I just fill to that line, push the button and grind for 20 seconds, flip it over and the coffee goes into the see through cup on the top. Take the top off and pour it right into my coffee maker. You can't get any easier than that. I am also very happy with how fine it grinds the coffee. I was able to get all of that yummy goodness out of the bean. I would highly recommend this coffee grinder and will be telling friends and family about how well it works."

H.M. does not respect people that are not in their time zone. I've never had such a bad talk with any other company. My final advice on this matter, If you purchase from H P because of their low prices, If something is wrong with the purchase be prepared for a large program to try to fix it."

I've had mine for about a year now and I've used this thousands of times. I grind with it every day at least a few times and it's ground everything from nuts and seeds to peppercorns. I read where someone asked if it would grind up dog food into a powder and although I've never tried it, I bet it would. I can grind almonds into almond butter with mine, literally.\n\nI don't know why I've had such good luck with mine, compared to the other reviews on here, but mine's worked Great! Maybe in how it's used makes a difference? It only takes mine about 5 seconds to grind coffee beans and if I'm grinding nuts, I'll pulse it, let it run a few seconds, stop, let it run a few seconds, stop, and keep doing that till the nuts are the consistency I like. If I want really fine powder, I'll grind the almonds or others for maybe 10 seconds and that literally makes them into a butter. I fill up the cup too to max. I don't know if that makes a difference. I've never really tried mine with just a few seeds or such. I always fill the lid up to the line and even top it off with coffee beans since they grind up to less than max when done. Then after each use I make sure to scrape everything out too. I imagine if you let the grinds keep building up underneath the blades, it'll jam up pretty fast. I always make sure I keep mine fairly clean and besides, who wants leftover grindings with your new grindings.\n\nMine's going on a year, maybe more actually and still going strong. A fluke? Maybe, but I know for a fact when this one breaks, I'm going right back and buying another one of these. Should it falter, I'll try again, and should that one falter? I'll pout and start thinking that maybe I did just get lucky after all, but, until those days come, I'm sticking with Hamilton Beach's nifty little 80335. The funnest little gadget I've ever owned ^_^\n\n(Edited in 2/23/2016 it's still going strong, used every day for all kinds of grindings; herbs, peppercorns, seeds, nuts, and, speaking of nuts, be careful because if you're grinding something such as almonds, if you don't stop this in time, you could end up with almond butter. That's the other bonus though, this is powerful enough to grind nuts into nut butter. I don't know if mine's a supermachined grinder but, this has been a rockstar in the kitchen!)"

It's loud, the motor sounded to binding up with the bearing or something because it's noise level would vary in frequency and also chatter while using it. The mechanism that holds the cup in place was difficult for my wife to untwist so shed end up using it like our old proctor one (8 years old and still works at my job) and that method makes a mess with this one. The removable container is hard to remove because there's really not a lot of grip on the sides, you have to kinda push down with your palm and twist. Which would also leave you with a ring of coffee grinds on your palm. All in all, this is a terrible grinder and expect to be shopping for a new one like me."

No twist tie needed to contain the cord.\n\n2) The blade and grinding cup is completely removable for ease of cleaning.

It's done a great job so far with the different spices I've used in it (ceylon cinnamon sticks, whole coriander, etc.) I've even used it to pulverize eggshells to use in my garden.\n\nIt really is easy to clean. The top parts come away and reassemble quickly and simply. Since I don't use it every day I appreciate that the cord stows away neatly by winding around the base.\n\nI'm not sure why I waited so long to get an electric spice grinder; it really is so much more convenient than the hand cranked types. Do yourself a favor and buy one if you like to cook: it's less than $20 and definitely worth every penny."

I do not use the grinder more than once a week these days since I bought a bigger coffee grinder, but I did grind coffee in it every morning for a little over 2 years."

            "reviewText": "I bought this grinder while waiting for the Krups to be delivered from Amazon, when our old Braun finally died. I figured after the Krups arrived, this one would become my spice and flax seed grinder. Much to my surprise, I much prefer this one to the Krups. Granted, I have only been using it (daily) for a month or so, but it does a wonderful job and is so convenient! I love that the excess cord is hidden inside, and especially that the entire grinding chamber comes out. Being able to empty the ground beans directly into the coffee maker without unplugging is so much more convenient. It also makes scraping out the chamber much easier. I also find the grinder to be quieter than the Krups and the Braun - a fact my still snoozing husband appreciates! HOWEVER - if you make 12 cups of coffee in the AM, this won't be for you. I use a slightly rounded half cup of beans to make about 8-9 cups of coffee, and the chamber is large enough for this, but not much more. Just be sure to gently tap the grinder on the countertop before opening the lid to level the beans. That way you won't spill grinds everywhere!\n\nI will update this review if the Hamilton Beach bites the dust, but so far, I really couldn't be happier."

As other reviewers have noted, it has a very short cord, but it does stash in the bottom of the machine, which is great for storage. The removable parts make it very easy to clean.\n\nI only use this occasionally, but have had no problems with it, and find that it can handle a good load of flax and grind it evenly without complaint.\n\nI looked a number of places for choosing this - as an occasional user, I didn't want to spend a lot of money. As has been said many times before - you get what you pay for. This is one of the most inexpensive grinders available. I don't expect a workhorse for this price. I expect a pony. That is what I got."

The box said it is quiet and that is true, much quieter than the many other brands I have had in the past. The coffee chamber is removable for pouring the ground coffee into the filter and for cleaning. I think that is unique among brands. I like the switch design which operates by pressing your fingers against it rather than pushing down with your thumb...this also keep grounds out of the mechanism. It also seems to grind the coffee faster than my other units (Krupp and Cuisinart). The lid is very clear, you can actually see whether the coffee is at the grind you want. So, for the price, if it lasts a year or two I will be satisfied. Will let you know if it does not."

The grinds are surprisingly consistent. It doesn't get hot. It's not too loud, I can grind away at 5am and not wake anyone in the house. I honestly can't tell the difference in taste between my $130 Baratza grinder and this wally world special. There are only three pieces, only two of which require cleaning which is easy, dishwasher safe of course.\n\nThe not so good:\nIt's easy to clean, but the way the grind chamber is designed (outer shell/inner shell), water will get caught in between the two shells and it takes a while to dry. This will not cause any issues with getting grinds wet, but if you use it every day you can expect a little bit of moisture to be caught in between the two shells. I hand wash it for time sake, but when I put it in the dishwasher I don't have this issue if I use heated dry function.\n\nThe grind chamber could be bigger as I can only get about 5 tbsp of grind if I fill it to the max with bean. So if I make my typical 6 cups, I spend about 3 minutes grinding, washing, and re-assembling the grinder after each use. Compared to the Baratza though, it's a breeze.\n\nThe blade is affixed to the grind chamber. So expect to dump your grinds into the cap (or another dish) if you wish to precisely measure.\n\nThe benefits of this unit far outweigh the not so great things. It's been so dependable that I probably won't bother reinvesting in another burr mill grinder. I'll be buying another one, to back up this one!"

I don't like the implementation on this grinder. Because the storage area is small, the cord is short. Also, the cord is made from a rather stiff plastic so that when you try to unravel it, it wants to stay curled up. With the cord fully extended and the storage cover closed the front of the grinder is now facing away from you. Another reviewer commented on the lid being a little difficult to put on. It is kind of a pain especially with a foggy pre-coffee morning brain. Another bad design feature is that it's smaller on the bottom than the top which makes it top heavy.\nWhat I do like about the grinder is the removable blade assembly. It can be rinsed out and turned upside down on a dish rack to air dry.\nIt grinds the coffee as it should - no complaints there. If not for that it would have received just one star.\n\n*Update* - The longer I use this grinder the less I like it. It's just too much of a pain. Tired of fighting with the cord and cord cover. I'll be putting it up to use less frequently for spices and purchase another for coffee."

The big reservoir allows the whole coffee beans room to move around so I don't have to hold the grinder & shake it around the entire time while it grinds to get even grind. After the coffee is ground, I can turn the large lid upside down & the deep large lid holds the grind w/o spilling when pouring the grind into my French coffee press. It's light, inexpensive, & very attractive on my kitchen counter. I highly recommend this product for those who still prefer the deep roasty taste of freshly ground coffee beans made in the traditional French coffee press as opposed to the single-cup coffee maker pods which are convenient but I don't find that coffee as delicious."

This one is actually better. You have to press the lever on the front to activate it instead of pushing a button to grind automatically. How hard is that? It seems to have a stronger motor or blades, though. I press the button for a couple of seconds a few times and get a perfect espresso grind. Easier than pressing hard on the broken one and my guess is that over a couple of years I will have saved a few kwH of electricity. I like being green. It's much, much quieter than any coffee grinder I've ever had. Because the cap is taller, it doesn't collect a lot of coffee dust and therefore needs cleaning less often. The grinding cup is a snap to clean because it easily pops out for a quick rinse. This is a great buy. Highly recommend."

At the bottom, you pull out the chord cover to expose the power chord. Just unwind, then push the cover back in. Your going to love the fact that the grinder mill is detachable. I'm sure you always hated those coffee mills that always blaringly warned: \"Do Not Immerse\". We all know that if you grind your beans to a fine powder, it's going to accumulate at the bottom of the mill, and trying to clean it out sufficiently is a pain. Hamilton Beach has solved that issue for us. An interesting point to note. The actual blade shaft does not sit firmly fixed into the grinder cup. It has some 'play', or wobble, which I assume helps when ripping into harder grains and spices. You'll like this coffee grinder. The instructions/user sheet is in English, French, & Spanish."

When you try turning or pulling it off, the ground coffee goes all over my counter or table.\n\nSecondly, I smelled a terrible burning odor as it was grinding, and the base of the unit got hot. I wouldn't recommend this for free and I'd give it zero stars if I could.\n\nIf you want a Hamilton Beach, here is the one to get. It is WONDERFUL.

I came back to a Hamilton Beach grinder after a long series of short-lived hand burr grinders and a switch to cold-brew coffee. The compact size is still the same. I miss the retractable cord, but being able to have storage space at the bottom of the base is still a huge plus. The major improvement is the motor. It's a delight to use. Quiet. Efficient. I pulse my beans until I get the grind I want and I'm all set. Glad to be back with Hamilton Beach."

My wife and I brew 8 cups each morning and I have to fill, grind, refill, grind, and even then it\u2019s not as much as we would usually use.\n\nThat said, the noise level is very quiet and the grinder is fast, compared to our previous one.

Love the easy to push button on the front. The grinder compartment does seem a little smaller than other grinders I've owned and I find needing to fill it to the top with beans when making a full pot of coffee so need to be careful when removing the \"removable\" cup so not to spill the grinds. But as my old grinder, I do love the removable cup! I find the cord storage useless and a pain and not really good for every day use. So I simply don't use it."

I got this grinder not expecting it to be much better than the failing one, but have been pleasantly surprised to find that it does a great job. It's pretty easy to finesse just how fine the beans are ground by running the grinder longer as needed. Along with that, the button on this one is actually a lot better than the one on the old grinder. The clear top on this grinder also is a plus with being able to clearly see just how much the beans are ground. Also important to note is that this grinder was on the cheaper side, especially vs. the \"premium\" worn out one we currently had. Apparently, it's not an instance of getting what you pay for, at least not this time around."

            "reviewText": "After a gift of whole bean coffee for christmas, my wife and I went out to buy a coffee Grinder. I've never owned one, so we looked for something that was easy to use and was a brand we recognized. We got this unit and paid $14.99 (or so.)\n\nPerhaps the thing that impresses me the most about this is that I can leave it on the counter top. The cord winds up in the base. Let me say this again, the cord doesn't hang out and snag on everything, or get in your way, it winds up in the base! Would that all small appliances had this feature!\n\nAs for the grinding, it's perfect. I love my coffee and from the outset this unit has worked FLAWLESSLY. As for those who wrote before about units that died, let me reiterate what the instructions say: Turn on for only a few seconds at a time. I run it for 1 - 2 second bursts about 6-10 times. Someone previously said that the blades were lose. Yes, they are designed that way, they float a bit in the grinding chamber - but they work.\n\nThe lid snaps on and you press the power button which is covered by a piece on the cover. This keeps the cover on while grinding. (Again, short bursts!)\n\nThe grinding chamber is removable, and you clean it with a dry cloth. (DON'T immerse the base OR the grinding chamber! Don't even run water into it! It will get water in between the plastic form and the metal grinding area. Yes, I say this from experience!)\n\nThis is an inexpensive grinder. If it dies in a year, I'll just replace it. But if you use it properly, the motor should last much longer than that."

For fourteen dollars, it seemed like too good a deal to pass up, so I popped one of these babies in my cart (along with a billion other things, as is typical of a Walmart trip), and used it as soon as I got home. Spoiler alert: I LOVED IT.\n\nIt's super easy to use, and I love how easily and neatly the power cord wraps up. I bought one for my sister and one for my brother for Christmas, and they, too, fell in love.

The grinder is so small and easy to handle and pick up, when I'm done grinding my coffee I leave the lid on, turn it upside down and give it a pulse, and the coffee grinds fall right into the top acting like a little cup and then I just pour it straight from the lid and pack it into my brew basket.

For espressos you need a finer grain. It works so well,I'm truly impressed. Really easy to use! Comes with a measuring spoon so you get the right amount. Just add the beans to the colander. Snap the lid back on. The cord is a great design. You can twist the cord back up on the bottom of the grinder and push the bottom part up to cover the cord. It's really cool. Once plugged in,hit the button. You can hear the consistency of the grind.Easy to clean. just take a damp cloth and wipe excess grinds out of the cylinder and lid. I put mine back into the box it came in,to keep the instructions and such together. I really do love this grinder. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!"

Takes some practice to get it to work the way you want.\n- Easy to overfill. You want to do it just below (rather than at) the markings otherwise it is very easy to spill out.\n\nOverall it's a good product if you aren't too picky about how your coffee is ground."

The removable cup, which I thought would be great because I could wash it actually got a ton of soapy water trapped inside of it. Also the whole thing appears to have been opened and repacked before it was shipped out to me.\n\nTruly one star, this thing is cheaply made and got me very angry. I just want to make coffee without having to deal with a loud soapy grinder first thing in the morning. I'm going to keep looking."

Unfortunately they didn't have my particular brand, so I figured I'd give the Hamilton Beach a try. Great price and it's really quiet compared to my old one, and it's a little faster to grind than the old one. BUT, it is a downright shame when a product doesn't last more than a few months with normal standard everyday use. I can't say that we will purchase this product again. We don't have to have the biggest or the best or most expensive, but we want our money to count and the products we buy to last, not just consume and throw away. We're just very disappointed with yet another CHEAP product."

One small twist and the inner cup comes out allowing you to dump your grounded beans into the filter.

Stopping and starting. Tilting. Shaking. Full load. Half load. It NEVER gets all of the beans. There are always a few whole beans left, camouflaged by the rest of the coffee grounds. They are more visible after pouring into my storage container, or after making coffee and looking into the leftover grounds. That equates to wasted money over time, since a whole bean cannot allow water to infuse and extract flavor, forcing you to use more coffee.\n\nBottom line: this product is poorly designed and you should not purchase. Looks good on the shelf though, where it will stay until I take it Goodwill."

The cover and the blades are easy to clean and I sometimes throw them into the dishwasher.

I only use it once every 2-wks to grind 24oz of coffee beans to Turkish grind... that's a powdery grind. It takes about 10-15 min each bag. So, basically, I got 330-min of life from this appliance. At the price I paid for it, which was $10 less than it's currently being sold on Amazon, that means it cost me .81-cents to grind each bag of coffee. That's not great... there's got to be something better.\n\nIf it's an appliance you keep it in the pantry just in case, it will be fine, but get it at a discounted price. It's certainly not worth $28. For me, it wasn't worth $18.\n\n1* out of 5. It will work, it just won't stand up to much use."

I'm not able to achieve a fine, espresso-type powdery result with this machine.\nThe 'bowl' capacity is fairly small. The motor becomes warm after a few uses. I had a 2 pound bag of beans to grind up, and halfway through this unit become sufficiently 'hot' that I unplugged it and let it cool down for 20 minutes before resuming the grinding.\n\nIt's not a bad little basic unit. But I wound up returning it and paying the few extra dollars to buy the KRUPS grinder instead, which I think is a better unit overall.\nThese have tiny little motors that sound like they are really laboring to do the job.\nI am not impressed, honestly, with any of the grinders that are currently available. The KRUPS unit seems like the best of a mediocre lot.\n\nI give this 4 Stars because it does work. I'd give it 5 Stars if it offered a choice of grinds (Coarse/Medium/Fine).\n\nI hope this is helpful as you comparison shop online. Happy brewing, everybody."

The \"tidy\" pull-up mechanism for hiding the cord (really? we need hidden cords?) will drive you nuts if all you want to do is plug the damn thing in and have it go. The good news? It does grind coffee beans. On the other hand, based on how the motor sounds, I'm betting this one won't last nearly as long as our old grinder. Save yourself some money and look elsewhere."

When that gave out I wanted a grinder that was\n\n- compact,\n- inexpensive\n- easy to use and clean\n- grinds coffee, spices and nuts.\n\nThe REMOVABLE GRINDING CUP makes it easy to scoop in the coffee beans or spices instead of pouring it in and getting stuff all over the counter. It also makes it easy to pour into the contents into another container without having to pick up the whole unit. AND this removable grinding cup it makes it easy to clean between using it for spices or coffee.\n\nThe cord can be lengthened or shortened and stored in the bottom that twists down and then back up. This way when using you keep the cord at the length you want and when storing don't have to wrap the cord around the body of the appliance.\n\nWe love it - it is compact, quiet and easy to use and clean.\n\nHIGHLY RECOMMEND!"

I love the removable chamber, this feature makes it SO easy to pour the grinds out (especially early, when coffee is needed most) and makes cleanup quick and painless.\n\nWhat it doesn't tell you here is that the power cord wraps around the bottom in a hidden storage compartment. That little gray plastic area at the base? With a gentle pull it slides down, exposing the power cord. It's not outrageously long our inconveniently short, and the plug just sticks out the back, not too loose, not too tight. Very good for storing without a big cord mess in the cupboard, or having to try to wrap it awkwardly around the outside. Also great for portability.\n\nWhen this one finally does give out, I'll definitely buy the same model to replace it."

I bought the Hamilton Beach because the price was reasonable, and had previous good experience with the brand. I liked that the grinding bowl could be taken out to clean it. However, the way it grinds the beans is no good. Either they are overground, and the coffee is too strong, or they leave whole beans after grinding. There seems to be no in-between. With the old one, even though there wasn't a setting for the strength of the coffee, I knew when it made a certain sound, it was finished, and completely ground. With this, it might make a similar sound, but it is not done. I am very unhappy with the purchase, and looking to buy something else."

Elsewhere here I read how you can remove the bottom cover triangular slot out with a small flat screwdriver, and that the switch gets blocked with debris. However, with mine, a wire inside was broke. By testing the wire continuity with a voltmeter, I found that there is a little fuse-like attachment in one of the wire that was broken. A quick solder job and the thing is working again. Inside the motor looks very good in quality and was practically new. Why throw it away in a land fill when you can fix it. Was it designed to blow that fuse after a period of time? I never saw a fuse like that before on an appliance motor, pre-China -- those motors lasted a decade until the brushes wore away."

I got mine as a gift 2 xmas's ago. Still going strong and absolutely no issues. Would I buy another one if this one puked out on me? Oh H*** yea. Only thing I will say when you are done grinding your beans before you take the top off take the heal of your hand and tap the side of it before you take the top off. Otherwise you will get coffee all over your counter. But I think all the grinders are like this. On an ending note here; QUIT YOUR WHINING!!"

            "reviewText": "Really Good Coffee is a big part of my daily life. I love coffee.\n\nI bought one of these Hamilton Beach HB Coffee Grinders in black because it was available, not because I had planned to do so. It was an impulse buy at the time.\n\nWe needed to buy a grinder after we left a house-share situation with a very sophisticated grinder that we had grown accustomed to using. Due to extensive travel over the last few years, our regular coffee and kitchen equipment is in storage over 1000 miles from our current location.\n\nWe purchased this Hamilton Beach grinder about 6 or 7 months ago and we paid about $14.95 plus tax.\n\nAt the time of purchase, we figured if it lasted a few months we would be satisfied and we would have received our money's worth. It's now ~7 months later, and we use this grinder everyday for grinding whole bean coffee for \"one-off\" cups which we brew utilizing a \"Melita style\" drip system. We have chosen this brewing format because it is a portable system and it packs well in our suitcases.\n\nWe travel now with this kit in our suitcases:\n\nMelita style drip plastic cone (paper filter holder)\nMelita style paper filters (#2)\nHamilton Beach HB Coffee Grinder Black\nWhole Bean Coffee of choice (French Roast Blend)\n\nIf we are limited on baggage capacity we can buy coffee at the destination although sometimes we have found it difficult to locate good coffee upon arrival - depending on the location - so we have learned to always travel with enough whole bean coffee to get us by for a week or so.\n\nThus we are able maintain a level of quality in the coffee we drink regardless of location, whether we are staying in hotel, a friend's house, or in a foreign country. We did recently travel to Costa Rica for 3 months and made the mistake of not taking paper cone filters with us or the Melita cone and were unable to find either anywhere to buy.\n\nWe did, however, take our Hamilton Beach grinder with us.\n\nSERVICE LEVEL:\n\nWe do not use this grinder a great deal. It's usually for enough whole bean coffee to make 6-8 cups a day so that each cup is freshly ground and brewed from scratch every time.\n\nOccasionally, I use the grinder to grind up nuts or herbs/breadcrumbs/seasoning combinations for breading meats when cooking. But the vast majority is for whole bean coffee only. And I prefer not to infuse the seasonings flavor into the coffee. But it does work pretty well for that application and if I were going to do that frequently, I would buy another grinder dedicated to that application only.\n\nFEATURE:\n\nOne of the coolest features of the grinder is \"removable grinder chamber\" that makes it very convenient for dispensing the ground beans when I finish grinding them. I simply remove the chamber and take it to the location of the cup and Melita cone and it minimizes the mess and the cleanup. I like this design feature very much.\n\nConclusion: Strongly Recommend\n\nThis is not a heavy duty piece of equipment. Yet is is an example of good engineering and design. It is practical, functional and quite inexpensive. I am very satisfied with the Hamilton Beach and recommend it highly for the application described.\n\nJust as a note, I used to own an espresso shop and I still have a commercial espresso machine and a Mazzer burr grinder (that I love) but currently they are in storage.\n\nRegards from sunny Florida..."

They want you to pay for shipping, both directions for warranty replacement.\nThe coffee grinder was rarely used, I bet less than 25 times and it just quit working. Of course the plastic body is sealed so you cannot inspect or attempt to repair. It just goes in the garbage.\nThe steam iron was worse. It over heated. Getting so hot is scorched the ironing board cover as soon as it touch. I had to unplug the power button would not respond. When turned back on, it now leaks although I tossed it after the overheating. HB warranty department said to cut off the cord, send them a picture and they would replace with the same or similar piece of junk."

Small pieces of that can be wound onto a hook to make the body of a fly.\nThe machine worked pretty well for a while, but now it has loosened up a bunch, and sometimes the blades won't spin at all. I have found very small bits of plastic in the cup too. I think it's about toast. It's a mystery to me how such an absolute POS can generate a 4 star rating on Amazon. What corporate strategy says it's a good idea to manufacture a product guaranteed to fail within a year? Why aren't they recalling the product? Have they no pride in their company at all?
