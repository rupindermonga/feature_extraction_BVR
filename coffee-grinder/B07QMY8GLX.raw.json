            "reviewDate": "June 24, 2019",
            "reviewText": "I used a Breville for over a year and loved it, until it started jamming a lot, and I thought I needed an upgrade. I did a lot of research and found everyone saying this was the grinder to get, and it's about $100 more than the Breville, so I went with it.\n\nGrinder came in, I made a few cups at recommended settings + a little tweaking. Could never get any good flavor out of it. I used a Kruve sieve, and it confirmed what I tasted: the grinder was only giving me like 33% fines, 33% good range (400-800 microns), 33% boulder, distribution. In other words, it is literally all over the place, no consistency in distribution. My cheaper Breville gave me 12%, 75%, 12%. I have NO idea why this grinder is recommended by so many?? It's either not a good grinder, or there was a problem with the model they sent me.\n\nI requested a refund and they only sent me 50% of my money, which was extra disappointing. To be fair, my gf had already thrown out the product box (and I think I forgot to send in the brush which I recently found), but still, $125 for restocking, brush, and box? Come on.\n\nI held a grudge against the company, but eventually gave in and ordered a Forte anyway. That was quite the upgrade. Now I'm getting 90% in the desirable range.\n\nDon't spend your money on this and get a Breville if you're in this kind of price range."

Very clearly worth the price, and able to be repaired and renewed at a very modest cost. My last grinder!"

            "reviewText": "I bought this to replace another coffee grinder, and even though both are conical burr grinders, this one makes better tasting coffee. There is a very precise timer, so that you can make exactly the amount of coffee you want consistently, with nothing left over. That means that all the coffee is brewed from freshly-ground beans. It's pretty loud but most grinders are. Some assembly is required, and instructions are not great (who knew that they hid the gasket in the bin for ground coffee?); that is the only reason I did not give it 5 stars."

            "reviewText": "I'm very happy with the quality and consistency of the grind this machine produces. Most beans produce little or no static buildup. The grind timer has to be adjusted every time I try a new blend, since beans differ in weight by variety and I always use ground coffee by weight. The machine does remember its last setting. The hopper capacity is not more than 1/2 lb or so, so I continue to use an airtight canister as storage. Since I got this machine grinding coffee every morning no longer wakes my husband. ;-)\n\nThe machine is much more expensive than any other coffee grinder I've had, but having taken the plunge, I'm glad that I did. This is a very good piece of equipment, very solid and easy to clean, etc. Highly recommended!"

Twice beans have jammed between the burr and grinder wall and the setting got moved from mine of 18 all the way to zero ruining a complete hopper of beans. I wasn't, and don't want to have to be, standing next to the unit watching its every move. Have to use a small fork to pry out the jammed beans resulting is a real mess on the counter. This grinder is slow (knew this from reviews) but is also at least as noisy as than my old Capresso 560 grinder which I had for 6 years. Ease of cleaning is not much better than my Capresso, which always seems to be a major hit on the Capresso.. Going back to the Capresso. Not sure who to foist this Baratza on!"

Baratza makes quality, user friendly products. As for the noise factor, I've nothing to compare it with but consider it reasonable. Performance-wise, I'd say I got my money's worth.

Bottom line is there can be anywhere from a 2 to 6 gram variance using same beans, same grind time and setting.\n\nFor example filling the hopper with beans and selecting an 18 grind setting for a time of 18 seconds results in about 20 grams of ground coffee. Press the button again with exact same settings and 26 grams of ground coffee comes out, press it again and you get 24 grams of ground coffee.\n\nIf you\u2019re more of a ballpark scoop sort of coffee brewer then the Virtuoso+ is likely a great machine for you. But if you\u2019re expecting the timer to produce precise, consistent and repeatable amounts of ground coffee then you will like me be disappointed. I verified this with Baratza who confirmed due to size, shape and position of beans in the hopper the margin of error I was experiencing is to be expected.\n\nNote I purchased this coffee grinder from a west coast online retailer who has been less than helpful in answering my questions, and I doubt they are going to publish my honest review, so that\u2019s why I am posting it here on Amazon."

I have had my unit over 4 years and has always performed well. Today I got up started grinding my daily pot and noticed it slowing down. It was done would not work anymore. I was about ready to just pitch it and realize I had spent $250 on something that did not last. WRONG!!! ...I stumbled on the company's phone number in WA but did not expect much WRONG AGAIN. After talking to a very nice rep going through troubleshooting figured out motor died. We split shipping costs they are repairing for a FAIR fee and shipping it back. Not often you get this kind of service or a REAL person on the phone to talk to you. I am super happy and will never buy another grinder from anyone but them! 100% satisfied with the grinder and the U.S. company that makes it. Dont believe the negatives they stand by their grinders."

Everything I HATED about the gen 1 has been fixed in the Virtuoso+!\n\n1) Wind up timer yielding imprecise grind sessions...gone. V+ now has a digital timer easily adjusted to dial in precise and repeatable grinds.\n\n2) The dark smokey grounds bin hiding what you grind...gone. V+ now has an integrated light that illuminates the grinds bin.\n\nVirtuoso was already a great burr grinder with a strong motor and wide range of grind options. None of that has changed. If you have a gen 1 unit and are looking for an improvement or are a new buyer looking for a very good grinder... this is it!"

            "reviewText": "My Bodum Bistro Burr grinder gave up the ghost after five years of every-other-day use. (The motor still works, but obviously a plastic gear or other internal part broke.) When I saw how highly rated the previous-version Virtuoso was and that Baratza sells replacement parts, I decided on this model. (The idea of selling product that's destined for the landfill after three or four years drives me nuts.)\n\nSo far I'm very happy with the performance of this grinder. It's quieter than Bodum it replaced (but by no means quiet). The plastic bin is a bit of a downgrade from the glass of the Bodum, but it holds much more coffee and will run *much longer* due to the higher-quality parts. I grind Hazelnut beans -- a little, but not too oily -- at 17 for drip coffee using brown paper filters, and the resulting rounds are consistent in size and perfect for my use. I hope to get MANY years out of this grinder, and will report back if anything goes awry. (Hopefully I'll have a positive update in a year's time.)"

But as for the main function of grinding coffee for espresso, Aeropress, and drip coffee; both the Encore and Virtuoso+ are outstanding with consistent grind size."

Since I'm considering an espresso maker, I wanted a grinder that would grind fine enough for espresso. I haven't made espresso yet, but I did test the unit on the \"Fine\" setting & it did seem to be fine enough for espresso - almost a powder. The Baratza grinders have high ratings on cooking shows.\nThe Virtuoso \"Plus\" has a couple of features that I really like, such as the LED light that lets you see the fill level in the grounds bin and the digital readout on the front display.\nBaratza did an excellent job of solving the static problem with coffee grinders. I don't know how they did it, but there is NO spraying out of coffee grounds after grinding, like there was with my Cuisinart grinder. Also, there is no lid on the grounds bin, which allows you to grind directly into your pour over or espresso filter."

I ordered a new one and the cone burr but looking closer it is ok and I could have got away with th ering burr for about $14.00 plus shipping. Actually this was probably a good thing as we grind daily, not a lot, but some and using french press, I noticed it was passing more fines than I wanted. It looks like the burr had been going three years before the damage. I got the Capresso out and it seemed to do a good job with a coarse grind as well. I will install then new burr and track usage but I think we use about a pound a week."
