            "reviewText": "When it works it's great, BUT:\n\nBreville uses a cheap plastic impeller that wears down. The impeller is what pushes the coffee out after it's been ground. If the impeller doesn't work, the coffee beans aren't able to flow down into the burr. Apparently this goes back several years. I bought mine in Dec, 2015. This issue has begun to pop-up on the BCG820, but it's been happening on other models as well, like the BCG400SIL, BCG600SIL, and BCG800XL. The BCG820 has a metal \u201carmor\u201d that just clads the impeller, but underneath it is just a plastic part similar to the other models. This metal piece doesn't really do anything other than make it \"look\" like it's metal when you simply glance at it from the top with the burrs on. The issue doesn't start happening until after it's out of warranty. Mine started happening about 6-7 months after the warranty period had ended. Breville doesn't sell the part on its website to be replaced.\n\nGoogle \"Hidden defect in Breville coffee grinders\" for details on the issue. There's a guy that sells a 3d-printed impeller for the BCG800, which can be found by searching \"BCG800XL Grinder Jamming due to Worn Impeller\""

            "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars",
            "reviewTitle": "Important to know - disregard some bad reviews",
            "reviewDate": "May 28, 2019",
            "reviewText": "There are many bad reviews here about this grinder seizing or stopping, and a few even that talk of a burning smell... this is an easy problem to get around.\n\nBottom line, this is a truly superb entry level grinder with one major drawback that is easily overcome. I'll get into what makes this grinder great in a bit, but first, the one thing you NEED TO KNOW if you buy this model.\n\nIf the grinder slows down or stops grinding before it has run its cycle, PAUSE THE GRINDER. You do this by pressing the button on the right. Then remove the hopper (consult the manual - this is easy to do). Remove the upper burr (also easy to do - read the manual). Dump out any beans inside the grinder (just pick the machine up and turn it upside down - I dump the beans back into the hopper). Brush out the lower burr area (Breville supplies a small brush for this). Put the upper burr and the hopper back together. Restart the grinder (press the right button). It will complete the remainder of the cycle that was paused. You may wish to manually grind a bit more to make up for any lost grounds.\n\nWhy does this happen? The motor in this model is a bit underpowered. It can get hung up while grinding. It is rare, but there it is. It's happened to me once in months of daily use. When it happens, follow the steps above and you should have no issues. It's what I did, and the grinder went right back to flawless operation like it had never happened.\n\nWhy is this still a great grinder? It's pretty simple - the ONLY thing that matters about a grinder other than reliability/durability is how consistent the grind is (how uniform is the size of the individual specks of ground coffee). The better the consistency, the better your coffee will be, period.\n\nThis model **absolutely excels** in consistency. Hands down, independently tested, it blows every grinder in this price range out of the water with more than twice as much \"optimal\" size grounds as compared to the next best make and model. You can spend 2 or 3 times this amount and still not get a more consistent grind than you will with this guy. Where it counts, this grinder is the king, unless you want to spend far far more for a true professional model.\n\nSome additional nice features:\n---With a bit of experimenting, you can dial in exactly how much coffee you want it to grind per cup (for drip) or per shot (for espresso) and easily program that amount in so you don't have to think about it again. Once that is done, you can simply tell it 1 or 2 shots, or how many drip cups (up to 12) that you want to make, and then you can ALWAYS grind the EXACT amount of coffee you need. This means you can always make coffee with only freshly ground beans without ever wasting a single bean. That is pretty awesome.\n---You can experiment with up to 60 grind sizes to dial in exactly what you want. Personally, for espresso, 15.8 seconds at size 14 grind gives a perfectly dialed in double shot on my Breville espresso machine. For drip, I'm liking the mid 40's, but I haven't decided exactly where yet. The difference from one setting to the adjacent setting is really hard to taste with drip coffee.\n---If you don't need super fine espresso grinds but want courser grounds than setting 60 will give you (to get French Press just so), you can adjust the upper burr (easy to do - read the manual). There are 4 more positions that will adjust all 60 settings and make them coarser. Conversely, if you want even finer espresso but don't need the coarsest settings, there are 5 more positions of that upper burr that will make the whole range of the machine finer. One video review I saw said this makes for 600 grind settings, but I'm sure most of those 600 are overlapping. It's at least 69 different grinds possible, at any rate.\n---Large hopper. Not as big as a professional grinder's hopper, but you can put a full pound of beans into this grinder with some room to spare.\n---Cleanly removable hopper. In order to remove the hopper, you twist a knob to \"lock\" it. This closes down the feed ports at the bottom so no beans will fall out when you take the hopper off. If you want to get crazy, you could buy a second hopper (or more) and switch between espresso and normal coffee easily (although the first few beans ground will be from the previous hopper, left behind in the burr, unless you dump them out when switching). The removable hopper also makes it very easy to clean after it starts to get oil buildup (which can contribute to the machine seizing up).\n---Magnetic removable catch tray. Grinds get everywhere, and this makes cleaning up of (most) loose grinds very easy.\n---Magnetic portafilter holders. You get two, one for the standard 58mm PF size, and one for the smaller PF's found on Breville automatic espresso machines. You can set your portafilter in the holder, and grind right into it without any mess. There's even a button so you can set the portafilter in, then activate the grinder by simply pushing on the portafilter.\n\nSome things that could stand improvement:\n---More powerful motor... that would make this grinder just about perfect.\n---Could be a bit quieter. It's not especially loud, as grinders go, but it's not the quietest I've owned either. But a more power motor would probably be louder, so they may have been trying to find a balance here between powerful and quiet.\n---The included catch \"cup\". It seals airtight, which is nice, but the mouth does not line up with the grinder port when it's inserted fully. Push it too far back in and the metal lid sticks to the magnet designed to secure the portafilter adapter, but if you line it up just right with the grinder port, the vibration of the grinder tends to make it to slide out of place during grinding. The fix is to just grind directly into your filter, or take the lid off the \"cup\" and set it all the way in to catch your grounds.\n\nOVERALL RECOMMENDATION:\n---If you mainly make drip or pour-over coffee, and/or espresso, this grinder is unbeatable unless you can afford a true professional model. Stay vigilant if it binds up (again, that's rare but potentially damaging for the motor). But if you take good care of this grinder, and spend some time customizing the settings, it will deliver superior grinds in exactly the amounts you need, every time.\n---If you primarily make Press coffee, and really like extremely coarse grinds, then there is probably a better choice for you out there."

            "reviewText": "My grind and brew coffee maker bit the dust, so I needed a replacement. I drink exclusively fresh roasted beans from a quality roaster, so I decided to upgrade to a high quality coffee maker and separate burr grinder. I already have a semi-auto espresso maker, so the grinder is for drip coffee and the occasional French press or pour over. After research and sorting through the reviews on Amazon, I settled on the Breville. I like the features, and as a bonus, it came in red. Please check out some other reviews if you want to learn more about how it operates, as I did not have the grinder long enough to give it a fair evaluation on that.\n\nAfter I received the first grinder, I successfully had a lovely pot of coffee. Between the grind and brew and this new grinder, I was using a whirly blade grinder. What a difference. A burr grinder really is needed to get the most out of the beans. I was pleased. Then day two to make coffee. FAIL. The grinder simply would not work. For reference, the beans were a lighter roast (City), so it was not an issue with oil buildup. I followed some trouble shooting. It just would not work again. Amazon is amazing and sent a replacement out immediately.\n\nGrinder 2. This time I got 3 grinds out of it before the grinder stopped. I followed trouble shooting, and ultimately I think it's a gear made of plastic that just keeps slipping. There is a built in protection that stops the grinder if it has too much torque - such as a rock entering the grinder. This keeps the motor from burning out. But there were no rocks, just light roasted coffee beans. Maybe it was a batch the slipped through quality control; maybe the issue is more common among the ones cased in red. But at this price point, that really should not happen. So back it went. After two failures, I was done with giving the Breville a chance. I purchased a Baratza and moved on. I am pleased with the Baratza - it works like it should."

            "reviewText": "So far so good. I read more reviews than probably anyone ever should BUT, I kept coming back to the breville because of the ease in switching between drip and espresso. I don't have experience in espresso and didn't what to spend a ton of money on things for it(grinder and machine) if i wasn't sure I would drink it like that (and i dont.i prefer moka right now). THIS , was a good decision.\n\nIt was \"cheap\", the grinders are uniform and its quiet. Its a big step up from my hand grinder where you have to guess if the setting is right. And, with the taste difference, even with drip, im assuming the consistency with the hand grinder wasn't the best.\n\nThe machine fills my portafilter without a problem. I read about other machines throwing grinds all over the place. And for drip, the included cup is perfect. NO static or anything like that. I just need to get use to the timer feature.\n\nI clean my grinder daily, as of right now i use it twice a day. Usually going from drip to moka pot grind (which is almost the same). And it needs it. there is a lot of left over grinds caught in there. which brings me to my next point\n\nI think a lot of the problems people have is from not cleaning the machine. If you try to go a wk( and im sure some people push it farther than that) without cleaning it you are going to have problems!!! The more coffe in their, the harder the motor has to work\n\nMy grind settings: for drip i use, 32 (which is the start of drip on the screen). for moka,30 (this is near perfect) and for my pressurized filter i use 25 for really fresh beans and then go down 1 notch every wk.\n\nAlso with mine i notice for little clumping. Very very little.. If it lasts two years using it the way i do... it would be a steal in my eye"

Then progressing to espresso and getting an espresso maker.....before quickly realizing my $20 Mr. Coffee grinder wasn't going to cut it and that the grind is incredibly key. Enter: this Breville burr grinder. DANG. It made a profound difference -- being able to dial in the grind specific to whatever device you're using to brew was a super game changer. So much so that we ordered two more. Proper coffee degenerates here. Love this grinder though -- I haven't ever had to clean it or had it jam like other reviewers have mentioned. The electronic display screen is super handy and the hopper is a great size -- fits an entire 14 ounce canister of fresh beans."

It doesn't generate an excessive amount of static and spew grounds all over our counter top even when using a stainless steel coffee cup for the grounds receptacle. The grounds are uniform and once you adjust it to your preferences you push one button and it does the job. Its pretty quiet as these things go and many of them are as loud as a tornado siren.

            "reviewText": "Our 12-year-old Rancillio Rocky grinder's motor stopped working. I'm sure it could be repaired. The heavy duty brass burrs are still in fine shape, but we decided to give something new a try. The Rocky has been a solid grinder, but not very neat (grounds would get all over the counter) or convenient since one must stand there and hold the button down until you have enough grounds. We grind for espresso (non-pressurized portafilter), drip (currently the OXO ON1 Barista Brain... which is fantastic), and I also grind for the Aeropress I use at the office. The Smart Grinder Pro was the best value we found in a grinder that can go fine enough for nonpressurized espresso portafilters, and also has features like automatic timer grind, portafilter holder, pause grind, and easy cleaning.\n\nWe have had the Smart Grinder Pro for only one week, but it has already had a big improvement on our morning coffee routine. The ability to select the number of cups, hit Start, and have it automatically grind the beans while you fill up the coffee maker with water is a huge convenience. It's also pretty quiet. A bit more quiet than our Rocky, and much quieter than a whirlyblade grinder or a disc grinder. The conical burrs grind consistently for drip and espresso. I'm sure our old Rocky is probably a bit more consistent for coarse French press grounds, but we don't use a French press these days. I adjusted the burr settings towards the finer end of things, and I'm able to get a grind that is fine enough and consistent enough for our nonpressurized espresso portafilter.\n\nThis grinder does not have an integrated scale, but the automatic timer is well calibrated to grind the correct amount of beans per golden ratio cup or per espresso shot. You can adjust the timer for more or less as well. The only thing you have to watch for is if beans get stuck in the hopper while the timer is ticking. It has only happened to me once this week, but I could hear the grinder spinning with nothing in it. A tap on the side of the bean hopper got things flowing again, but I had to carefully measure out the coffee since I knew the timer was running for a few seconds with nothing to grind.\n\nIt shipped with two portafilter holders. The smaller one fits ours. The magnetic snap in feature is fantastic. It's so easy to switch between portafilter and drop container. The bottom tray also comes out easily for cleaning and then snaps back in with a magnet.\n\nMy only complaint about the grinder is that the container for catching grounds doesn't catch them as well as it could. If you use the lid, which has a hole for the grounds, some grounds always spill down the side. Not many, but a few. I've been grinding without the lid and that works fine. Another reviewer recommended a glass beaker that fits under the grinder perfectly. I may give that a try. It might not be necessary. The included container works with no mess so far, but it's plastic so static make the grounds cling to the side a little.\n\nOverall we are very happy and I would give it 4.5 stars if that were an option. Only complaint is the design of the grind container lid, which many may not even use. If you have a flat bottom filter, you can just grind into that. Only time will tell if it lasts 12 years like our Rocky did, but so far we like it more. It's easier to use, looks easier to clean, keeps our counter totally clean, and makes great tasting coffee at all the grinds we need."

Purchased it anyway because of the price, versatility, and that it matches my Breville Infuser espresso machine. It does look like they have made improvements on the impeller. It's not completely metal but the plastic impeller blades are now almost completely covered by a metal shield. Only time will tell if this is a solution to the premature impeller wear problem.\nIt does have a consistent grind for the most part but does sound like its struggling when grinding espresso down in the less than 10 range. As others have stated I do hear a faint whine when the unit is off and plugged in. Not sure if this is a hazard so I just unplug it after use.\nAll in all its a decent grinder packed with tons of features for decent price. If you do a lot of daily grinding a heavier duty machine may be a better choice long term."

The plastic maintains a static charge and the coffee grounds that don't go into your container stick all over the inside and outside of this machine. I've tried every type of anti static wipe I can think of and nothing works so be willing to accept that fact. You'll need to wipe your counter up after each use since there will be some grounds that just seem to go where they want instead on into your container - not a big deal for us since we are always wiping down the food prep surfaces after each little thing is done, just warning you folks that think this is not gonna leave a small mess. Here's another thing that disappoints me: I have been trying to purchase extra Grinds Containers. There are three parts. The plastic container, the rubber seal, and the stainless screw on lid. GOOD LUCK trying to purchase all three at the same time. I've been trying to buy the lid for several weeks and it's not listed as able to order. You can't pre-order one. Call the 800 number for support and the computer just boots you out of the system. Chat has not been on line for weeks either. It's obvious they don't give a Rats A$$ about customer service. Based on that I'd say buy another manufacturers brand because if you have a problem you're probably gonna get Pulp Fictioned! So sad because I thought they were a good company. With that said I have mine and if it is ever in need of service I'll just pitch it."

            "reviewText": "I bought the Smart Grinder Pro because it listed a couple of features I wanted: a portafilter holder to allow grinding directly into a portafilter and a timed grind. Despite having expectations I was surprised by just how well they work and how well they are complemented by other features of the grinder.\n\nThe hopper holds a full pound, so there's no more messing around with resealed half-bags. The hopper lid has a gasket to seal tightly and minimize oxidation. When unlocked, the hopper closes off the bean chute, so you can lift it out and clean the burrs without requiring more or less elaborate measures to avoid spilling beans.\n\nThe timed grind gets it just right, allowing enough adjustment to get you the grind you want, without allowing so much adjustment that you have to spend days experimenting to find the right settings. In addition, once you've found your settings, they're programmable.\n\nI was prepared to find grinding into the portafilter a bit messy, particularly because I use a non-standard Saeco portafilter, but that's not the case here at all. The portafilter fits into the holder and grinder very well and grinding into it is extremely tidy. Even if you do manage to spill a few grounds, there's a lift out inner base that allows easy cleanup. Overall it's the least messy grinder I've ever seen or heard of.\n\nBest of all, the grind is superb and has made a notable improvement in my brew. I've only rarely made or had espresso this good.\n\nGiven the other reviews here on Amazon and the generally light heft of the machine in comparison to the Baratza I had been using, I do have some concerns about durability. The portafilter holder in particular is made of plastic that has to flex slightly every time a portafilter is inserted or withdrawn. I'll be surprised if that isn't the first thing to break. I'll revisit this review in that light if necessary, but in the meantime I'm really glad to have stumbled across this grinder"

However, after two months of daily use, the lower burr disconnected from the grinder and there is no \"easy fix.\" Re-attaching the lower burr requires disassembling practically the entire machine, and the gear box must be reassembled with six ball bearings and six springs (not a simple task, made more difficult without the build manual from Breville, which I'm sure they don't provide because of propriety reasons). After disassembling and reassembling twice, I finally got it working for a brief period of time (about 1/2lb of coffee ground), at which point the lower burr disconnected again. I really liked the grinder, but sadly, I cannot recommend it to fellow coffee aficionados. Best of luck finding another grinder."

If you do mostly espresso, drip, or pour overs using paper filters, then you'll be fine. I also have to strategically time when I use the grinder or cover it with lots of dish towels to muffle the sound when family members are asleep. I realize that probably all coffee grinders will be loud, so this is just an fyi.\n\nAlso, know that there is no 'off' button for the display as far as I can tell. You have to let it time out. If you hit the on/grind button again, you'll just grind more coffee. Not a problem, just something to get used to.

Be sure to look at the water container and it tells you not to make more than 8 cups with a cone filter. I made 12 cups with a cone filter and it filled it to the top and had some grinds in the pot. This is not the fault of the coffee make; it was my fault for not looking at the markings on the water container. I used the same coffee beans that I was using in my Cuisinart. My first sip sold me!! What a difference. I'm not sure why it's so much better but it is. Taste like Starbucks, if not better. If anyone wants a GREAT tasting cup of coffee at home or in the office, I don't think you can go wrong with this combo.\n\nUpdate. I made one pot of coffee and then when I tried to make another one this morning I ran into a problem Maybe it''s me. I filled to tank up with 8 cups of water, put the ground coffee in the filter and put the caraft in place. I thought I would do that the night before. This morning I pressed the start button and nothing happened. It would just not turn on. I did not have the auto start turned on. I unplugged it and plugged it back in. It ask me to fill the tank which was already filled. I exempted it out and put in fresh water. It then ask me to select a filter which I done the night before. Then it ask me to put the carafe in but it already was in. Finally I pressed the start button and it made a pot of coffee. Am I doing something srong?"

The first was a Krups that used a volumetric dosing. It was made of plastic, built up static and made for messy grinding and imprecise doses. I stopped drinking expresso after I got fed up with the Krups and switched to the Bodum Bistro which served me well, but was lousy for espresso grinds. The hopper was also too small because I roast a full pound in my Behmor 1600 and like putting the whole drum into hopper. The Breville has a one pound hopper which is removable. The grind seems uniform and it's easy to use. I don't use the plastic vessel they provide because I either grind straight into a portafilter or into a glass tumbler because static is less of an issue. Don't see why Breville included a sealable container for ground coffee when any rational coffee lover would NEVER use ground coffee that had sat in a container (sealed or otherwise). I considered the Baratza Encore and Virtuoso. This seems to sit somewhere in between, although I like Breville's look more. I calibrate the timed dosing with a small scale I bought from Harbor Freight. While I realize different coffee varietals and roast would change, the variation does not bother me. I get wonderful Espresso and Vacuum Pot coffee from this machine."

            "reviewText": "My husband and I were looking for a good grinder that could do both espresso and french press for under 200 bucks. We first tried the Rok coffee grinder. Bad idea, messy, intrinsically defective, major design flaws, sprayed out grounds in a cone shape with the open end pointed down (messy as f***), just all around a bad idea. The Smart Grinder Pro was our second attempt at getting a good grinder in this price range. So how did it work out?\n\nOverall, the smart grinder pro is the best bang for the buck.\n-I love the digital readout for the grind, it makes it very easy to reproduce previous good grinds.\n-The timing function is super useful for handling dispensing the grounds.\n-The anti-static chamber is excellent, I have noticed no static cling issues whatsoever with this grinder.\n-The portafilter fittings are also a nice touch and make it very easy to grind straight into the portafilter for my Gaggia classic. Easily cuts 3 minutes off of the time it takes to make my espresso.\n-The hopper design is nice as well, its airtight and fits more than enough beans. The grind quality is consistent, I usually grind at around a 9 on the main grind settings with 6 on the macro adjustment on the burr itself (this is the default setting). I love being able to pull the hopper off of the grinder and change out or refrigerate the beans.\n- Supposedly Breville is great when it comes to replacement parts availability.\n\nNow for the flaws or I should say annoyances. Most of these aren't too bad but I'll mention them in the interest of full disclosure.\n-This unit is slower than the Baratza Sette 270. The Sette gets your espresso in the portafilter in ~4 seconds, this machine takes ~17.5 seconds.\n-Another issue is that although there is a pause functionality on the grinder, it isn't really useful because the damn thing resets the timer after about 10-15 seconds. This is annoying if you're grinding and then redistributing the grounds in a portafilter. Not the worst thing in the world but it's something that should (and definitely can) be fixed by the manufacturer with just a simple software tweak so that the timer at least takes one or two minutes before resetting. Still, you can just hit the start button again until there's enough coffee there for your liking. If you do drip coffee, you won't even notice it.\n- Not the end of the world but a lot of the \"metal\" is just plating. It still feels sturdy and doesn't hurt the functionality (or bargain) of the machine but again, full disclosure. I knew this going in and it hasn't been an issue.\n- For espresso, you don't have a *huge* amount of room to work with as far as grinds but I've found that I have enough. I started with overly fine grinds and was able to dial in fairly quickly. For some machines that need finer grinds, it may be an issue. Like I said, with the gaggia classic, I haven't had issues.\n- I haven't tried this myself but supposedly this machine suffers in the course grind range (french press) but is more than adequate for french roast.\n-Having lived in apartments with two prong outlets, I'll mention that this device has a three pronged plug. Not a problem for most people but just something to be aware of.\n\nAll in all, a great grinder, good choice for espresso. Would buy again."

There's actually a guy who's posted a video that explains the problem and shows step-by-step how to fix it. (Look for \"breville smart grinder pro jamming problem\" on YouTube.) But the fix requires disassembling the entire unit. As for the part, Breville apparently doesn't sell spare parts, so this guy has designed a 3D printed replacement part that may be better than the original, and you have to order it for about $25 from a site called shapeways.com. Sooo...if you're handy, if you have the right tools and if you don't mind having to disassemble your grinder periodically, this is a really great coffee grinder. Otherwise, I guess you can send the grinder in to Breville every year or so and pay about $100 every time to have them fix it.

I think it's setup by default for espresso users, so they can't be faulted for setting the default range a little fine.\nThe grind is uniform, and moderately quick (not too fast to get hot!) and the coffee is excellent!

Most of the complaints I see about the Smart Grinder pro is the impeller failing after 6 months to a year and complaints about the grind being extremely fine even on the coarsest settings. But I haven't seen reports of the failure my machine experienced.\n\nMost people researching the Smart Grinder Pro as a possible purchase (And you should before you buy any product) understand how to set the functions of the machine. After following the instructions out of the box, i insured the burr was fully seated and snapped into place. Then the same with the bean hopper, fully seated and snapped into place. Then I put a few beans in the hopper for a test grind. The little cursor that marks the grind setting immediately began running back and forth up and down the scale. This action caused a constant change in grind time. Fearing I had failed to set the removable burr fully in place, I stopped it, cleaned the machine completely and started over. Same result, as soon as I turn the machine on to grind, the the grind setting cursor runs wild up and down the scale. Two more attempts to get it right and I decide the electronics came busted on this machine, whether a loose wire somewhere or a bad circuit board in the control panel.\n\nI started the process of returning the grinder and am sent to Amazon Tech Support, where I explain to a very nice person (Arlene) my problem with the machine. After talking her through exactly what happened, this nice person set up a replacement to be sent. I give Amazon and the nice Arlene 5+ stars for being so courteous and helpful. I hope the electronics failure of my first Breville Smart Grinder Pro is not a common problem.\n\nI will update this review after I receive the replacement grinder and test it out for a while.\n\n4/4/19 update: The replacement arrived promptly and thus far works as advertised. Still working through the grind settings, but that is an operator issue. Hopefully The Smart Grinder pro will have a healthy life span. 4 star for prompt replacement by amazon and a working grinder. Now to see how well it performs."

After some research I could only find three below $250 that can do this. This one, for $180, and the Baratza Virtuoso, for $140 and the Compresso Infinity. Reading the reviews for the Baratza it appears that you first have to get instructions from the internet on how to adjust the shims on the burrs to get very fine, (what the \u2026?) This alone is worth the extra $40 for this one.\n\nAfter opening the box I was impressed with the build quality and attractive appearance. It produces consistent and even grinds, that alone is worth the $180. There are 3 features that surprised me. The first being the LCD panel, I figured this was unnecessary and perhaps cheesy, well it works great and is very useful. The second is the grind time control. I was thinking this would be a poor substitute for a built-in scale, but that is not the case. I sometimes keep it simple and make my espresso with a pressurized filter, and since grind fineness is not so critical, I use grind size setting 15, it just so happens that this size happens to grind my medium roast beans at 1 gram per second (I have a digital kitchen scale to establish this) so to make pressurized espresso I set the grind to 15 and the timer to 14 seconds and I consistently get 14 grams of perfectly ground beans! I am still playing with what grind works best for non-pressurized so I haven\u2019t yet established what time I will need to get my 18 grams. Bottom-line, the timer is a perfectly adequate substitute for a built-in scale. The third feature is the option to dispense grinds directly into your portafilter. I figured this would be useless as it would be messy and with all the grinds left on the counter I would end up with fewer grams in the filter. Wrong again, it works great! It puts 99.9% of the grinds in a neat mound in the middle of the filter, much better than I can do by hand. With the grinds in a neat mound in the middle of the basket I can tamp them down without spilling any grinds (again, something I can\u2019t do when putting grinds in the filter by hand)!\n\nBetween even and consistent grinds, including the very fine grind size needed for non-pressurized espresso, the timer and the ability to dispense grinds directly into the filter, this is a fabulous grinder at this price and I think can hold it's own with machines at twice the price. Some complain about uneven grinds at the coarse setting. If all you want is French press coarse grinds then you don\u2019t need an espresso focused grinder, save yourself money and buy the Cuisinart DBM-8 for only $40.\n\nFinally, the issue of reliability. All I can say for sure is that mine came in great working order, and while I have not had it long enough to vouch for long-term reliability, since it is solid and well-built I see no reason that it won\u2019t be reliable. But if you are still worried, consider this. If you look at the reviews for most grinders and espresso machines you will see that about 2/3 rds of the scores are 5\u2019s and 4\u2019s, with between 15% to 20% being 1\u2019s, primarily bitching about reliability and warning you not to buy whatever it is. Well in this case \u00be\u2019s give it a 5 or 4 and only 12% are 1\u2019s. I see this as a testament to it\u2019s build quality and reliability \u2026 just sayin'.\n\nIf I experience issues in the future I will post an update."

We purchased our first one five years ago, and loved it - after five years of lots of grinding nicely, we got an odd bag of espresso beans that had some little stones in the bag with the beans. The company stated that it was sorry but because it is a natural product (like beans), things like stones are a possibility but not a probability. We do believe that the grinding burry MAY have been slightly damaged or at the very least, dulled by the rogue stones. Replacement burr's are available from Breville, but they have also discontinued the model that we had purchased five years ago.\nWhich brings us to this newer model being a new star on our counter top. The new machine (comparing it to the old model) is pretty much whisper quiet. It also has a grind timer. When I make an espresso, I like to double tamp the grind in two stages. Fill it half way, then tamp, then fill it the next way and tamp again. The timer set at 10.5 seconds for each pulse works perfectly for the double porta-filter that goes with our Breville Infuser espresso machine. The machine gives a fantastic personal taste grind. The settings alone might take a while to dial in to your preferences. For me, thankfully I just set it at about the same settings for my old grinder and managed to get pretty lucky by only having to tweak it a bit.\nParts are available online at Breville as far as outer parts (the grinder itself), and not the internal gears. With the way appliances go bad of late, (it seems that nothing can last longer than four or five years), I'm more than pleased that this grinder is doing my morning grind for me. I truly believe that the days of an appliance lasting a lifetime is LONG gone, which means that if I must replace more often, I will at the very least make sure that I get the best replacement possible. It's a purchase that I'd make again!"

For this price range it's a great choice.\nIt looks great, is extremely easy to use, is fairly quite (no burr grinder is super quite), has a sturdy build quality, and grinds coffee perfectly to your exact specifications. This model always makes the top 5 burr grinder rankings and I now understand why. I originally had the much less expensive cuisinart burr grinder and it did a good job but nowhere close to this machine in terms of grind accuracy and the ability to go very fine plus it was a messy operation with that machine (coffee grinds always spilling). If you love coffee spend the extra bucks and get this machine!"

            "reviewText": "I was hesitant to review a product that I've owned for less than a week, but if my opinion changes, I will come back with an update. Let me preface this review by saying that I am comparing this burr grinder to what I considered to be the gold standard: The KitchenAid Pro Burr Grinder. If they still sold it, I'd have bought another without hesitation. I couldn't even find replacement burrs to have it rebuilt...which brought me to my search. Reluctantly. I felt like I was cheating on a lover, but the day had come. After reading way too many reviews and feeling way too much ambivalence, I chose this Breville Smart Grinder Pro. I went into it KNOWING that I'd be disappointed, because nothing could compare, right? Well if you've read this long and wonder when I'm going to get to the actual review part, here it is: this grinder is amazing. It performs like my KitchenAid did when I first bought it! The precision, the low temperature, the perfection of the grind, the ease of operation, the looks? If I could give it more than five stars, I would. Initially I felt disappointed that the hopper and bin weren't glass...but guess what? I'll never break that and have to purchase a replacement again! Something that happened to me twice with the delicate glass bin. I thought the glass gave it a more solid professional look, but I'm totally pleased with the appearance of this grinder. I didn't think it was possible...but I prefer it to my old faithful. I said my goodbyes to my KitchenAid, with a tear in my eye, but now I am all smiles and filled with joy as I drink what is quite possibly the best cup of coffee I've ever ground. If anything changes, I'll update this review, but for now I'll just give five stars and say: THE BEST. Simply, the best."

            "reviewText": "After over a month I am perfectly happy with my grinder. After experimenting I have the exact grind coarseness (48) for my machine (Technivorm), the exact amount of beans (3 level scoops) for the half pot I make, and the exact grind time (20 seconds). So I just hit one button and the machine does the rest. (I may have to re-calibrate when I change the nature of the beans I grind, I realize.)\nSlight static charge leaves a dust on the receptacle lid, which I blow off over the sink, but a few taps of the jar on the heel of my hand causes all the grounds to leave the jar itself. I will probably never submerge the jar or use chemicals to clean to protect its slick interior.\nIf using the jar, carefully screw on the top all the way but not overly tight. If you do, you can push the jar just as far back in the machine as goes and you will feel it just barely \"seat\". If the open hole is dead center left/right it will be under the shoot from the grinders and one of the white scale markings will be perfectly centered facing you. When I place the jar just as described/designed, I have no spilling outside the jar whatsoever.\nBefore I fully appreciated this jar placement, I was accidentally clogging the shoot from the grinders and the machine locked down. I stopped it before there was any damage and first looked to clear the grinders, but when that did not do the job I found that the opening below was full of packed ground coffee, which released with a toothpick. Back in business and no issues in the weeks since.\nGrinder noise not a problem, though I would not call it quiet. If is high-pitched and not overly loud. The machine is large relative to many, but I would not trade. Espresso people will have to check other reviews, as I don't grind for any coffee machine but my own."

The digital time adjustment and very fine grind ability are perfect the 2-4, double espressos we pull a day. Having the ability to grind directly into the portafilter is genius! We have had the machine for about two months and are still thrilled with it's performance. Assuming it lasts a couple of years with daily use I'll be ecstatic."

Knowing the impact on the taste of coffee a good grinder can have, I was nervous about every product I viewed. I was stunned by the differences between our old grinder and the Breville. It truly makes fresh ground coffee a no brainer. Once you find the setting you prefer for your coffee, it's as simple as pushing a button to have the perfect amount of coffee ground for you every time, with NO MESS! The bean storage bin eliminates the need for an additional storage container, so even net counter space is less, with NO MESS. In addition to that repeatable formula, we find we're using less beans than in the past for the perfect cup of coffee for us. It's not as loud as our old machine, but it's still not what I'd call quiet, but it grinds our perfect pot in 22 seconds and I don't have to stand there. We've only had the Breville for a month, but we're as pleased as we were on day 1. We're currently drinking drip coffee only, so haven't tried it for espresso yet. I don't think you can go wrong with this machine. Did I mention there's NO MESS?"

It is not consistent enough to be used for espresso. By the time I realized that this is not an espresso grinder it was too late to return to Amazon. Amazon CS connected me with Breville. Breville rep suggested me using the double wall filter instead to compensate for grinder inconsistent output... Why buy a grinder then? I also noticed that the motors power is not up to task, I can hear its speed varies during 16 seconds of grinding. Again if you are looking for espresso grinder, look elsewhere. You don't need to go through the same trouble. I am stuck with it now, not a happy espresso drinker."

As my review for the Java Press manual grinder states, there is a large time commitment with the manual grinders; with more than two people, we are easily talking 10-15 minutes. The Breville Smart Grinder, on the other hand, gets us excellent espresso grounds for 4+ shots in 30-45 seconds. The espresso size grinds range between very fine (almost the size of powdered sugar) to about what I was getting out of the manual grinder (about the size of small sand). It is a touch loud, but less so than the steam wand on the espresso machine itself. Besides, who cares about talking BEFORE you've had your coffee anyway?!?\n\nNow, is it with the ~$200? We said no for a very long time and were still happy enough. But once we had some extra Christmas money left, this was well worth the treat instead of, say, a new stainless steel pot. If you are looking for kitchen gadgets and have the budget for it, this is well worth your money."

I have worked in a few coffee shops and operated a few different industrial grinder models as well as many of the home editions. This grinder works great when compared to all that I've used. There may be a grinder more suitable for the home out there but I haven't used it yet. For the price I would love to give this 4 stars because sometimes the grinds catch on top of the included catch container. I like an imaculate kitchen and think that design could work a little better. However when I consider that the process of grinding coffee is inherently messy I've never used a cleaner or more easy to clean grinder. Also considering it is just a coffee grinder it would be nice to spend less. I gave it 5 stars because I just haven't found a better grinder priced and intended for home use. Regardless I'm almost certain I won't need to buy a grinder for at least 20 years. Taking into account TVM this is a good investment. Before you buy (or not) remember this value includes a machine that is easy to use, very versatile, keeps coffee fresh, and allows you to achieve the quality some beans need to exract their taste. If you are a simple coffe drinker this may not be the investment for you. If you have fun with coffee, take it serious, experiment often, or expect consistancy than this product would work for you. I've used it for 4 months now sometimes more than twice a day. I will update this if anything to note happens."

Then every morning scooping the ground coffee into the coffee maker filter. This machine has simplified all that and saves me a little time every morning. While I'm cleaning out the coffee pot I put the filter under the grinder outlet and press a button (2x actually, 1x to turn on and 1x to grind....why?). Presto, freshly ground coffee done once I'm done cleaning out the pot. I haven't messed with the time or grind setting since day one. What a wonderfull little device.

What they had was for this newer design so I decided to replace the whole thing. This new design is actually nicer to use.\n\nI say ALMOST perfect because I am not at all interested in espresso and it is designed to accept the variously sized espresso \"dosers\" (I think they are called) and that makes for a bit of fussiness putting in and taking out the cup that catches the grinds for normal coffee making. There is a loose (by design) part that tends to pull out with the cup requiring you to reseat it almost every time. It's not a big deal but rankles!"

The Breville folks seem to think of everything. Read up on the features yourself. I don\u2019t baby it at all, and it is working like new 4 months in. I\u2019ve got mine paired with the Breville Precision Brewer, which is also really great, but I did not intentionally set out to love on Breville.

When I bought it I saw that there were many settings for fine - coarse grind but they really need to have it a bit more coarse for those of us that drink pour over and make cold brew. After a call to support I learned how to set the burr to the most coarse setting and when I set the dial to the most coarse it comes out right.

The only thing I don't like is the fact that the grounds do tend to not all go into the receptacle. Some will adhere to the top of the receptacle and some above on the delivery chute.

I mean I LOVE coffee.\n\nSo the urge was strong and very real to have this glorious piece of machinery to assist me in feeding my addiction. Let's face it, at the end of the day money gets spread around and when you think about other less fun things that money could go toward like water bills, electric bills... food, it's a significant commitment to drop this kind of cash on something that does one thing--grind coffee.\n\nBut let me tell you... it does that one thing with unparalleled excellence. In my entire kitchen there is not one appliance I am more proud of than this Coffee Grinder. It's worked flawlessly through extensive use. I love the fact that it is completely serviceable. The hopper can be removed if you want to swap out your beans. It's also nearly endlessly configurable for all your various coffee needs. I appreciate the heft and overbuilt nature of the appliance as well--it's like a Volvo in that sense.\n\nMy only complaint about this product is that the container for the grounds is plastic so it gathers static and the chaff from the beans gets married to the sides of the container. Not a huge deal--no one wants to drink chaff water anyway."

I would suggest to uses Grindz to keep the burrs clean of any oily residue and to keep it in tip-top shape. I've use coffee beans that were very oily to dry. The only problem is that really dry beans become statically charged which gets everywhere. The spout to the cup that the coffee grinds into doesn't have a complete seal which would prevent this kickback. So the best solution is to not use overly dry beans so the cleanup becomes crazy difficult."

Despite adjusting the internal settings as directed I still cannot get the coarser grind I want for french press ordrip coffee, although the grind that I am getting produces acceptable drip coffee. The grind in my drip system is coming out as small kosher salt sized flakes. So the lesson learned with the Breville is that experimentation will be needed to fine tune your grind. The good news is that the controls allow that experimentation."

We used this product for a month and a half, hoping that all the bells and whistles would be worth it. They all work great, but the coffee, day after day, variety after variety, roaster after roaster, tasted either burn and like cigarette butts. We sought to return it, but our good-faith gesture in trying many varieties of coffee to make sure it was the grinder and not bad beans took us outside of the return window. We finally purchased another Baratza Encore and the delicious, warm and subtle flavors have returned. The grind on this coffee simply isn't good: it shreds the bean terribly and must warm it excessively in the process. I do not recommend this unless you enjoy the flavor of cigarette butts and charred coffee."

I only use it for fresh ground drip coffee (none of the espresso modes), so it may be a bit advanced / expensive for me, but I like it enough to write a review.\n\nIt's simple, not as noisy as others, no mess, and no static in the container when pouring out grinds. No power switch -- it goes to sleep and wakes on any button push. It maintains settings, and I don't need to fiddle with it. It's fairly quiet (my older ones sent the dog running & crazy). It doesn't make a mess (I no longer have grinds all over the counter). The container empties easy into my filter basket without much left behind (no static cling so far). I use 30 seconds for 8 cups, with 45 grind setting. It makes a very nice bold cup of coffee using Starbucks whole bean house blend. It was easy to dial back the setting from the default 45 seconds for 8 cups, which made very intense coffee -- too intense.\n\nI've previously had a Cusinart (VERY noisy, clean but some jar static, not the best grind) and Bodum (noisy, always messy with static & grinds everywhere, decent grind). This one is the most expensive, but my favorite. I took the rubber stopper off the grind jar / catcher lid and always leave the jar on the machine. It holds in place with a magnet, and the tray below it comes out for easy cleaning if needed (I haven't had to do that, because zero mess or spilled grinds after a couple weeks' use). Recommend!"

There is a small depression where it is supposed to sit to be out of the way, but it isn't deep enough.

I'm a big fan of Breville and they think of everything for ease of use. My only issue is when using the bin with the cover, the grind almost consistently miss the hole leaving a few grams of grind on the cover. Not a big deal but not sure if it's because the vibration moves the bin around mis-aligning the hole. Anyways, not a big deal. Just sweep it into your dripper. Easy peasy. Hope for many years with this grinder!"

It can be a bit finicky getting it dialed in but once we got it dialed in we just don't touch it and it's good to go. But for the price it's got a ton of features - everything we need. The noise level seems about average for a grinder - maybe even on the quieter side - but we still installed it inside a cupboard so that it's even quieter when making early morning espresso. We're using it with the Breville Bambino and a non-pressurized portafilter. For the price, it seemed to be the best deal around when I was looked a year ago."

            "reviewText": "After about a week of use, I've found my perfect setting for my prefered coffee method, the Ratio 8. It's a chemex style system (not sold on Amazon) and needs a fairly coarse grind. There's some confusing feedback, so I'll try bring some clarity to the product. To find the perfect output, there are only two factors, quantity and coarseness.\n\nQuantity is addressed by the duration which the grinder runs. You can adjust the time directly or press the \"Smart\" cups button. The cups button is a good guideline, but ultimately you will want to measure and find the correct duration. Blindly assuming the machine has produced 'x' number of tablespoons because it was set to 'x' will lead to frustration.\n\nCoarseness is manipulated in two ways. There is a 60 setting adjustment knob that provides a good range from coarse to fine (1 is finest, 60 is coarsest). This setting is easily adjusted and should suffice for drip to espresso. I do not use the unit for espresso, so I cannot speak to that use case. Additionally, the upper burr can be adjusted to shift the range of the aforementioned 60 setting knob. There are 10 settings (1 is finest, 10 is coarsest) and the default is '6'. Ultimately, I adjusted the upper burr to '8' and the knob to '55' to find my perfect coarseness."

Hasn't clogged yet, doesn't make a huge mess and is fairly quiet for what it is. I mean you aren't going to be making silent espresso shots with any device I'm aware of, but this one shouldn't wake your great grandpa from his well deserved final rest, or your neighbors, nor does it require personal safety equipment so you can hear your boss later that day. Not terribly fiddly in it's setup, simple controls. Good use of precious counter space. And hey it looks nifty as well. We got the red one.\n\nOK it died. Got about 2 years out of it? Made the wildly expensive CLUNK noise. Seems Breville has a schedule, one year of operation per $100.00 in cost of item. Got 5 years out of my espresso maker. Completely subjective of course. Yes I'll buy another one, but don't expect it to last for more than a few years either.

Add beans to the reasonably sealed hopper and just press the start button each morning. Use the same quantity of water each morning to yield a consistent brew.\n\nFor me, the best part of this grinder is that I can extract the fresh ground coffee without spilling any grounds on the counter. Previous grinders did not have a lid on the grounds container and the static build-up would send coffee grounds flying when you removed the container. This container fits tight with multiple options for convenience.\n\nMy only concern is the grinder sounds like it is working extra hard (it is very effective) and there is an electrical burning smell. I sort of remember this smell in the first couple of days with a Breville juicer as well, and it dissipated with time."

Super easy to use. Great grind. It took 4 trial grinds to dial in the grind time and grind coarse setting. Our usual drinks are flavored lattes, X2 per day. Won't have much use for the storage container that it came with. Being able to set the porta filter direct in place eliminates the need to have, and use the measuring scoop. I used to always spill with that thing pouring the coffee into the porta filter. It took me too long to figure out how the porta filter engaged the bracket on this grinder. It sits almost on top of the bottom tray, but the grinds landed in the porta filter with minimal spillage. Our porta filter is a 54 mm. Love the way it all breaks down. Easy to clean. Our old Breville BCG450XL that we have been using for the last 4 years gave up the ghost last week, and we have been waiting all evening for the UPS truck to show up after we got the alert that it would arrive by 8 p.m.. We almost purchased a similar grinder for $800, until we discovered this one."

Perhaps it was just a learning curve but this one seems a bit more user friendly. Hint-if you are using a wet bean right out of the bag it's a bit more difficult to obtain the proper grind. Filling the hopper for at least a couple of hours before grinding these types of beans seems to make a difference. You will find adjustments are necessary depending on the bean type-if trouble arises-time too long, etc. just think bean not machine and adjust accordingly. Overall we couldn't be happier with this. Any grind can be achieved from press to espresso to pour-over...grind right into portafilter or jar."

I don't know why some other reviews say that the finest setting is not fine enough and they had to adjust the upper burr. I thought I would need to do it as well so I tested the finest setting first. But the grind choked my gaggia classic. In fact, all settings up to ~15 choked my machine.

Have to set the grinder very far towards \"coarse\" to get a grind size fit for a regular coffee machine (we use #48). Haven't tried to see if this will impact the grinder's ability to do french press well.\n2. Some static charge on the grounds after grinding (makes a mess).\n\nThe Bottom Line: It's a nice grinder but I'm not sure it's worth the price. We only bought ours because we had a gift card...\n3. The \"cups\" measurements are way off. For example, we use 4-cups according to the grinder to make 6 cups of coffee (using a 1-tbsp/2-cups rule). This seems a bit pathetic since our last grinder for a quarter of the price did this function flawlessly.\n\nUpdate NOV, 2018: We love our grinder and it continues to perform well. Any mess the unit creates is very manageable and either we don't notice anymore or it's gotten better with time. Once you get the seconds/cups set for your tastes the grinder is easy to use and very convenient. I'm still not sure you can't find a great grinder for less but I doubt you'll find a better looking one with more color choices."

With this thing the grounds seem perfectly uniform, and the taste of the espresso is consistent and so much stronger. I have a Hamilton Beach espresso machine, which is on the cheap side ($100) but does the job pretty well. When I had the blade grinder I used to use 2 double shots (4 shots) for a 12 oz americano. With this beast, two double shot becomes insanely strong, so I switched to one double shot per 12 oz cup, which actually means my beans will last twice as long, and this thing will actually pay for itself in a year or so. Although, it's worth the price even if it does not pay for itself. And my favorite feature is grinding directly into the portafilter. Pairing this with a knock box resulted in a perfect espresso making experience.\nI'm using ground size = 30 for espresso. Anything below that is too fine. If you set the ground size to minimum it would definitely be suitable for Turkish coffee. I'm Turkish, so you can trust me on that :)"

What I like the best is the ability to accurately set the dose amount. Coffee is expensive so eliminating any waste is a good improvement. The grinding burrs have been updated and are now adjustable, a nice improvement to further achieve the perfect grind. For the price this is an excellent grinder but it does have a 'built-in' lifespan. What has determined the lifespan for every one of my smart grinders has been the impeller blade wearing out. I am talking about three plus years of use to wear out the impeller blade. When this happens your grinder will begin to clog up because the worn impeller blade cannot properly expel the grinds and simply compacts the grinds until the grinder completely clogs. If your grinder is not new, and begins clogging-up, it may not have anything to do with oily beans or anything like that. Your grinder clogging-up may very well be a worn out impeller blade. Still, I feel this grinder is a 5 star purchase."

            "reviewText": "I needed a new grinder and I chose this grinder based on some reviews on other sites. Despite many third degree features that I found very nice, when it comes to consistently grinding my beans to an accurate and repeatable grind size it was unfortunately a waste of money.\n\ntl;dr- Extreme static. Display does not reflect mico-steps in grind sizes. Huge clumps in espresso grinds. Useless for dialling in multiple grind sizes. No proper pulse button. Do not buy if you make espresso at home.\n\nFull review-\n\n1- Static is a problem with many grinders but the Breville is by far the worst I've ever seen. If you change grind sizes there will be a surprising amount of the previous grind still clinging to the interior that gets pushed out with the new grind. This is utter disaster for espresso. If you change sizes significantly you will have to manually, and painstakingly, clean out remaining grinds by hand between grinds. This causes mayhem when using the provided catch bin used when grinding for French press or other coarse sizes. The entire inner surface is coated in grinds like reversed breading on a shrimp.\n\n2- If you are attempting to dial-in a grind size for espresso, or any other application, this grinder is effectively useless if you want to ever change the grind size for another use. The main display shows grind step from 1-60 but within each step you can move the dial freely (no clicks for reference as it's a stepless setup) a rather large amount. Which means you either have to find the perfect grind size and NEVER touch the dial again or you have to live with the fact that you will likely never find that precise setting again.\n\n3- Clumping. When grinding on the lower end of the scale for espresso this grinder causes twice the clumping of any other grinder I've used or seen. I've had clumps a full half centimetre in size, and larger, with most of an espresso grind clumped.\n\n4- The time-based preset is an utter waste of time. (no pun intended) I never intended to use this before I bought the grinder but it's not actually possible to to get accurately consistent results based on grin time. You want to use weight. Get a scale, weigh your beans to determine the right amount, and utterly ignore the time function.\n\n5- The main button is stop and start, with no option for a pulse. This is definitely a lesser failing than items 1-3 but still worth mentioning.\n\nThe grinder has a lot of smaller features I like- the removable floor of the grinding area that magnetically snaps back in that makes cleaning super easy. The ability to start/stop grinding by pushing the portafilter in as well as the very convenient portafilter holder. The bright, easy to read display and the overall aesthetic of the grinder. However these are all minor points of style and secondary function. When push comes to shove, the grinder does not deliver the precision, quality, or consistency of grinds that I require with renders the other features moot.\n\nGiven Breville's reputation, I am extremely disappointed."

It is a beautiful machine that's easy to dismantle and clean. It's a very high-pitched grinding sound, then when it's ground all the beans it just whirs silently. The timer is great, as is the grind adjustment [did not try the espresso grind though]. both digital. iF IT WAS LESS SLOPPY, i'D KEEP IT"

            "reviewText": "I've had the grinder for one month and, so far, am extremely pleased with it. When researching prior to purchase, there were some reviews citing grounds 'spillage' around the machine and also 'static cling'. As of today I have ground two pounds of medium roast coffee (two varieties) and have the following remarks;\n1. I have had no 'spillage' whatsoever. I am using the Grinds Container that ships with the unit; possibly the poor review referred to other types of containers.\n2. I was into my second pound of coffee before 'cling' became noticeable. The solution was to wash and air dry the container and bean hopper, and just brush out the top and bottom grinder and grounds outlet.\n3. Grind size is amazingly even. I have tried to find uneven bits in the grinds container, and failed (4 times). By comparison, before getting the Breville I was using a $90.00 grinder (won't mention the name) that did (I thought - what did I know?) a good job. Grounds went from powder to obvious bits. Static 'cling' was present from day one. Grinder had to be cleaned at least twice a week. Minor spillage required counter wipe down after each use.\n\nI have also noticed some 'strange' side effects that may or may not be related to the Breville. BB (before Breville) i washed my coffee pot weekly - there was a noticeable coffee stain on the glass pot. AB - I washed the coffee pot today for the first time in a month, not because it (visually) needed washing, but because I received a large thermos today and it needed cleaning before use and since the water was running....\n\nMy only 'con' comment (and not enough to take away a star) is that for the first week or 10 days or so, after 30-35 seconds of grinding, there was a distinct odor of hot metal. I normally grind enough coffee for a full 12 cup pot (55 seconds at #41 grind, medium roast). I don't know if the odor came from the burr grinders or the gearing, or both, but I thought it was worrisome. I loved the ground product but decided to return the unit if the smell lasted to the third week - it didn't, and has not been noticed since then.\n\nI grind coffee only for a drip coffee maker, so cannot report on the grinds for any other types of preparation. And, for what it's worth as a testimonial, I am drinking a lot more coffee than I did a month ago.\n\nStan"

Nice capacity bean hopper, intuitive dials and knobs, a wide range of grinds settings, and the accessories included, e.g., the canister, are very nice. My only complaint: I wish the canister stored better under the grinds chute, when not in use. The canister fits well under the chute when you're grinding beans into it, but when the lid is sealed, the container doesn't feel like it fits well in the space (you have to just shove it in there). This is my first grinder, and since I make French Press (for cold brew) as well as Espressos, it's a great one. For all-purpose needs, this one seems like a good one."

I was able to dial this in to a perfect grind for my Breville 840XL Infuser espresso machine with just a couple short pulls and tests. And since changing the grind is so easy that was wonderful. This is by far the quietest coffee grinder I've got. And yet it grinds as quickly as my very much more expensive grinders.\n\nThe grind path is so dead straight that you get almost no grinds outside of the portafilter. Clean up is a snap when needed which is a big plus. And as usual, Breville includes those little things that make it just a bit better. For around $225 this is a real steal imo."

            "reviewText": "This is one heck of a grinder. First of all, it's very attractive looking. It honestly looks even nicer than it does in the photos (I think the photos make it look kind of like cheap plastic, but that's not at all how it feels).\n\nThe grind size is extremely consistent and it doesn't take terribly long to grind. (Grinding 42 grams of coffee at setting 52 takes about 28 seconds).\n\nIt's really easy to adjust grind size with the big knob on the right. You have to experiment a little with choosing the number of cups or shots you need, but it's all very customizable. For instance, say you making 4 cups of coffee in a French Press. If you're like me and you measure your beans first, then put them in the hopper and grind right before using, the 4 cup setting at a coarse grind size might not complete all the beans in the time it use right out of the box. No problem though -- you can use the knob on the front to adjust the time to grind for 4 cups. It adjusts in 0.2 second increments. The one thing I haven't tested is the consistency of the weight outputted once you dial in a time. (Because I just do the weighing first and don't store beans in the hopper).\n\nI haven't tested this for espresso because I don't drink espresso, but everything I have seen online indicates it works very well for an espresso grind (for this price range, of course. This isn't a $1500 grinder or anything). It does come with two portafilter holders though, which is very cool.\n\nThe hopper seems to seal pretty darn well. As a bit of coffee obsessive person, if I wasn't trying new coffees all the time through a subscription service, I wouldn't hesitate to store a pound of beans in there and just grind what I need each morning. And honestly, the container for the ground beans seems airtight enough that I wouldn't sweat it too much leaving some extra grounds in there until the next morning.\n\nThe adjustable burrs are an awesome feature, but I haven't had to adjust them -- I've been happy with the factory range so far. (I almost exclusively brew using a Chemex and I'm happy with the grind for pour over use).\n\nIt's pretty easy to clean the machine of loose grounds, so that's not a big deal.\n\nIf you're looking at this machine, in all likelihood you're also considering the Baratza Virtuoso or Encore. I can't speak to how those machines function -- I haven't owned either. I can say that the knobs and LEDs and stainless steel of the Breville appealed to the nerd in me, and the grind produced by this machine is acceptable. Everything I've seen on the Baratza machines indicates they are absolutely excellent as well, but given that this machine and the Virtuoso are the same price, I opted for the style I like. I have not been disappointed.\n\nEDIT: Since I wrote this review, I learned a couple of things. First, the espresso-level grind is very fine and very consistent. I tried it for a cold brew and it worked out great. Second, you can hold down the start button and it will grind until you let go. If you put in an amount of beans you have weighed, this feature will allow you to either get a good idea of how much time you'll need to grind to get the amount you want if you intend on filling the hopper with beans, or, if you only put in as much as you need to grind, not have to mess with the timer at all and instead just grind until you hear that it's empty (the burrs make a very different sound when no beans are being ground). Third, I haven't found the weight output based on time to be consistent enough for my needs. I'm pretty anal about ratio and I only want to grind exactly as much as I need each time. I don't think this is Breville's fault. They can't control for bean size, etc. For the anal people like me, it'll be best to not fill up the hopper and store your beans elsewhere, then just grind what you need."

For americanos, I opened it to the right grind size and just turn the amount setting to five cups to get the proper amount. It also looks nice sitting on our counter."

Note that the portafilters are a disaster, if you put in a portafilter you have to wiggle it back and forth to get the grinder to work. You also can't let the portafilter hang or it will fall out."

If only it lasted longer than 25 days, that woudl be great.\nI make 6-8 lattes a day. After about 20 days, the first of these machines started skipping every so often and sounded like a gear was getting chewed up. It got worse and worse until it didn't grind at all by day 25. I called tech support at Breville. They suggested it was very important to clean out the machine every day. That seemed like a ot of work, but otherwise the grinder was great. Since it was before 30 days in, I was able to return it to Amazon and get a replacement ... maybe it needed cleaning more reguarly, or maybe we just got a bad machine.\nThe second one arrived and was again great ... for 22 days. Despite cleaning each day, it started making the sound of grinding gears and began to stop grinding beans. A littler research suggests that Breville decided to make some of the gears out of cheap plastic. They fail quickly and can't be replaced. I'm returning the second machine and upgrading to something else.\nThis is a fine machine if you make a espresso a day and plan to replace it about every 6 months. If you use it more than that (like me) it sure doesn't make sense. I used to think Breville made quality products. This is a machine that is designed to fail ... often and soon."

When I first got it i weighed every shot, and surprisingly it is very accurate... to the 10th of a gram.\n\nIts relatively quiet, very solid build and cleans easily. The only thing I can think of that is not to my liking is the fact if you pause the grind to settle down the shot in the portafilter you have 5 seconds, then it goes back to the beginning time. The second is if you bump the portafilter and it hits the button in the back while its grinding the time starts over. Other than that, this thing is solid.\n\nBefore I did my purchase I went over the Baratza and Breville very throughly. Both great grinders, but he pause feature vs. the on / off on the side of the Baratza did it for me. Very happy with my purchase."

I grind coarser and larger batches for French Press and drip occasionally. I've had no issues what so ever. As for the bad reviews, I think people must be using it to grind an entire pound of coffee at a time or something really dumb like that. Also, some guy posted a picture of the coffee grounds covering the front of the machine due to static. This grinder comes with a container and lid. The container w/lid fits snuggly under the grinder's shoot. The lid has a little door you open for the grounds to fall into when you grind a larger batch of coffee beans. My advise to this guy: use the lid! Problem solved.\n\nI would certainly buy this product again."

This one seems a little different though.\nMany of the reviews I read say there was a slight burning smell when you first use it, and yes; this is the case. Others also said it does go away over time, so I will update soon on this.\nI'm grinding my coffee for medium roast and I do have to say my coffee grounds a very consistant. This was an issue I was having with other grinders is the inconsistency of the grounds. Not with this one.\nSo far, it seems really easy to use I'm hoping there are'nt any issues with the motor burning out since I'm not grinding espresso beans. Knowing that I'm also not going to grind for long periods of time. More like 10 to 15 sec increments at first to break it in.\nAll in all, I am extremely happy with my purchase so far. My first impression was good and will be updating soon.\n\nMy coffee make:\nTechnivorm moccamaster KBT 741 brushed"

And, second - which I can't believe I don't see in others' reviews - the electronic sound of this machine is TERRIBLE. If the bassy whirr of a burr grinder is part of what brings satisfaction to your daily coffee ritual, I advise against choosing this model. At minimum, seek out a video review of it at Seattle Coffee website or somewhere, and listen. The thing sounds like a remote control car. I'm seriously miffed that no one else seems to have thought the sound of it worth pointing out. Maybe I will get used to this noise; let's hope so. It is the opposite of a deep and satisfying sound of beans being ground that I have grown to love."

Suddenly, it started making a horrible sound of gears grinding against each other and it stopped grinding. I returned it. While Breville has loaded a mountain of electronic features into this grinder, the company would be better off cutting out those features and using that money to improve the build quality. More metal and less plastic parts. I have a Quamar grinder that weighs upward of 25 pounds while the Breville is as light as a feather. I don't think the company can make a quality grinder with all the electronics at the $200 price point they're selling it at. Spend the extra $150 and get a Rancilio Rocky--built like a tank and will last for a long time."

It is very loud and messy and I have grinds all over the counter and device every time I use it. Very high static. The grind is not right--for $200 it needs to grind 4 cups into the receptacle included at the default settings for 4 cups. I have to screw around, wasting coffee beans (expensive beans) trying to manually find a time setting that is right and that grinds the number of cups I want. I am not sure what the point of something this costly is other than stealing people's money when it is staticky, makes a huge mess, is loud, does not bring the beans down into the burrs, so it starts to burn out the motor, doesn't grind the number of cups it is set to grind, doesn't make a difference in flavor...for me, investing in a Breville was a colossal and expensive disappointment and a lesson to never, ever, buy their brand again. I also will never buy something this costly unless it has a 3-5 year warranty, minimum. For something this expensive, the warranty is one year, which is telling of their own lack of conviction in the quality of their product and their lack of care for customer satisfaction. All they care about is taking people's money and doing nothing to earn it. I would buy another brand if you are looking for a good grinder, and do not spend this kind of money on one. I gave it two stars because, other than the grinds it spews all over my counter, it is pretty."

            "reviewText": "I have a portion of my kitchen counter devoted to a coffee bar. My wife and I drink the brown elixir daily, and rather than go out to get overpriced, burnt-tasting java, we prefer to make it at home. It saves us money and we control the quality. Our various coffee makers, frother and now this grinder are a bit of investment, but we looked at the numbers and we're saving money in the long run, and it is more convenient.\n\nMy preference is to purchase beans that are as freshly roasted as possible and grind them right before making a pot. This allows for the best possible flavor and body in my cup-o-joe. While some coffee makers I've had in the past incorporate a grinding feature, they were a pain to maintain and didn't deliver quite the results I was looking for. I've owned a white Braun KSM2-WH Aromatic Coffee Grinder for about 15 years, and the plastic parts recently started to disintegrate though the motor is still strong. I checked the pricing and was shocked to see it is going for 5x what it used to cost. Anyway, after some soul-searching, my wife and I decided to invest in a burr grinder to have better control over the final product. Most base model electrics start around $30 and the price skyrockets from there. Visiting a local store in an area mall, we were able to get this model on sale.\n\nThe Breville Smart Coffee Burr Grinder Pro Stainless Steel Burr exudes quality. It comes handsomely packaged and would make an impressive and generous gift to a home barista you may know. With a 1lb. bean capacity hopper, 60 grind settings (60!?!), and both programmable and manual dose adjustments, there doesn't seem to be anything the Breville Smart Grinder Pro can't do. With a little poking around, I figured out how get it working. The quick start guide is also helpful, as is the extensive manual in English and French. This is a serious machine with lots of parts and options, so there is a slight learning curve. You can store beans in the sealed hopper between uses, but it isn't recommended and I wouldn't keep them in there for more and a couple of days. You can grind to the provided airtight container, a coffee filter, or used adapters to dispense into a portafilter for espresso.\n\nWhile I thus far love the Smart Grinder Pro and am happy with my purchase, it isn't perfect. There are lots of parts and cleaning can be an involved affair. The power cord is very short, limiting versatility, though it does have an innovative ring on the plug so you don't stress the cord. The cord does not retract into the unit and there is no on-board storage for the adapters and cleaning tool. It does take a fair amount of counter space, but is actually more vertically compact than other units I was considering.\n\nIf you want to easily store your grinder away after each use, and don't require all the options the Breville unit offers, then a smaller, more affordable unit may make more sense. I was happy with my Braun, but am even happier now that I've *tasted* what the Smart Grinder Pro has to offer. I've used it a few times but suspect it will last give the quality of the materials. Part of the fun is finding the perfect grind for your coffee (start with the presets) and being able to switch between a french press or espresso grind at the push of a few buttons. I love how it's designed and the brushed stainless steel finish looks modern and tidy on the counter next to my Ninja.\n\n~ Kort"

            "reviewText": "I bought a BCG800 along with A BES900XL a few years ago. Espresso machine was great, the grinder not as good as a Capresso it replaced. Though Breville claimed my BCG800 didn't need the shim \"repair\" of earlier versions (and the parts were no longer available), it never ground fine enough for espresso until I found suitable shims and did the \"mod\" myself; it worked fantastically until I sold both machines this week. I upgraded to the BES920XL about six months ago (it's at least as good as the BES900XL), but I had to run out yesterday to upgrade to the BCG820 grinder... times 3!!\n\nI bought the new Smart Grinder Pro from a major, high quality, Chicago-area appliance retailer. The grinder malfunctioned. I took it back the next day, swapped it at the store for another unit which also malfunctioned. I took home a third (with an assurance I could bring back again for a full refund, if necessary), same malfunction. What the F*** is going on Breville!? I plan to call Breville on Monday to see if they have a quick, obvious fix, or it's going back and I'll probably take the plunge for a Mazzer Mini.\n\nOh yeah, the problem? The grinder will work with a bit of slow down/laboring at fine espresso settings for at most a handful of shots worth of coffee, but then it will start clacking as the internal mechanism disengages the motor from the lower burr. The problem quickly gets worse so it requires a coarser and coarser setting, and changing the fine adjustment on the lower burr doesn't help. It's either a protective \"clutch\" mechanism or gears in the drive train are \"jumping\" as the grinder seems to load up. The same varieties of beans (and much worse) went through the older model at a perfect espresso grind setting without a hitch, I can't imagine these newer machines are so inferior. It should be essentially the same design. Six different types of beans were tried. All were fresh. None were dark, burned, oily, rancid, clog-prone beans.\n\nI'm still hoping for a positive fix for this, it would be such a handy machine, but I can find no forum discussions that offer a solution, let alone address the issue. I'll try to add a new post if this has a positive resolution.\n\nBe sure to run a good sample of beans at the full range of settings before you go home with one of these, and be sure you can return it for a refund if the problem starts a day or two into ownership. I wish I hadn't sold the previous model.\n...As an update...I returned the third grinder to the retailer. All the sales people in the department were there to see another faulty grinder returned. One of them commented with a bit of shock at the realization that the rest of their stock was likely faulty, as well. I thought of having them work with Breville to have a new grinder from a different production run sent out, but I had grown weary of all the time/expense/travel I had incurred from the process thus far, so disappointed, I asked for a refund, took a deep breath, and bought a Mxxxxx Mini Elactronic. I really wanted to save the bucks and hoped the BCG820 would function like the BCG800 (seems like it's essentially the same mechanism), but no dice. So instead of risking the same kind of disappointment and wasted time pursuing other \"higher quality\" choices that I couldn't actually see in person (not a lot of retailers nationwide that stock this sort of equipment) I went with a tried - and - true choice in use at just about every quality, coffee/espresso shop."

Then for no reason at all the dreaded stripped gear breakdown issue rose it's ugly head. What will happen is your coffee will be grinding normally but then all of a sudden the grinding will stop but the motor will continue spinning albeit faster with a whining free spinning sound. Mind you now,no obstruction like a pebble or extra hard coffee bean, NOTHING!. I took the machine apart and found the drive gear indeed stripped. I should also add that if you use this grinder for Espresso you can expect failure much sooner that if you grind for drip.\n\nThe motor has a steel worm gear shaft that couples with a nylon gear. Therein lies the problem. Under the slightest stress metal wins and nylon\nlooses.\n\nFirst let me say that calling Breville customer service is a total waste of time. I began to search the web to discover that this gear stripping problem was far more widespread than I ever imagined. I also discovered that it's an easy fix but..... Breville does NOT sell the necessary replacement part(s). A further search for \"Breville parts\" did bring up the gear but each vendor that may have once if ever sold it had it labeled obsolete or discontinued.\n\nBCG800XL130 Main Gear\nPart Number: BCG800XL130\nBreville\nAvailability: Discontinued\n\nThere is no fix for this problem once it happens and believe me it will, you can toss your investment in the trash.\n\nI ultimately bit the bullet since I'm serious about my coffee and purchased a Baratza Forte grinder which I believe will keep on ticking long after I have met my maker."

This coffee grinder is the second Breville product I had to return because it simply does not work as expected. Every coffee grinder is basically two things - the burrs and the motor. Everything else is bells and whistles. I bought this product because it has some bells and whistles that my other burr grinder does not - namely the attachment for espresso portafilter that allows bypassing using the container. That particular feature as well as other \"smart\" bells and whistles worked on the item I received. What did not work was the actual coffee grinding. The 'espresso' settings made the motor turn but no coffee coming out. Coarser settings produced some output but very slow - it took me about 1 minute to fill a portafilter basket, a task that takes about 10 seconds using my old burr grinder. A closer examination revealed that coffee grounds jam the burrs.\n\nCalling Breville support was a rather negative experience. Pressing 8 to be called back simply resulted in disconnected call - so they cannot get even that right. After fifth call and being put on hold I was able to talk to a human being who told me that the experience I described was \"unusual\" and advised returning the product to the vendor - which I promptly did.\n\nOut of sheer curiosity, I searched this issue on the internet and discovered that it was not that unusual after all. Many people reported having similar problems with this machine. Some blamed the coffee, which is ridiculous especially that my old grinder has no problems with any coffee, while others pointed to a defective design of the impeller - a small plastic part that pushes the grounds to the receptacle. This looked like a possible problem with my machine.\n\nClearly, I got a lemon and that can happen to anyone. However, given the fact that this happened to me twice with Breville products, this suggests that quality control at Breville is wanting. Add to it a malfunctioning customer support line and prices twice as high as those of competing product - and you have a good reason to choosing competing products."

            "reviewText": "After hours and hours on youtube and reading reviews on every grinder from $100-$500 I narrowed it down to 3 choices and ultimately I chose the Breville Smart Grinder Pro and I'm so glad I did. The reviews got me nervous because there are complaints about the quality of the extreme course to extreme fines, but for what I'm using it for it does a great job. My wife and I got a capresso 505.01 cool grind coffee/spice grinder 3+ years ago for a wedding gift and it worked well, but the grind quality was a mix from course to fine every time we used it. So in the quest for a better cup we bought the Breville Smart Grinder and wow the results are great. We use this at home, for mainly Press (setting 60) Chemex (setting 49) and our delonghi espresso machine (setting 21). Those are just the settings that work for me currently. I do want to upgrade my espresso machine next, and with as fine as this grinder goes I'm sure it will work just fine. This unit is not loud, my wife has to go to work early in the morning and we have a baby and this machine doesn't wake the whole house. It also takes just about 15 seconds for 25g of 49 course beans made...not bad. The machine looks very nice (went with silver), and has some extra little features that I really like. 1) The bean hopper locks so I can change to a different bean. It's very simple to twist and remove. Once the hopper is empty I have found that a few beans remain, so just put the empty hopper on, and run it for a few seconds to get all the remaining grounds (not many) out. 2) Has a great display and nice adjustment knobs and easy to view settings. 3) Nothing feels CHEAP about this machine, and when I went to a Bed Bath and Beyond to see what the machines were like it person my decision was complete. 4) The machine will automatically turn off after 5 minutes of being idle. You're looking to get things done, and not having to worry about switching the machine off is just a nice little feature. 5) It goes come with a nice little grounds container with lid. Now I've found to reduce the mess it's easier to just remove the lid to the grounds container vs putting the little opening on the top of the jar open...less spilled grounds. 6) If you do spill some grounds around the container the base is removable and you can pull it out, dust it off and insert again no problem. It is magnetic so you know when it's attached again. 7) It does come with portafilter holder options if you so choose...at this point I'm just using a funnel that came with my aero press to get the grounds from my grounds container to the p-filter, but do what works best for you. 8) Hopper capacity is great, and the lid seals very well. 9) This may seem silly but the cord has a place under the unit to be wrapped up, so if you only have a short distance to an outlet you won't have lots of excess cord all over. In summary if you're looking to take your home grind to the next level this is (in my humble opinion) a great choice. I ended up using a 20% off coupon so after tax was a little over $170 which compared to the the Baratza Encore, Bodum Bistro, and Rancilio Rocky, was a great value for the money. Cheers!"

            "reviewText": "I ordered this unit using Prime Now but can't seem to find a way to link here. But I wanted to warn others about this unit and highly recommend you move on to a different unit in your shopping.\n\nI am a coffee aficionado. My main method of brewing coffee is pour over with a Hario V60. I grind approximately 200 grams of very high quality dark beans every day for myself and family and my former grinder was a Baratza Virtuoso. I love it but I get tired of replacing the plastic components that wear out and break over time. Unfortunately it locked up bad and I cannot manage to get the upper burr removed and it appears to need a more significant repair where I need to ship it back to them. I've had the Baratza since 2013 and it gets used a lot and I looked at it like 5+ years of that much use is pretty good so maybe it's time to get something new. I was also in a pinch because nobody around me sells decent burr grinders and I needed coffee in the morning ;-). I found this unit on Prime Now with same day delivery (Amazon is cool) so I went for it. Huge mistake.\n\nThis unit from Breville became fully incapacitated on DAY 1, FIRST USE. I still don't know what happened. I simply weighed the beans for the amount of coffee I wanted, dropped them into the hopper and fired it up. It went along OK dropping ground coffee into the container they provide (though it's quite messy and missed the hole a lot) then it made a sound that nothing in this world should make and all bean grinding seemed to stop. I stopped the unit and started to dismantle. Now I'm thinking rock or something. Mind you in 2 years of ordering and grinding my coffee from my seller I've never once had a rock (I had a few when I used to order Peets Coffee but never with my current seller) but I just figured today was my luck day. Nope no rock, no nothing. Just gummed up grounds and a terribly messy effort to unload, and clean the thing. My grind size was drip (42) so it wasn't like I was trying for Turkish or something. I ended up grinding one cups worth a few hours later and it did just fine so I was hoping that the lockup was first day jitters.\n\nWake up today, same exact process and same exact results as the catastrophe on day 1. Now I'm upset. The unit will go back and I just ordered a replacement Baratza. Mind you it's going to cost me a lot more to get the Baratza but life is way too short to mess with this thing for another minute. I'm not paid by Baratza or anything to write this I'm just keenly aware of how good their product is now after trying a terrible product. I have a couple of things from Breville and they are really good but this grinder is just really bad. I ended up getting a commercial unit that's all metal (Baratza Forte BG) so hopefully I'll have fewer issues with the wear parts.\n\nIf you still put this in your cart and are all in, take a hard look at the second picture of the burr and get ready to spend some time everyday cleaning that out. Not for me . I should have read some of the more critical reviews before buying."

I have ground well over 300 pounds of coffee through my first one which still works by the way, and a few days ago I decided to order another as a backup. I cannot speak of the other customers experience I can only speak about mine. If I do a really light roast on a particular coffee I can tell the machine is worked harder but that is about it. No I do not clean it every day or even every other day. If the machine died tomorrow I would still be more than satisfied because I know it is living on borrowed time at this point."

We use it multiple times per day and it's always good, nothing else quite like it for control and consistency. We are very picky about our coffee, we order our favorite beans and grind one or two cups at a time as needed for maximum freshness. Once you find the control settings that deliver YOUR favorite grind this machine delivers that again and again, exactly the same every time, perfect.\n\nMy real test for value is whether I would buy something again if the one I have failed, in the case of this coffee grinder the answer is a resounding YES!\n\nIf by some chance you get a dud, just order a replacement, these are inherently strong and heavy duty machines. Ours has always been flawless in function. When we go on vacation we grind up a plastic bag of coffee and take it with us, just the right amount for the days we'll be gone.\n\nI looked around in some stores for something like this coffee grinder but never found this feature set without more unneeded features for a higher price.\n\nWhen I was a child my father had a Kitchen Aid coffee grinder that was sort of like this but it was not automatic, he had to stand there listening to the loud grinding noise and shut it off when the level in a measuring cup was met. This Breville is fully automatic, with just a little experimentation you'll find the setting that delivers your personal grind consistently time after time.\n\nIf I had to find a fault with the Breville it is the noise level, it is not a quiet machine but no burr grinder is, the Breville is quieter than my fathers old Kitchen Aid with less high frequency noise. You can quiet the Breville a lot by just throwing a kitchen towel over it, I've wrapped the machine tightly in a large bath towel to quiet it down so as not to awaken someone sleeping, that worked pretty well.\n\nThee is nothing quite like waking up and smelling fresh brewed coffee, thanks Breville and thanks Amazon for making it so easy to find for a great price.\n\nWishing everyone delicious coffee."

Grinds coffee beautifully but always has to be wiped down and cleaned. Time for a change I thought. I was willing to spent up to $250, so I started my research.\n\nCame down to 3. OXO, Kitchen Aid and this Breville. I won't go into what the others offer, and instead will tell you why I purchased the Breville.\n\nOXO - Decent machine. Problem, the gap between the dispenser and grounds catcher is too big and finer grinds make a mess. Has a one button microprocessor operation. Also no glass catcher.\n\nKitchen Aid - Top contender. Would have bought this one, but wanted automatic operation. This unit's strength or weakness is its simplicity. Select the grind, flip switch, then turn off. No Automatic operation. Cannot remove bean hopper when full. Not slim or upright. Bean hopper is only 7oz. Not even half a pound. Has to be filled often. This one has a glass catcher (a plus).\n\nWent with the Breville. Primary reasons. Slim and upright, Nice nickel finish. 1 lb bean hopper. Completely automatic with programmable memory (presets) so you can easily switch between different grinds with the touch of a button. There's more. Bean hopper can be removed when full of beans. Ease of cleaning. The Breville has an infinite amount of adjustments for fine > coarse grind. Does pulls, shots, cups... and can adjust the amount of coffee delivered by allowing fine adjustments to grind time which adds or removes the amount of coffee delivered in 1 gram increments. Talk about precise, this is it. Tight tolerance between dispenser and grind catcher, no mess here.\n\nThen Breville just wipes the floor with the competition by including 2 porta filter holders that allows you to grind straight into your porta filter. Again, automatic one touch operation. If you have used a Breville espresso maker then you know what I'm referring to here. Push porta filter handle to start and it stops automatically, or you can press it in again to stop manually and tamp if needed. There is a removable magnetic grinds tray that facilitates cleaning, and also allows you grind into a basket if you wish. That about covers the features. The grinds.... they are precise. Even and consistent from start to finish. No rocky chunks or unevenness. Its catcher is plastic, not glass. Its large enough to accept ground coffee for 12 full cups at a time. Seals too if you have ground too much. Its a little loud during operation, but the value, ease of use and consistency it delivers makes this easy to overlook."

I read a lot of reviews and watched a lot of videos on YouTube, even called some coffee vendors to speak with their sales team.

The dial is easy to adjust and you can open up the grinder and make manual \"micro\" adjustments if needed. I don't really fell that it's necessary given the range it has out of the box.\n2- This model seemed easier to clean than the others\n3- This model included a nice canister that can be removed. We grind a lot for regular brewing but also on a daily basis make espressos, so it's nice to remove the canister and put in the portafilter holder.\n4- Really classy magnetic touches. The bottom grind catcher tray is easy to remove and the portafilter holder also clicks in place nicely.\n5- Solid build quality. This is a hefty machine and it certainly feels good.\n6- Probably my most favorite feature (that I didn't even consider when researching) is the shot selector/auto timer. You set how many seconds (or shots/cups) you want to grind and walk away. You can program this for your coffee of choice (we did for espresso) or just set it to high for drip and walk away until it's done.\n\nOverall, I believe that this has features that hits above its price level. It performs well and has taken our coffee game up a notch or three."

I had an old Gaggia burr grinder previously and would never get into the optimal pressure range making my espresso. The grind seemed to always be different and uneven. First espresso brew with this grinder and my indicator was smack dab in the middle of the perfect range. One of the very best features is the ability to set a specific amount for different numbers of espresso shots and then move the dial to create stronger or weaker amounts which basically equates to more coffee or less coffee grounds. I was able to perfectly dial in the exact amount needed for a double shot without any extra waste. This grinder is also WAY less noisy than my Gaggia burr grinder and far easier to get the container in and out of the unit. Highly recommended!"

And it was the best and great and made me happy until about a year later. One of the plastic gears on the inside completely wore out. Completely stopped grinding. Tried to cotact the company which was virtually impossible. When I did reach an actual human being I was told none there are NO replacement parts for anything in the grinder. And there was no warranty coverage that would cover that repair. At that point it became a $200 boat anchor. Went to Lowe's, bought a $50 Cuisinart and I've had that for 2 years without a hiccup. Save your money, buy a cheaper one. You can replace 3 of those if they break with the $200 that this one costs. Looks great on the outside, cheap plastic parts in the inside."

We have been following cleaning instructions weekly all along, and when we started having problems I followed all instructions on website and even used a vacuum to try and clear possible grounds. No luck.\nAs out of the warranty period we have been trying to see if we can fix it and have found no instructions on assembly, and on taking apart have found parts are welded together making it difficult to try and trouble shoot when breaks right after warranty expires.\nI would not recommend this to anyone I know, as $200 for just over a year of coffee grounds is not worth it."

It stores exactly four user programs -- one for each grind group -- that it applies to all cups/shots in that group regardless of actual grind number within the group. The user manual is completely wrong on this feature.\n\nSimilarly unhelpful is the design of the 50-54mm portafilter holders. You are supposed to be able to work an on|off switch by pushing your portafilter handle in, but this only works if you have a Breville-type portafilter with three lugs, not the more common type with two lugs. Again, the manual says nothing and does not even show that they are using a three-lug item. Also incorrect in the manual is the specification that paper filters require a coarser grind than gold-tone; even Breville in other publications states the reverse.\n\nIMHO, you should buy this -- or the simpler models -- if you want a grinder that grinds well and consistently. The bells and whistles of the \"Pro\" are poorly conceived and misdescribed. This company should hire an engineer to replace its Madison Avenue fiction writer."

Since then, the display screen has had issues, where the grind select cursor flickers. It continued to grind effectively, so I was not worried. This past year, it has flickered continuously when on, and it now randomly changes the selected amount when grinding, so it stops grinding early. I take meticulous care of the grinder, including regular cleaning. For a $200 product, I feel that Breville should stand behind this type of kitchen appliance, as KitchenAid, Vitamix, BlendTec, and Cuisinart all stand behind their products. When I called the customer service number, I was told I could either pay $89 for repair or get a new grinder at a discount. The representative was snide and dismissed my issue as \"I've never heard of this, so it is your fault.\" I emailed Breville, so we'll see how they respond and I'll change my rating accordingly.

So i decided i'll live with the machine for a little while longer, save up and in the meantime buy an electical grinder (the porlex just wasn't cutting it anymore).\nWhat i love so much about this machine is that because you can place the basket directly under the grinds you get a nice little pyramid of grinds building up so that with just a light tamping i can get a nice even basket of fairly fine grinds that allows me to pour a lovely shot without the nice explosion at the end! The first coffee i made was so strong i was literally shaking for an hour afterwards! I just can't believe what a difference this machine makes, plus it is ridiculously easy to clean, looks good, just everything you'd want in a home grinder. Expensive (with all things being relevant), but basically life changing!"

Still, after buying grinder after grinder in the $40-$90 range for years you, at some point, realize you are just wasting money. I had also suspected the variations in the coffee taste (drip and espresso) were more to do with grinder inconsistency then my process. I can say it is good to be right!\n\nBefore I purchased this grinder, I did the normal reading of Amazon reviews and found the same thing you are finding: love/hate reviews for everything. Being unsatisfied, I branched out to other Internet sources and learned about the types of grinders, and more importantly, how the cheaper grinders are in my opinion misrepresenting themselves as being burr grinders. This thing is a real burr grinder, which as it turns out produces a VERY consistent grind and does not cause you to cringe while it is running.\n\nThe things I like the most thus far:\nCoffee taste great, and it always taste the same.\nI grind straight into the strainer or espresso filter, even at 5:30am, so I always have fresh grinds.\nIt dispenses in a downward fashion, instead of out the front at a 90 degree, so it shows no signs of clogging.\nChanging grind size and time is extremely easy - digital display so you are not fighting an analog setting that moves when you bump it.\nThe occasionally small excess grinds that fall to the bottom of the grinder base are quickly dispatched by removing the base insert (simple magnet holds it in place so it is a one-handed effortless maneuver).\n\nShort if is dying and early death, I think coming up with a dislike is going to be difficult. Very happy with the purchase; sorry I wasted so much money on inferior products."

            "reviewText": "UPDATE AFTER 4 MONTHS OF USE: I love it! Just prior to boxing this and returning it Amazon I decided to give it one last chance. Many purchasers on here said the grounds jar/receptacle can partially block the grounds chute in many positions. For instance if you push the jar all the way back, which feels natural, it partially blocks the chute. This chute is extremely sensitive to being blocked. So people suggested a different receptacle, removing the lid, trying to position it better, etc. I simply removed the lid. This worked wonders! 4 months in and I have not had it bind once.\n\nAs you will see in my review below, I thought I had already tried this. Clearly I had not. I still think this product could benefit from improvement. It seems to bind a bit readily. The jar is all too easily misaligned with the chute thus causing it to bind. But if you remove the lid from the jar, you should encounter no problems from it.\n\nORIGINAL 1 STAR REVIEW: Like so many others, mine is making loud clicking noises and refusing to grind coffee. I am now on my fourth morning with it, and have already spent a couple hours repeatedly tearing it apart and recleaning it to get it working again. Sometimes it will work for 30 seconds, sometimes only 3 seconds until it jams. When it jams it must be thoroughly cleaned.\n\nI tried a million different things to get it to work.The coarsest grind settings, different receptacle that would remove back pressure, etc. I even tried buying brand new beans, just in case my week old ones were the cause (even though they're not oily, nor damp, nor do the appear to contain tiny rocks). I gave this thing every chance I could think of, no luck.\n\nI don't think it's fair to call this poorly engineered. There are so many visible things about this grinder that are really well designed, from the hopper bottom that closes when you lift it out for cleaning, to the magnetic grounds catcher at the bottom. They put a tremendous amount of thought into a lot of details, which makes cleaning this a breeze. But, there are clearly a lot of defective units out there. Or, perhaps the all important internals weren't done by the same engineer.\n\nI called Breville to see if they knew of any thing I could try before I returned it. The automated phone system offered to call me back instead of putting me on hold, it claimed I would not lose my place in the queue. \"Cool!\" I thought, \"I love these.\" Over 3 hours later my phone rings, and immediately hangs up. I Google the phone number, and the first result is a Better Business Burea profile for Breville. Their rating: D-\n\nI usually would never rate something 1 star, especially something with such an impressive exterior design. But, it's an expensive coffee grinder that doesn't grind coffee, and based on what I have seen an exchange is unlikely to help."

            "reviewText": "TL;DR: this is a great value burr coffee grinder for those who want to make good quality drip coffee and espresso at home. If you use a bottomless filter basket (real espresso), then the Smart Grinder Pro will do the trick. If you're making espresso with a pressurized filter basket, the Smart Grinder (predecessor) will suffice.\n\nIf you're making French Press or Moka Pot coffee, look elsewhere.\n\nSome questionable durability...see updates below.\n\n****Original Review****\nI'm so happy I waited this long to finally get an ELECTRIC burr grinder after years of manually grinding with the Hario Slim Mill Grinder. To think that I wasted all of those hours translated into days of my life to save a few bucks is baffling now that I've been using the new Breville Smart Grinder Pro for a couple of weeks now.\n\nFirst, a short backstory:\n\n-The first burr grinder I ever owned was the Capresso Infinity. My parents now use it in their kitchen, but I couldn't stand this grinder. Never could grind finely enough for espresso, was difficult to clean, had static build-up. Frankly, not much better than a blade grinder.\n\n-I then bought my dad a Bodum Bistro. The thing was a piece of junk and broke after only a few uses. Was never able to return it because we lost the receipt.\n\n-My next purchase was for myself. The Hario Hand Mill grinder. Very inexpensive, very effective ceramic burr grinders, portable, etc. But after about a week of using it you realize how impractical it is to spend 10 minutes grinding coffee every time you want it!\n\nThe reason I waited so long to invest in an electric burr grinder was mostly because of paradox of choice.\n\nI considered the Rocky Rancillio because I heard it was unbeatable for home espresso. Still, at $300+ and a nice hefty size, I was reluctant to take the plunge.\n\nI also flirted with getting a Baratza Encore or Breville Smart Grinder, but each was reported to have its own respective issues that only prolonged my indecision. In any case, I was ready to go for the Baratza Encore until I saw that Breville had released a new version of the Smart Grinder, the Smart Grinder Pro.\n\n~~~~Differences Between Current and Previous Model~~~~\n\nThere were a few improvements to the new model that had me sold on giving it a try.\n\n1) 60 default grind settings vs. 25 in the original. PLUS, an adjustable upper burr for an additional 10 grind settings.\n\n2) \"Smart\" dosing timer that allows you to adjust the grind time down to 0.2 seconds. The old model allowed you to adjust the \"strength\" of your coffee. I guess it was designed to be idiot-proof, but I think if somebody is spending $200 on a grinder they know that more coffee + less water and vice versa is MOSTLY what determines a coffee's strength. In any case, the old way was a silly and arbitrary way of dosing. The new way makes more sense*\n\n3) Start/Pause button instead of a Start/Cancel button. Now, I never used the old version so I don't know if this is just different wording or not, but with the Smart Grinder Pro you can pause the grind and grind timer to say, settle your ground coffee in a portafilter before continuing the grind.\n\n*This feature isn't very accurate in my opinion. I've weighed my ground coffee after using the same dosing time and had inconsistent weights. If you're serious about your coffee, I'd stick with a gram scale for dosing. I will give it another try and report back here though.\n\n~~~~Repeat Features~~~~\n\n-Removable magnetic grounds tray. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this feature. Which may seem ridiculous...but I owned the Capresso Infinity where ground coffee was constantly building up in the tray at the bottom. This made the grounds basket more and more difficult to put in place. With the Smart Grinder Pro, keeping the grounds tray tidy is so easy because of this feature.\n\n-Lockable/removable 1 lb. bean hopper. This is a decent feature that allows you to remove the bean hopper and change out your beans without spilling them all over the place. This is really only useful to somebody who keeps their beans in the hopper at all times, which I don't. I should also note that not all of the coffee in the hopper will be removed from the grinder since some of it will still remain between the burrs.\n\nIf you're looking to get more serious with your coffee, you shouldn't really be storing beans in the hopper. But that's just like, my opinion, man.\n\n-Grounds basket with \"airtight\" lid/seal. This is probably my least favorite part of this grinder. The grounds basket itself is fine, but the lid just gets in the way and isn't even close to airtight. I don't ever grind the coffee into the grounds basket with the lid on.\n\n-Comes with two different size portafilter holders (magnetic) and brush for cleaning burrs.\n\n~~~~My First Experience~~~~\n\nNow, despite my love for this grinder the first day of using it was a nightmare.\n\nI tried adjusting the upper burr on the first day of using it and then the grinder just stopped working. I called Breville, we did some troubleshooting over the phone, and the rep finally told me it was defective and would need to be sent back.\n\nMy heart sunk.\n\nFortunately, the return process was super easy (and free). They even sent the replacement before I sent my defective grinder back in (with a $150 hold on my credit card until they received the defective one).\n\nMy replacement has been working like a charm though. And with this great customer service experience, I'm not inclined to take away any points in my review here. Only time will tell if it holds up though.\n\n~~~~Pros~~~~\n\n-It's very quiet for a grinder\n-It's fast\n-It is essentially stepless, even though 60 steps are displayed on the LCD screen\n-Does a brilliant job for my MyPressi twist (read: espresso)\n-Great price for the versatility\n\n~~~~Cons~~~~\n\n-Bad plastic/chemical smell post-grind that has seemingly gone away after some use\n-Doser isn't that accurate, despite the improvement in the way it's done\n-Grounds basket lid is useless and just gets in the way\n\nSo there you have it. I will update this review as time passes. I highly recommend this grinder for the budding home coffee enthusiast!\n\n****UPDATE #1 - July, 2015****\nWell I have to say I'm pretty disappointed.\n\nI am now on my third unit because of defects. This grinder works fantastically when it's working, but unfortunately it simply can't hang with the finer grind settings. The burrs lock up and the grinder stops grinding when I'm at a grind setting below 10 usually. Sometimes it works, but it's like flipping a coin because you really never know when it will lock up.\n\nAdditionally, I've come to realize that the coarsest settings really aren't that coarse. As others have mentioned, this grinder is best for medium grind settings (and fines when it works).\n\nBreville has been great in terms of customer service, but there is really only so many returns I can deal with at a certain point. This will most likely be returned unless a solution presents itself quickly.\n\n****UPDATE #2 - December, 2015****\nI've bumped my review back up 1 star because my most recent unit is holding up pretty well.\n\nHere are some tips that I think have helped prevent the grinder from locking up with espresso grinds:\n\n1) Always adjust your grind setting with beans in the hopper while simultaneously running the grinder. Yes, you will waste some coffee, but this is pretty standard practice when using burr grinders.\n\n2) Never run the grinder with an empty hopper. You don't want the burrs making contact with each other if you can avoid it.\n\n3) Grind in short spurts for espresso. I only grind a few seconds at a time, pause, and then resume for a few more seconds. I find that this helps prevent the motor from disengaging or the burrs from locking up.\n\nCouple of other points that I want to reiterate:\n\n-This grinder is no good for French Press. Look elsewhere.\n-I've found that the ground coffee feels pretty warm sometimes after grinding for espresso (I notice when I'm dosing). I don't have much of a baseline reference for how hot (if at all) the ground coffee should be fresh out of the grinder...but my guess is that there shouldn't be any noticeable heat. After all, heat is said to be one of ground coffee's biggest enemies.\n-The plastic/chemical smell post grind is almost always there. This is certainly disconcerting."

The impeller is what pushes the coffee out after it's been ground. If the impeller doesn't work, the coffee beans aren't able to flow down into the burr. Apparently this goes back several years. I bought mine in Dec, 2015. This issue has begun to pop-up on the BCG820, but it's been happening on other models as well, like the BCG400SIL, BCG600SIL, and BCG800XL. The BCG820 has a metal \u201carmor\u201d that just clads the impeller, but underneath it is just a plastic part similar to the other models. This metal piece doesn't really do anything other than make it \"look\" like it's metal when you simply glance at it from the top with the burrs on. The issue doesn't start happening until after it's out of warranty. Mine started happening about 6-7 months after the warranty period had ended. Breville doesn't sell the part on its website to be replaced.\n\nGoogle \"Hidden defect in Breville coffee grinders\" for details on the issue. There's a guy that sells a 3d-printed impeller for the BCG800, which can be found by searching \"BCG800XL Grinder Jamming due to Worn Impeller\""

After six months of daily use, I took the burrs and impeller out. There is a bit of discussion here and at the Shapeways site where someone has 3D printed a replacement impeller for the earlier 800 series. The initial take by the author was that the 820 series has a stainless steel impeller. No, said several owners of the 820, it's painted plastic. After analyzing, to the best of my ability (including a scratch test), I conclude that the impeller is a plastic base with a stainless steel cover riveted to it. I will evaluate after another 5 months or so, but it doesn't appear that there is any wear in the impeller, and grinding works as well as on day one. It's possible that Breville has made incremental improvements in the 820 since it was initially released. Based on what I've seen, I expect long life from this grinder."

I was really excited because my espresso was 10x better using this grinder as opposed to my $40.00 cuisineart grinder. It is definitely true about having a good grinder can mean better coffee. Anyways, my grinder died on me within less than one month of daily operation once a day in the mornings. I called Breville customer support and they were more than happy to send me troubleshooting information. Once we finished troubleshooting there was still issues so they replaced my product no hassle; however, when I received the replacement unit from Breville it died on me after the first run at grinding coffee. Furthermore, after I contacted support for the second time about a second brand new device they tried to go through the same spiel with me about troubleshooting and how my coffee grinds could be old and stale.\n\nAs a result, I gave them the benefit of the doubt and bought brand new beans that were just roasted 2 days prior to purchase. The grinder still could not grind the coffee. As a result, I called back and explained to them and the person on the phone still was saying that it wasn't the machine. I began to get frustrated because the person on the other line was talking to me as if I haven't bought a nice $600.00 espresso machine with a $300 grinder and that I didn't know what I was doing even after I have proved to her that their troubleshooting didn't provide any desirable results.\n\nAt this point I was fed up because she was not being helpful and at the fact that I have not had a good coffee since my grinder took a dump. So, I figured I was done fighting with Breville over this and I'm going to return this product. THIS PRODUCT IS FAULTY BECAUSE OF THE CLUTCH AND MOTOR SYSTEM THEY HAVE. For some reason it isn't strong enough to grind the coffee and strips the clutch and motor. And then, when you call Breville support they talk to you like it is your fault, so just keep this in mind when you purchase this product.\n\nI'm thinking they put poor quality parts in their machine that causes it to go bad like this but i'm not sure."

            "reviewText": "For years, I have had coffee aficionado friends, my mother-in-law, and a bajillion online forum posts telling me that a good burr grinder was the key to quality espresso. All the money in the world on a prosumer machine wasn't going to amount to a hill of gourmet coffee beans as long as I was chopping them up with the $20 Krups blade grinder which I've been using for 15 years. But I just couldn't see how it could make that much of a difference. And certainly not at the prices that rivaled the espresso machines they were meant to feed!\n\nBut for that same 15 years I've had a prosumer espresso machine that I bought after going through several cheaper models (in our house, the espresso machine gets worked fairly hard). I've had it serviced and overhauled every few years. It's plumbed in on a dedicated, filtered water line, and it's plugged into a digital timer so it kicks on 30 mins. before the alarm goes off in the morning and is fully warmed up and ready to go every day. So a couple months ago, I took it for service and decided that rather than pop for a shiny new machine, maybe I'd try upgrading my grinder to see what difference that might make.\n\nI did my due diligence and researched the options before settling on the Breville Smart Grinder. Yes, I was considering a new $2K espresso machine, but I wan't spending that kind of small fortune on a grinder! What sold me on the Breville were several features. The removable hopper (you can leave beans in it when you take it off), the adjustable grind size and dosing, and the magnetic switch triggered by putting the portafilter in place. It took me a week or so of fiddling with the timing and grind size to find the sweet spot for my machine, but once I got it dialed in I realized the advantage of the high-end grinder. For years, I could get a decent shot out of my blade grinder probably 7 or 8 out of 10 times (I had nearly perfected the art of counting a certain number of seconds). But now, I was pulling shots at just the right pressure (9 bars) with thick, rich 'crema' every single time. I had accepted the Gospel according to St. Grinder!\n\nOkay, so why did I give this grinder 4 stars instead of 5? No machine is perfect and this one has a couple of VERY minor drawbacks. One cool feature is the mid-grind pause. To keep from making mess all over the counter, the grinder can be paused, allowing me to tamp down what's in the portafilter and then pick up the rest of the dose with the same precise timing. Cool! But if I take too long to restart it, the timer goes back to the default and starts a whole new cycle. I wish the time allowed for a pause we're just a few seconds longer (a relatively easy software tweak, I'd guess). The other downside is the hopper is just a little shy of being to hold a full pound of beans. Not a huge deal, but it's a slight inconvenience to buy a one pound bag and then have to store the last couple ounces in the fridge until there's room for them.\n\nHaving said that, I just started buying Lavazza brand beans on Amazon in a one kilo (2.2 lbs,) bag. So now, of course, I have to store what doesn't go in the hopper in the fridge anyway. And here's the interesting thing: when I changed beans, I had to totally recalibrate the grinder. You'd think coffee beans are a pretty uniform size and hardness so should grind the same. But the beans from my local gourmet grocer would have to have the dial set much finer and the timer longer to get a decent shot. It took me several tries before I got the grind size dialed down to a little coarser and shorter cycle with the Lavazza beans. The bonus is, the Lavazza beans are a less expensive than the ones from my local grocer.\n\nA couple of months in, and I'm very happy with this grinder and would recommend it to any serious home barista."

I was grinding a medium light roast so if you primarily drink lighter coffees you may want to look into a different grinder. I want to get into pourovers, and am currently considering a hand grinder. I will update how that goes.\n\nOriginal Review:\n\nTo be fair, this should be more like 4.5 stars because I do really like it. Bought this a few months ago to go with my Breville Infuser and they look so nice together. It's pretty straight forward to operate this machine. The only reason why I didn't give this 5 stars is because it's not completely perfect for my use. It seems the beans that I'm using would like something between the 14 and 15 grind settings to get the optimal pressure. The 15 setting is too coarse, so the better setting is the 14. At a grind level of 14, I find some small coffee grinds end up in my espresso and start settling out as it sits. Not sure if this is due to a few stray pieces getting through the filter, or if it's because the grinder is creating some sprinkling of finer grinds. I just don't drink the coffee at the very bottom. For the most part I'm very satisfied with its performance."

I use it for espresso with my Breville 800ESXL, grinding directly into the portafilter, and it has made a huge difference in the quality of my espresso. The digital settings remember your setting (grind time) for single and double separately so you can set it for each. Still set me off that an electric motor attached to a burr costs $200 but there is really NO comparison in the quality of grind to the cheaper burr grinders. My recommendation is if you can afford it then you won't regret it."

On grind setting 15, it makes a perfect grind for my espresso maker, with plenty of room to go finer as the burrs wear down. My only complaint is that neither of the provided portafilter cradles fits my Gaggia Espresso portafilter. But that's okay because it's easy just to hold the portafilter centered under grinder outlet, and fill it without losing any over the edge. It was easy to dial in the grind setting and duration to get my desired 25-sec double shot. Some reviewers say it is noisy, but it's quieter than my old one, so I'm happy. It's also easy to clean the upper burr, and the hopper lid has a nice seal that keeps the beans fresh."

Just an FYI though, I use it exclusively for drip coffee as I have a high end Mazzer for espresso, which takes forever to dial in, so adjusting between espresso and drip would be impossible. This grinder can supposedly do espresso, I've just never tried it for that.\n\nIt is very easy to clean, and because the adjustment occurs on the bottom side of the two grind plates, when you reinstall the top plate your fine/course setting is preserved. It is fairly noisy; you will not be carrying on a conversation while it whirs away, and if your place of installation is very close to a kid or guest bedroom, it may wake them up. The canister it comes with butts right up against the output of the grind mechanism funnel so you won't end up with grounds spraying everywhere like some competing models in this price range. The canister also has a rubber sealing top, so if you grind more than you need and want to save it for the next day, no real harm done.\n\nLast but not least, reliability. If you read through the reviews, you'll realize that this grinder has a significant weak point in a metal-covered plastic gear that sits under the grind plate. Many reviews point to this gear as having worn out, and Breville not treating it as a replaceable part. I nearly didn't make this purchase over this fact because I find it fairly obnoxious they would not sell the part most likely to break, which not only inconveniences the purchaser, but results in an easily avoidable significant contribution to land fills. The competing models in the same price range just had too many feature concerns though, so in the end I went forward with it, however, only because Amazon had the option to bundle a $30 four year warranty on it, so if that stupid gear does fail, I know I can get a new unit easily. It won't save on the waste, and I wrote a nasty letter to Breville about that, but I just couldn't pull the trigger on a competing model with less features."

We had to change the removable upper burr to the coarsest setting, 10, and the electronic dial to the coarsest setting, 60, and the coarsest we could get was medium grounds. The grounds were consistent and it's a good quality, but not coarse enough for standard French Press and most definitely not possible to achieve, \"the coarsest French Press\". Maybe, one could argue they are on the edge of the finest possible coarseness for French Press.... but who wants a grinder where you are forced to use the very coarsest extreme to only get the very finest extreme for French Press? Pushing my French Press's filter is a 20 second chore with grounds from this grinder's extreme coarsest setting.\n\nI called Breville Customer service to try to find out if maybe my machine just needed an adjustment or was possibly defective. They have you leave your number to call you back, but they never did. That was more than a week ago, so thumbs down to their customer service.\n\nI trouble shooted user error reasons for not being able to get coarser grounds. I tried using medium, light, and blended roasts. I would take out the upper removable burr and brush out all the grounds around the lower burr to make sure it wasn't clogged and just making the grounds extra fine because of a dark roast clogging it up.\n\nI'm giving the grinder 4 stars still because all of the other bells & whistles and positive comments are true. But knocking it a star because it doesn't achieve the wide breadth of grounds like they advertised. You'd think coarse grounds would be easiest to achieve but sadly it's just not the case with this grinder."

I was very impressed with the grinder. It offers plenty of range to spare at the finer settings to dial in and make small adjustments as the beans age. The grind appears very consistent in size and timed dosing comes out consistently each time. (Although I have not gone so far as to weigh each dose to see just how close to one another they are.) It has a lot of great features. The large hopper is designed well. I wish my Baratza Vario held the same volume and the hopper could be removed so easily with beans in place. The airtight gasket is a nice touch. I find the digital controls very easy to use. The portafilter holder and shield do a great job containing and funneling any flying grinds, and the nice, cupped, magnetically attached tray makes it easy to keep things clean. Should my own current grinder go down, I would definitely consider buying a Smart Grinder Pro for myself, at hundreds of dollars less than others with comparable features. I have no idea how long the grinder will hold up after daily use. However, I have only had excellent customer service/repair from Breville on other appliances by them I own, even when out of warranty. The unit is lighter in weight than I expected, especially when compared to the Vario. However, it does not skate around the countertop or feel like it will topple over, so I don't think its weight will be an issue for concern. It's a nice grinder that should work very well for most home espresso makers. Breville has really upped the ante on entry-level grinders for espresso. Bravo Breville."

            "reviewText": "I've been using this grinder for more than a month now, and would recommend it to others. I had a earlier version of the Baratza Encore, which ground well, but I always had to shake or otherwise stir the beans in the hopper to get them to feed correctly. Furthermore, the simple analog timer was not very useful, so I would grid a bunch of beans, then store the grounds, which defeats the purpose of having a grinder, and I still had to measure the disred quantity. After a while, I just stopped using the Baratza, and just had beans ground at store.\n\nThe Breville works much better for me. The beans seldom get \"stuck\" in the hopper, and the digital automation means I just a button or two to get the desired quantity and grid texture I want. The hopper top has a nice rubber fitting, which does a good job of minimizing air getting to the beans (but it is still open at the bottom), The outside is metal, not plastic, and the unit comes with holders and a bin for grounds. There is also a ton of custom settings, more than you will probably need. Currently, I'm only using the grinder for drip coffee, but it's such a pleasure to use I may have to purchase an espresso maker, as my old one died."

Just like many other reviews have stated, this machine is likely to crap out on you quickly! I got this machine in December of 2015 and used it about 5 times a week since then. Things started getting dicey in July when the machine started to make strange noise and then it would skip. Now it only skips and won't grind at all.\n\nTo be fair, maybe I should have cleaned it more. I ran white rice through it a few times, but that was it. I'm getting a replacement sent to me from Breville, but if the next machine breaks the same way I will ask for a refund, bite the bullet, and buy the Rocky.\n\nUpdate: I spoke with Breville support and they were awesome. They walked me through how to fix the machine and how to keep it from jamming up. The reviews are correct in that Breville support is quick and very attentive."

This Breville grinder looked wimpy by comparison and I was wondering if I really needed an LCD screen and a bunch of knobs on a grinder.\n\nI bought this soon after replacing my Gaggia Baby Class espresso machine with the Breville Infuser BES840XL Espresso Machine. The MDF grinder wasn't cutting it in terms of producing a fine enough grind for this new machine, so I took the leap. I'm glad I did. My espresso is so much better now and I've tried a number of different coffee roasts from medium to very dark and oily and the fine tuning that the Smart Grinder Pro allows really makes the difference.

The controls are easy to use on the front, but the side knob for the grind size is a pain. That requires a lot of difficult turning if you need to go back and forth between an espresso grind (fine) and a french press (very coarse). It is very cumbersome and nowhere near as easy as the other controls on the front. I'd prefer 4 or 5 presets for the grind size and then maybe a knob to fine tune it.\n\nThe bottom compartment is very easy to detach (magnetic) and easy to clean."

The grind is consistent and the grinder is a fair amount quieter than my old Solis. One caution, when you wash the bin when it first comes out of the box, make sure it is completely dry before using. I didn't let it dry completely and the residual moisture caused the coffee to clog in the burrs and I had to remove the bin and clean the burrs. Once that was done however, the machine worked fine and have had absolutely no problems since. Good machine-- recommended."

This is far superior and has impressed me so far (one month of use) with it's solid construction, thoughtful user interface and DB level. The grind receiver is cylindrical, which makes pouring easier and so far stray coffee particles are not excessive. It is plastic and the grinds to stick a bit with a static charge. That is so far the only negative."

            "reviewText": "I had an eye on this machine for many months and I finally bought one when Amazon pricing algorithm tried to match the rediculous low prices from the other sellers. I was tempted many times to buy the open box but I am glad that I didn't and bough new instead. I bought this on an impulse because my espresso machine, Breville BES870XL also has built in grinder, and I don't see it adds anything to my espresso. I also grind coffee with a blade grinder for pour over coffee. I have not done any blind test but I can tell you that people who claimed the burr grinders for better coffee is bullsh*t. Having said that, I got good deal so I don't regret at all.\nI watched many video reviews and comparisons between this model and the others, and I can tell you this is the best for the price and performance ratio. You can't find any conical burr grinder out there that comes with many great features as this one:: 60 grind settings, nice LCD display, accurate timer for dose control, pause and resume, power saving, portafilter holders, removable bean hopper.. for less than $200. I have looked at these models in the same price range: DeLonghi America KG521 and Cuisinart CMB-20 which disappeared after released to market. You can step up to to Rancilio Rocky which is twice the price but I doubt it gives you much more for the money.\nI have been using it for a month without any issue so far, and I don't need to cleap up the mess as I need when I pull up the cover of the Krups blade grinder.\nI just set the duration and grind size that typically for the pour over brewing. We just need to put the paper cone filter underneath and press the button until the grinding finishes. The ground coffee is very uniform for coarse and fine setting as many reviewers reports.\nSo why did I give only 4 stars? It is 4.5 stars and I knocked off 1/2 for the maintenance requirement and this is not just for this grinder but for any burr grinder out there. Once for a while after finishing the beans in the hopper, I open up the grinder and brush off the super fine ground coffee that is stuck in there, or use paper clip if needed. I need to do more often if I use oily beans. My $20 Krups blade grinder is still running after 20 years without additional maintenance and I don't expect this one, 7-8 times more expensive to last that long. The idea of switching the hoppers for different beans is not that simple without grinding and flushing out the old coffee which is a wasteful to me.\nThe bottom line, if you want a little gadget in your kitchen or for your espresso machine then I strongly recommend this one. If you are looking for better brewed coffee then buy better beans, not the grinder.\n10/12/18\nMy grider still performs flawlessly. I grind 2-4 times every day since I got this."

            "reviewText": "This review speaks to one specific problem that other users have reported. It has to do with the torque-limiter/clutch disengaging, making a horrendous noise and leaving the smell of ozone in the air.\n\nI had this problem and was constantly clearing the chute that transports ground coffee to the hopper. Last week it struck me what the problem was. My placement of the hopper was partly blocking the chute causing ground coffee to back up into the mechanism, become compacted, and prevent the machine from operating properly.\n\nMy SOLUTION, working fine for the past week: The hopper must be pushed all the way back in the front opening until it is snug up against the rear wall. This allows ground coffee to fall freely into the hopper without clogging the chute and causing the clutch to disengage. (when you glance at it, it may seem that the hopper opening is too far back. It's not.)\n\n(It's working beautifully now. Four stars at this point for very small things like the timer returning to default setting when unplugged and difficulty removing the grinding mechanism for cleaning. Otherwise, I'm more than satisfied with the quality of the grind I'm getting.)"

            "reviewText": "I owned this product for 25 days and then out of the blue the burrs seized and I returned it under Amazon's 30 day return policy (thank God).\n\nThings I really liked about this grinder were:\n- aesthetically, it's just really cool looking, in a retro way\n- it does grind quickly, and the hopper holds a ridiculous amount of coffee\n- the display and functionality are well beyond what most cheap burr grinders provide\n\nThings I did not like:\n- most importantly, this grinder produced a lot of coffee dust. This dust showed up as: grinds sitting at the bottom of the pot; sludge in the bottom of my coffee cups; and weirdly, a thick white-ish line at the top of my coffee as it filled my drip coffee maker. I thought all this was normal, since this was my first burr grinder. But I've since replaced it with another, and the new one doesn't have any of this\n- kind of loud\n- the dosing control is by time, not weight. It makes some kind of calculation based on your grind size (e.g. medium, or fine) and how many cups you want to make. But it's a very \"ballpark\" method. For instance, grinding for 12 cups on a medium grind (a typical full pot of drip coffee) you could get anywhere from 90 to 110 grams. Truth is, WEIGHT is what determines the appropriate amount of coffee, not grinding time. There is in fact a grinder at a similar cost (the Oxo) that doses by weight. Grinding by time makes no sense at all\n\n- and of course, a huge, huge con is that after 25 days of working well, it just suddenly started making hideous metallic grinding noises. It was clearly broken and I was very thankful that I had purchased it on Amazon. In a half hour, it was boxed, shipped back, refunded, and a new grinder from another company was on the way.\n\nI am giving it 3 stars, because when it's working it's a pretty good device. But it was certainly disappointing to see it fail after 25 days, that's for sure."

            "reviewText": "I've been using the same blade grinder for the past 15 years, and it finally gave out on me. Encouraged by a friend to step up my coffee game, I decided to upgrade from a simple and cheap machine to something a bit more sophisticated and expensive. I looked around at several models, and had a lot of difficulty choosing a burr grinder. For expensive machines, many seemed to have problems with durability. My friend recommended the Baratza, but I read enough reviews of people having problems with that brand, that I shied away from it. This led me to the Breville BCG820. It's a newer model than the 800, so I'm hoping that they fixed the issues that people seemed to have with the previous model. (Fingers crossed!)\n\nOne advantage to this model (compared to the older 800) is that you can simply dial all the way from espresso size to French press. The dial feels heavy since you are moving some gears up and down, but it feels solid. The grinds, in my amateur opinion, are fairly uniform, and there is definitely a difference in size when dialed in.\n\nThere are a few things I'm confused about though. When you grind, it grinds by time, and not weight. I would rather know that I'm grinding 30 grams of beans rather than grinding for 20 seconds. You would think on a machine at this price, it wouldn't be too difficult to put a small scale on the bottom.\n\nAt first I was weighing my beans, pouring them in the empty hopper, adding a few seconds to the automatically selected time, and stopping the grind manually when the beans are all gone. Now I've realized that the grinder remembers your time, so I leave it at 13 seconds for a coarse grind.\n\nAnother method it took me a few days to figure out was just simply holding the start button down until the beans grind, and letting go when I finished. This is only a secondary method, because who wants to hold a button for the entire grind?\n\nIf you do not care about specific weights though, the system easily lets you dial in for the amount of cups or shots that you are making, and you can increase the time of the grind to effectively increase the amount of coffee you want.\n\nThe hopper at the top holds 1 pound of beans. Although it's air tight at the top, still there is a lot of room for air in the container itself, so I do not leave my beans in there. Another reason I don't use the hopper is because I just want to grind a certain amount, and weigh my beans and just pour what I need into the grinder.\n\nFrom beans to grind, there is a bit of mess at the bottom. If you use the provided container (with the lid), there will be hardly any chaff that sticks to your appliance, but the chaff will stick inside the container. I just blow in the container and it usually comes out. I have not used the provided collars for the two sizes of portafilter, but there is a slight mess, especially if you decide to grind directly into a container other than the big plastic one provided.\n\nSize - For me, having limited counter space, going from a blade grinder to a dedicated machine was a big choice. It's relatively small for a kitchen appliance (about 6 inches across) so I would say it's not too bad, and well worth it to have good grinds, but it is another thing to have on your countertop.\n\nBurrs - I decided to go with this brand because of the metal burrs. I'm mainly grinding for French press and moka pot, so I don't need the fine grinds that ceramic burrs can provide. Even if I decide to delve into the world of espresso, I've read that this machine does a decent job with fine grinds.\n\nOverall - I'm glad that I've decided to invest in a better machine. I've noticed less silt in my French press, and the uniform grind makes brewing the coffee better because beans should brew for the optimum amount of time, and various sizes of grinds will make the coffee more bitter. Hopefully this machine lasts though. It's an expensive investment for coffee, and it can't be that difficult to make a grinder that lasts for a few years in this day and age, right? ***Fingers crossed*** please last Breville 820!"

To get it out of the way, IF you can get it to grind enough beans for a pot of coffee it DOES make a difference and makes the coffee taste better than the traditional $20 Krups grinder. The bad new: It clogs, it stops, it burns the beans, the beans stick in the hopper. You have to swirl the beans in the hopper to \"hope\" that they continue grinding. when that fails you have to shake the entire unit for the grind time to make the beans feed. Then that makes the lid fall, which makes the beans fly out. The manual says that the grinder need to be cleaned to keep it running well. IF you clean the burrs, the grinder will work \"ok\" for about 2 days, then it is back to the shake procedure. I have called tech support more than once and never got a human, leave a message to be called back..never heard back from them. The way i figure it a coffee grinder for $200, this thing ought to grind coffee AND be bestowing sexual favors, sadly it does a barely adequate job of doing it's intended job. I would return it but the return window has closed. Save your money, look elsewhere."

Some reviews say it is quite, well if you think a car with a broken muffler is quite compared to a car with no muffler than ok I will agree to that. It is by far the quietest grinder I have ever used and it has no muffler at all!\n\nNow I don't think it grinds beans better than any other grinder I have ever used. That maybe that I just do not challenge its capabilities, that my needs are more basic. What I do like is that the grinder controls are easy to use and it gives digital feedback on what the settings are. I am still playing with the controls to see what works best for my taste. I also like the bean chamber being larger than any other one I have ever used. It takes a full bag of about 1 pound or so.\n\nWhat I was surprised and pleased about is the lack of a mess. I ordered an extra large bush to help clean the coffee grind container. Since I like my dip coffee fine other grinders have done three things:\n1. Either spit out grinds outside of the grinder container or\n2. When I pulled the container out of the grinder and opened the lid to get the grinds fell off the lids (and yes I beat the container before opening it)\n3. Static made grinds stick to the sides and bottom and made a mess getting them out\n\nThis container captures all the grounds and has no static cling at all! I have not used the bush at all! This unit eliminates about 99% of the mess!"

            "reviewText": "About 20 years ago, a friend introduced me to coffee made with a French Press. I had known of the method but had never tried it. At first I found the coffee to be much too strong for my taste. But I soon developed a preference for it.\n\nEven before that, I had been grinding my own coffee beans, using a blade-type grinder. I learned that I needed a burr grinder to get the coarse grind needed for a French Press. I bought a Capresso grinder and it worked for several years. Then I bought a Baratza Maestro Plus burr grinder. It recently stopped working. Both models had a coarse setting for French Press.\n\nRecently I researched various burr grinders and settled on the Capresso Infinity Burr Grinder. I bought it from Amazon. Upon using it, I found that its most coarse setting was much too fine for French Press coffee. I returned it.\n\nAfter further review, I decided to buy the Breville Smart Grinder Pro Stainless Steel Conical Burr Coffee Grinder. It was a bit pricey at $270 but I enjoy coffee and a grinder is something I would use every day.\n\nI was quite disappointed to find that despite 50 grind settings, the Breville Smart Grinder Pro would not grind coarse coffee even at its most coarse setting. The machine is a beauty, with many fine features. But it is not suitable for making French Press coffee.\n\nThis week, I went to the store where I have been buying my coffee beans for years. They have a commercial-duty Bunn Coffee Mill for customers to use. I set the grinder to \u201cFrench Press\u201d and the grind was quite coarse, perfectly suited for making French Press coffee. I would love to be able to find a home model grinder that would grind coffee to this texture. I will be returning the Breville Smart Grinder Pro."

I ponied up the funds for this grinder and I'm totally satisfied with the purchase. It looks good sitting on the counter. It's easy to setup and use. It's incredibly easy to disassemble and clean. I'm also very happy that there is memory on whatever circuit board lives inside. You can unplug the unit and it remembers your grind settings from the last use. If you stop mid-grind it'll hold it's place for a few minutes so you can resume, like if you forgot to top off the hopper with beans and almost ran out mid-grind. After a longer time it will reset back to your full grind settings. When it does this it also \"turns off\" in the sense that the screen backlight is disabled and off. Noise is average. It's quieter than my previous DeLonghi grinder, but it's not whisper quiet as one might hope for a noisy morning device. It's still a set of grinding teeth pulverizing the soon-to-be-savior of your morning. I would compare it to a Kitchenaid stand mixer or perhaps an immersion blender. You can hold a conversation while it's running, but you'd have to turn up your voice a few clicks. One other thought...when it's off and you want to fire it up in the morning you can press any of the three buttons and it doesn't change any settings or automatically cause the machine to start grinding. The first press is just a \"wake up\". You can still review your grinding settings before telling it to go."

It took some experimenting to find the correct grind size and grind time and since we found those our coffee is consistently excellent every time. With other burr grinders we had tried, and given to Goodwill, the biggest drawback was how hard they were to clean. This is not a problem with the Breville as cleaning is easy and you do not have to clean it after every use. We are very, very pleased with our choice."

I was told that you need to run the grinder on a coarse setting first, and while the beans were going thru, then turn the dial to fine. This seemed ridiculous to me. I asked if this was stated in the manual (it wasn't) but the Breville customer service person acted as if this was common knowledge.\n\nI bought this specifically for espresso grinding so this poses a problem since I don't want to mix the course and fine grounds together, or waste beans while running a coarse setting first. Didn't matter anyway, the course setting didn't work either."

The motor appears to have a hard time on the espresso setting (14) with higher density beans. I changed it to a coarser setting and it helped, but I'm disappointed that this grinder seems to struggle with its basic function of grinding coffee beans. (I also went through the troubleshooting process twice of checking for any foreign objects that may have gotten stuck in the burrs and fully cleaned it out.)\nFurthermore, when I called Breville customer service, they recommended starting at the coarsest setting of 60 and gradually move down as I ground my coffee beans. I'm going to assume that most of you that buy a $200+ coffee grinder don't want to go through a whole bag of expensive coffee to find the finest setting that won't break your grinder. Breville customer service expects you to. (Btw, their customer service is slow and it took more than 20 minutes to get through to someone for assistance.)\nSo needless to say, I'm disappointed by both the quality of the grinder and the quality of customer service."

They were certainly right."

Since the static buildup is bad, you must wait between batches else coffee goes everywhere. I do like the digital display and the good selection of grind size. It\u2019s also quite easy to clean."

            "reviewText": "This grinder... Oh God, this grinder...\n\nFirst of all, let me start by stating the good here. When it works, it makes a very servicable grind for Turkish, which what I mainly used it for. The coarsest settings were a bit uneven in terms of particle size and consistency, but who's complaining? And when I say a bit, I do mean a bit. Not at all enough to change the flavor for French press or Chemex, (though Chemex does go for a finer grind). But all in all, the grinder was a very good buy in terms of performance... as long as it worked.\n\nI cannot begin to describe the nightmares I've begun to have when I even think of grinding even the tiniest amount of coffee in this grinder, for fear of listening to the near instantaneous grating cacophony of the clutch slipping. At first, I couldn't believe the fact that this $200+ grinder has a motor so weak that it has trouble grinding beans on the finer settings. Are you serious? Why bother giving us the option to grind fine, when clearly the cheap piece of crap motor, belt & pulley system or whatever the heck they use to spin their burrs can't handle the pressure? It's disappointing. I got this against my best judgement, and now I don't believe I can even return it, since I had it shipped overseas. Please DO NOT disregard the warnings of other reviewers cautioning you against the clutch and motor issues. They are horrible. I cannot even begin to put into words how frustrating the cleaning, the mess, the unlocking of the burrs was, just to grind a few measly grams of coffee. Eventually I resorted to grinding the entire bag (12 oz) all at once when the thing worked fine. That was only thrice, though. I now switch it on if I need to raise my blood pressure.\n\nIn summary, do yourself a favor and get a Rancilio Rocky or go all the way and look at a Mazzer Mini (like I did now) and save yourself the extra cost of buying a machine you want to just throw off the highway of a coastal area, and watch it bounce and smash itself to smithereens on the rocks and ledges below. And for the record, I'm not even going to consider a Breville espresso machine, no matter how many people or reviewers say that its the best thing in home espresso. I'll stick to something more tried and tested and reliable, like a Rancilio Silvia or something."

I like to do extensive research and comparisons before I purchase an important item for myself like this. All the reviews I read suggested this machine was going to be able to meet my needs and give me the longevity for my coffee consumption I was looking for. Out of the box it looked amazing, with its bright red color and sharp design. Operating it was simply and I quickly dialed in the # settings for my chemex, V60, and Kalita wave. I was stoked to say the least. I mainly used the setting 56-60 +10 on the upper burr. The quality I was getting was superb. I would safely say I ground no more than 8 pounds of coffee through this machine when the issues started. First a ratchet clacking noise with movement of grounds halted. I stopped it immediately. Cleaned the upper burr and let it cool down before restarting. It worked fine for maybe another day of use. Then the issue resurfaced. I did the same cleaning routine. It once again worked but this time with a continuous clacking sound. Upon researching this issue light was shed on this being a common issue. Usually with heavier use than a measly 8 pounds of coffee ground through it. Needless to say I was very disappointed with the performance capabilities. So let down in fact I did not want to replace this machine with another for the fear of this issue resurfacing was off-putting. The only reason this review is getting an extra star above one is because Amazon was so fantastic in working with to get this item returned and getting me on my way to attaining a new different grinder. Perhaps I just happened to purchase a bag egg, I notice a lot of people getting amazing use of this great grinder. But for me it unfortunately did not meet my needs."

My wife, who loves her Lattes, is having health issues and therefore backed off her coffee for now.\n\nOn a personal note;\nAbout 4 years ago, my Grandson has taken an interest in roasting coffee. He began using an old 'air' popcorn popper. Now, he imports the green (raw) beans, roasts and brews his coffee. He has opened two coffee shops, has a mobile wagon and has an online business as well.\n\nNow that I am able to get Fresh Roasted beans, I wanted to have a Very Good grinder.\nI am Loving the Breville and the VERY fresh coffee."

I was a little worried when I ordered this that the features were too complex: I like simple and streamlined. I did plug it in when I was getting ready for first use. That's when I realized that the button that controls cups/shots is adjustable only upwards. If you want to go from 4 cups to 3, you have to press up through the maximum to get to back to 1 and then up again to desired dose. I toggle between making coffee just for me and for others as well on a daily basis, which makes that limitation a bit cumbersome for something so \"smart.\"\n\nI decided for my simple pour over needs, this appliance was going to be more complicated than I needed. Without putting a single bean in the hopper, I decided to return it. Guess what (and this is a first on Amazon for me)? It\u2019s non-returnable. I can\u2019t see where it says that on the Amazon order page, though the rep I spoke to on the phone told me it was on there. Amazon was very good about accommodating my problem, but I still wish I could see where a buyer would know that something is non-returnable."

After about a couple of years of use, the first one started slowing down, struggling, and then failing in a matter of weeks. The same is now happening to the second one.\n\nIf you make espresso daily, do not waste your money on Breville grinders. Google \"Breville grinder impeller\" and you'll see that these grinders are built to wear out quickly, and while you could fix the old model, the new one you can't fix.\n\nUPDATE: July, 2018\nHaving nothing left to lose, I took the grinder apart, and can attest that Breville has intentionally designed obsolescence into their coffee grinders. The impeller, which is the part that is responsible for expelling coffee grinds is made of plastic covered by metal - see picture.\n\nIn the picture of the impeller, you can see that plastic \"teeth\" used to expel coffee grinds are completely worn out (they), and the metal teeth are too short. Had the metal teeth been made a little longer, there would be no need for plastic, and this part would last forever. Clearly, Breville doesn't want it to last.\n\nOn the previous model of this grinder BCG800, it was possible to replace the worn out impeller by a 3rd party one. Clearly, Breville didn't like that either, since they went out of their way to redesign the impeller assembly in a way that makes it impossible to fix this yourself.\n\nWhile it's understandable for any product to have flaws, it's a bit perplexing that a manufacturer would go out of their way to engineer the new model in a way that guarantees that the \"flaw\" can not be fixed by the customer.\n\nWell done Breville - you've lost a loyal customer.."

Oh regular drip - meh...child\u2019s play. This machine excels in the precision grind size it is capable of providing and the exact dose/weight/time for your next fix. I have become a Home based barista for my wife and kids. This machine looks impressive on my finely polished granite counter tops sitting between my drip coffee maker and my DeLonghi EC860 espresso/cappuccino machine (separate review). I chose the brushed stainless steel version to complete the look of my industrial chic coffee counter space.\n\nJust grinding the beans in this elegant beast for either espresso or drip machine will give off a permeating smell to command all coffee junkies to begin asking questions and lining up in awe with their order.\n\nMachine is a workhorse and is easily cleaned and maintained.\n\nNow the bad news. This machine is noisy. I mean wake people up loud. I firmly believe that the Breville engineer or engineering team was deaf and had no idea how loud this machine was through the design and validation process. When I say loud I mean stop your conversation because this machine demands to be heard. I think it is a key design feature to draw attention and perpetuate its use because the fine quality and smells it put out will surely cause all around to want to use it more drink more coffee and likely buy this machine for their own daily use. As such, you can use it as a morning alarm clock with the 20 second double shot #18 espresso grind. Biggest challenge is trying to make my quad flat white quietly first before my wife asks for her double shot with coconut milk and two pumps of caramel...But I digress.\n\nGreat machine. 1 star deduction for noisiness - ear protection may be required for frequent use but I have grown to appreciate the noise these finely engineered Conical Burrs and 2hp motor make when preparing my morning fix. It somehow makes me feel powerful, like starting a chainsaw or launching a rocket into space. This machine has made me a better person by providing joy, albeit in small 6-8 ounce cups, to all who care to join me for my daily caffeine fix."

After lots of research, I actually bought a third one. I have not opened it and am considering returning it. Can you only expect this much of a $200 coffee grinder? I performed all the cleaning and maintenance required. The machine is a great pleasure to use and performs wonderfully, but I am so tired of paying top dollar for things that barely last. Really not sure what to do!!! Pretty sure I am having the impeller issue discussed in other reviews.\n\nUpdate, finally opened it. The motor sounds completely different than the last two, and really sounds much less powerful and as if it is struggling. My advice is to NOT buy this grinder."

It requires way too much cleaning. The coffee begins to clump after a while. Not. Wonderful. I would recommend you consider a Baratza in this same price range.

            "reviewText": "I have a Quick Mill E61 espresso machine and use the Pro at setting 12 (11-14 depending on the bean) to deliver an excellent grind that gives me 48 ml of espresso with an 18g dose in ~35 secs overall. I mostly drink lattes, but take a couple of sips each time to get a taste of the extraction.\n\nFor espresso neat, I use 17 gm and ~35 ml in <30 sec. I use a bottomless PF and VST 18 g basket, and most of the time, I get no spritzers; and when I do, they are minor. At setting 11 and ~30 lb tamp force, I'll choke the machine, almost. At 12, it's just right, with some beans; others require 14 setting.\n\nIt's smoothly quiet. I weigh fresh-roasted (3 days - 2 weeks) beans on a small electronic scale from Amazon ($15). I put in 18.0 gm and get 17.8 gm every time, representing ~1% retention. If I tap the unit, I will get 100% recovery, every time. I grind single doses into a paper dixi cup which, upside down, fits into the 58 mm bottomless portafilter. I tap the mound so it is almost level with top of basket, and then tamp, and a light polish.\n\nZERO static--ZERO mess--almost zero retention, quiet, consistent, excellent grinding range, nice looking on the counter. Very little clumping, and the clumps break with a slight touch of the finger. For the money, my opinion is that this is a fantastic grinder and goes from pour-over 'clever' (~45 grind setting) to espresso (12 setting) and the grind is rock solid going from one to the other. It offers an excellent grind for espresso. This is not as easy as it sounds to achieve for ~$200.\n\nThe only other unit I might consider is a Baratza Vario--but--is it worth 2X the cost? Maybe. It seems much more solid; however, it get complaints also about failure to hold its setting (I think Baratza fixed this). I have read online that folks who had both give a slight nod to Vario for taste; but, how do you run a truly 'controlled' comparison? In a latte or capp, it's hard to believe anyone could tell. BTW, my taste buds are very sensitive to shot quality, even in a latte. The quality of the bean and freshness are important to me. Straight shots are sensitive to EVERY variable (grind, tamp, time, temp, bean type). This tells me the Pro is doing it's job correctly, yes?\n\nFor this price, the Smart Pro has no competition. So long as it lasts, I could not be more delighted.\n\n**My first unit was a refurb, which was awful. I discovered its rate of 1 gm per 2 secs: too slow, and it jammed constantly. I bought a retail unit and it has functioned PERFECTLY and CONSISTENTLY for almost 6 months now. Breville was supportive--very, and took back the refurb at their expense and provided a fast refund."

There is a massive range of grind sizes and it definitely can grind a variety of roasts very finely.\n\nThe machine seems to be quite well made and is smartly put together. You can take out the burrs to adjust, you can program grinds, grind in to portafilter or container, etc.\n\nThere are many more technical reviews that you can search out if you need. The bottom line for me is that it is a high quality grinder that is made well. So far it works better than expected and I see no reason why it should fail. Breville offer a 1 year warranty too.\n\nI am very pleased with this machine and the price point. I grind Black Cat espresso (Intelligentsia) and Old School espresso (49th Parallel) as standards. I have tried a few darker roasts with out incident. I imagine more oily roasts would require increased maintenance and cleaning (which is easy on this machine).\n\nAbsolutely NO issue with getting a fine, power grind.

Maybe those with problems of locking up could be helped with this practice? My original review stated static wasn\u2019t a problem. That review was only after a weeks usage. However one just can\u2019t seem to get completely away from it. I have discovered if I leave the lid off the plastic ground catcher there is less to clean up and it doesn\u2019t take away from my 5 stars!\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW: I didn't purchase here, but when I research an item before purchase, this is one of the places I come to read reviews. I've had this grinder a week and am pleased with its performance. I paired this grinder with a new coffee maker, OXO 9 Cup Barista Brain. I've been doing pour over for a couple years but, have grown tired of having to make individual cups throughout the day. I wanted something a little more automatic and with a thermal carafe. Thus, the reason for new equipment.\n\nIt has taken me a week to dial in the correct settings for the current beans I have which are a fresh French Roast. I normally weigh my beans before grinding and that ratio bean to water which gave me too strong a brew. I don't know if it was the grinder or the new coffee maker responsible and I'm guessing it's the combination of the two. I found with this new equipment, I do not have to use as many beans. I decided I was going to use the timing of the grind on this grinder rather than weighing each time.. One less step. I am happy to report that after a week of trial that I've dialed down to the perfect cup of coffee to my taste. I make a pot each day and drink it throughout the day with enough left over to take a cup to work in the evening.\n\nI've not found static to be much of a problem. It's attractive sitting at my beverage station and couldn't be happier with my purchase. I can't vouch for longevity of the item but it's ability to grind a consistent batch of beans for my drip is spot on. I do not drink espresso, so cannot comment on the grinders ability to that or to grinding course enough for French Press. However, if you have a good drip maker that brews coffee at the right temp (and I highly recommend the OXO), you can't go wrong with this grinder."

Has a lot more features to fine tune the grind. Looks nice on the counter.\n\nThe big issue is getting a coarse grind. I started with the coarsest setting, out of the box. Too fine. I followed the instructions to change the default setting. I did it multiple times until it was at the highest (most coarse) setting. I couldn't see any change in the grind each time. And, at the end of all that have stopped using the machine and got a refund.\nThis is the only reason I gave it less than 5 stars.\nIf you use a finer grind, you'd love this machine."

This bad boy is staying on the counter.\n\nI don't have anything smart to say beyond the fact that yes, you can taste a difference. Everyone probably knows that but I had my doubts. Depending on my mood, I make coffee in a Chemex and AeroPress, and stovetop espresso with a Bialetti Moka Express. You can taste the difference in all three. Andytown beans ground in this and made with AeroPress turned out to be the best cup of coffee I've had in my life. In San Francisco, that's saying something."

Obviously that's more demanding on the machine than filling up a basket once every few days, but it also makes much better coffee to use freshly ground beans. Yesterday it finally gave up the ghost and stopped working. The amount of control we had over the grind and quantity was exceptional. It's also not too loud, which is nice when you have a couch covered with groggy supermodels who are working through their hang-overs."

It was amazing the, automatic dosing control and the grind were superb for my E61 group machine. It stopped working 3 days ago in the middle of preparing a normal shot. I was able to return it for a full refund, and thought about just replacing it on the spot with the same model, but was advised against it.\n\nHerein lies the dilemma; there are few other pro-sumer models that provide the automatic features that the Breville 820 has, yet and still the build quality is in question. For example, The Rachillio Rocky is a solid grinder at $355, but is completely manual, and the next Rancillio model, with automatic dosing is around $900.\n\nWhile the Breville worked, it was an amazing machine and value. I might wait and see if the built quality improves over time (since this model is new), however Breville has had a lot of practice with the previous automatic 800XL model and should have had these issues related to manufacturing defects worked out"

Through trial and error, I've found that the ideal grind size and time setting for two shots of Lavazza medium roast espresso beans is 21 grind size/16.8 seconds on the digital display. The grind setting is at the lower end of the display's espresso range (fineness decreases as the grind size increases). This setting delivers the precise amount of ground coffee required for two shots directly into the portafilter. I just have to tamp it down once and brew. I don't know how grind size and grind time might vary from one brand of beans to another.\n\nEarlier: I chose this the Breville because: (1) I have two other Breville machines--a milk frother I bought several years ago, and the Duo-Temp Pro espresso maker, which I purchased in September 2018, and I've been very satisfied with them. (I haven't rated this grinder for durability because I've only had it a short time, but based on the quality and performance of the frother, I expect it and the Duo-Temp Pro espresso maker to hold up just as well); and (2) because I liked the idea of grinding just the right amount of beans directly into the portafilter. On that score, it works great.\n\nOther machines have as many as 60 manual grind adjustments. The Breville's digital display has 58 grind settings, ranging from super dense for Turkish coffee, to very coarse for French press. The display makes grind adjustment easy for anyone.
