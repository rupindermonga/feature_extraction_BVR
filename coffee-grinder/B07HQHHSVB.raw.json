            "reviewText": "After slogging through the various coffee grinders available, I settled on this one from Veken. Why? The first is the attractive price. The second, it is a very good grinder. It is easy to load with beans, grinds the coffee, and the simple instructions on how to get just the right style of ground bean is as simple as it can get. With the included cleaning brush it is a breeze to clean. The added bonus; freshly ground beans have a better flavor. So if you have been hesitating about buying \"whole bean coffee beans\" because you don't want to spend a lot on a grinder and confused about which one to buy, take it from me, you won't go wrong with this one. It really is a \"big bang for the buck.\""

It comes with a small brush that works great for getting the sticky grounds out from around the blade and cup.\n\nAt first it seemed kind of loud, but what doesn't sound loud at 4am? My apartment neighbor hasn't complained so...\n\nIt's fairly consistent. I haven't sent the grounds off to be tested, but my coffee always tastes great and the amount of sediment on the bottom of my coffee cup seems consistent as well.\n\nThe only thing I can't attest to is durability. It seems sturdy enough, but only time will tell. If it lasts a year, I'll consider that a win, it did cost just under $20 after all. If it doesn't, I'll post a follow up."

It grinds well and you can get the beans quite fine if you want them to be (I do).\n\nCleaning is a little difficult as detaching the blade is a lot of work and there is not really a way to safely wash the grinder bowl itself, so you have to use either a brush they provide or a cloth. For that reason, I don't plan on using this for anything but coffee. However, if you intend to just use this for grinding coffee, this little grinder is perfect."

Be aware not that it takes away from quality, capacity space to grind coffee beans is much smaller than Bodum and grinders I've used. In the past.\nThe grinder can be a little messy due to the small circular space on the lid. However Velken is kind enough to include a small brush with grinder for clean up which much better than a separate brush I purchased previously. Plus the grinder is a great space saver for countertops."

The blades on this one are just as sharp as the first one. This one didn't come with a brush, I'm guessing it was just not put in the box, but I ended up buying a small cheap paint brush that does work a lot better than the brush the first one came with. I'm able to grind beans to either fine or coarse for my espresso maker. Just like the first, this little machine packs a punch. Easy to clean and easy to store. I don't regret buying the same one and the first one is still going 5 months later.\nThis grinder is really easy to use. What I like about it is I can either do a coarse or fine grind. The fine does take a little longer. As you can hear in the video, it does make noise but its not that loud. When it comes to cleaning, it is really easy to clean. It did come with a brush, but I found it took a little longer to clean. I bought a small cheap paint brush and it makes cleaning it a lot easier. I do hand wash the lid though. I do keep this on my counters because it hardly takes up space."

The cup for grinding the beans/whatever else seems a little on the small side, and the cup does not come out which makes it a little harder to clean. A brush is provided but with the blade it can be a little hard to brush all the debris out; I'd probably recommend one that has a detachable cup so you can hand wash/rinse out under running water. The lid does seem great on this one and I have not had any issues with grounds flying out."

This one does so far, although I've only used it twice. Easy to use and easier to clean as well. I would recommend not filling any more than half for espresso because the fine grounds stick to the side of the vial due to the centrifugal force. A little loud, but that comes with an electric grinder I suppose. Overall, was a great purchase!"

Today I placed my beans in, it started on its own, threw beans in a 4 foot radius, then never ran again.\nAs for cleaning I never put in water and brushed it after every use, and close inspection of the switch revealed no coffee inside to account for the autonomous running prior and at it's death. I probably used it to grind 10-20g of coffee 150-300 times before it broke, so maybe you are better off spending your money on a different brand or a manual burr grinder."

Just seems like it could have been designed a bit more user friendly. But it works great. I mean it's liketee split and you are finished grinding the beans befor you realize it.\nI am happy with it and I did purchase a good well made product (thus far) which is always my concern when buying electric products online. Just the design could have been better designed. But I do recommend this product."

I was spending a ton of money every week buying iced coffees from DD Sun-Sat, and realized I could save money by brewing my own at home, at least during the work week. As I love Dunkin coffee, I grabbed a bunch of their whole bean coffee bags and purchased this grinder. The coffee really does taste better when freshly ground, and smoother when cold brewed in the fridge! I follow the instructions - only fill with beans 3/4 of the way - and with a few short pulses, I get the coarse-ground coffee required for my Kitchenaid 72 fl oz cold brewer, though I do have to grind several batches to get the 8 oz needed for a full pot. The grinding compartment is easy to clean with the cute little brush. Great price point and happy with my purchase."

A lot of the coffee was stuck to the inside of the chamber. Today I used a series of pulses with much better results. No grounds had stuck to the inside of the chamber. Also the grind was a little less fine, better for a drip machine than powdery coffee. The outer texture is a nice touch, and the removable cord is fantastic. Very pleased."

We found that how finely ground the coffee is was very important.

The Veken coffee grinder is incredibly easy to use, simple to figure out and a great size.

Initially, I timed the grind at 30 seconds and though it performed very well, it actually burned the coffee a bit. Now I grind the beans for 20 seconds straight and then two additional 5 second bursts. Works great and coffee tastes wonderful. It is a very powerful little machine but still new.

So, it's taking me a little practice to get the grind right. One nitpick: the grounds tend to cling to the sides, making it a little tedious to get all of the grinds out. Other grinders have had the same issue, so not unique or a deal breaker."

It was simple to clean and no powder gets left under the blade."

It\u2019s perfect for my Quisinart 12 cup using Starbucks beans, but if you need a larger amount of beans you\u2019ll have to grind two or more batches."

Also, it is better to grind a decent amount because it tends to spin the smaller quantities instead of grinding. The top makes a good seal and it will pretty much powder anything I've put in it so leave the lid on for a minute for the particles to settle. I popped the lid right after grinding the first time and got a plume of lavender dust in the kisser. An easy trick to cleaning it was to drop a small handful of dried rice in and grind for a few seconds. Good purchase and delivered fast."

As I discovered when I grind flax seeds where it is a small struggle to get the results out. I found that putting an equal amount of oatmeal made it a little easy to get the content out, but still cleaning to bowl out is a minor task. Before you buy, note the instruction sheets that come with the unit says, \u201cSolids must contain no moisture\u201d\n\nAnd don\u2019t think you can easily remove the bowl to clean it out and to make sure no moisture is seeping below the bowl. The \u201cHow to Remove the Blade\u201d instructions clearly were written by someone who doesn\u2019t normally write English. My one attempt resulted in my conclusion that removing the bowl would create a safety issue upon re-installing.\n\nThe Amazon description says, \u201cNot just grinding coffee bean, our grinder can also grind spices, nuts, herbs, pepper, seeds, grains and more!\u201d I suspect the reason some customers have complained about the motor burning out have a moisture issue. I mean, don\u2019t even coffee beans have a bit of moisture in them. Well, I now know that most of the seeds, nuts, and herbs I want to grind have moisture in them. My next grinder will need to handle my produce better than this one.\n\nI\u2019ve used my new grinder for about 10 days and intend to keep using it. I wouldn\u2019t recommend this grinder to my friends. Please note that the Amazon description includes this statement: \u201cWe are dedicated to providing the best after-sales service! Just try our products because we are confident that you will love them. If for any reason you don\u2019t absolutely love them, send 1 simple email to us and we will refund your purchase price with no questions asked (In fact, you don't even have to return the grinder).\u201d\n\nThey will soon get an email and I will be looking for a new grinder."
